              "\"Introduction, Research paper, Partnership sourcing is often perceived as the, Pre-construction, best approach to achieving supply chain, project partnering:, improvement through the development of, more effective customer-supplier, from adversarial to, relationships. A large body of literature now, collaborative, exists which presents various approaches to, the general idea from a wide range of, relationships, industrial and academic perspectives (Moore, et al., 1992; Carr and Truesdale, 1992;, Paul Humphreys, Macbeth and Ferguson, 1994), including, Jason Matthews and, dyadic collaborative relationships, the, network concept in relationship marketing, Monan Kumaraswamy, and the development of strategic alliances, (Harland, 1996; Harland et al., 1999)., The authors, Nevertheless, as a number of articles and, Paul Humphreys is a Reader at the School of, reports (Lamming, 1994; Burnes and New,, Management, University of Ulster, Newtownabbey, UK., Jason Matthews is a Research Assistant in the, 1996; Watson, 1999) have shown, this is an, Downloaded by University of East Anglia At 01:45 31 May 2019 (PT), Department of Real Estate and Construction and, area where rhetoric seems to be moving well, Monan Kumaraswamy is Associate Professor, both at, ahead of reality. It is certainly true that, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR., partnership sourcing is described in simplistic, terms, thus making the potential benefits, Keywords, appear easier to achieve than is the case. In, Partnering, Construction industry, Contract labour,, addition, the distribution of the benefits that, Subcontracting, can be achieved through customer-supplier, improvement activities is a more contentious, Abstract, issue than much of the literature, The use of subcontracting within the construction industry, acknowledges., has become commonplace with many main contractors only, New and Ramsey (1997) conducted an, undertaking the management and co-ordination activities., empirical study of the benefits to be gained, The reliance on subcontractors has put much stress on the, main contractor-subcontractor relationship. As main, from collaborative buyer-supplier, contractors have realised that the greatest potential for cost, relationships. They found that the, savings lies with the subcontractors, the prevalence of unfair, distribution of the costs of improvement, practices has increased. This paper describes a procurement, activities were biased towards suppliers rather, approach, utilising limited competition, developed by a, major UK main contractor in order to improve its, than the customer. However, the benefits, relationships with subcontractors. The approach developed, from these activities were biased towards, was based on research which identified: what the main, customers. This is supported within the, contractor's professional employees want from, construction industry, with Watson (1999), subcontractors; what subcontractors want from main, contractors; and a study to compare the main contractor's, noting that despite all the positive publicity of, performance with that of its competitors. It was concluded, partnering, the benefits of effective supply, that this approach offers a number of benefits for the client,, chain partnering are not being passed to, the main contractor, partnering subcontractors and, subcontractors (SCs)., professional consultants, such as, lower costs, improved, team approach and less confrontation., McIvor et al.

An atmosphere of suspicion,, selection process? As Cox and Thompson, founded on previous behaviour, has caused, (1997) point out in their research on, many companies to hold back from trying to, contractual relations in the construction, build closer relationships (A.T. Kearney,, industry, there is no single optimum buyer-, 1994). Moore et al. (1992), Harbuck et al., supplier relationship. Second, the model, (1994) and Dainty et al. (2001) develop this, represents an idealised scenario, where a firm, point further. They concluded, in the context, wants to form a collaborative relationship. As, of construction, that the working behaviour is, already indicated, in many instances,, negatively affected by traditional working, organisations may have difficulty in, approaches. In practice most relationships are, implementing this approach. Consequently,, still dominated by the relative and perceived, does the evolution of a partnering relationship, power of the participants. The terms of, need to be refined to provide an incremental, collaboration tend to reinforce dependent, development path, rather than one which, power relations, with the buyer usually telling, requires organisations to be revolutionary in, the suppliers what they require from them., their approach? In this article, a case study is, A growing body of research in purchasing, presented from the UK construction industry, partnerships is developing. Work has been, which proposes an alternative methodology, Downloaded by University of East Anglia At 01:45 31 May 2019 (PT), undertaken that describes the different types, for implementing a partnering relationship., of relationships, the benefits and problems, The proposed partnering framework draws on, associated with partnering, the philosophical, the professional experiences of the main, issues a firm must address in shaping its, participants, as well as taking into account, attitudes toward suppliers and the changes, best practice within the industry. However,, required in a firm's operating procedures, before proceeding to the case study, it is, before supplier partnerships can be, necessary to examine how the procurement, implemented successfully. The need for, process has evolved within the construction, forming partnerships and the potential, industry and the types of relationship to be, benefits of forming them are also recurring, found. It should also be pointed out that the, themes in the literature. There appears to be a, paper focuses on the pre-construction phase., This refers to all activities up to the point of, consensus in the literature that supplier, placing a contract and does not include the, partnerships develop over time. However,, physical building process., only a limited amount of previous work, prescribes a specific path for developing and, implementing successful partnerships. Ellram, (1991) and Crane et al. (1997) propose, Construction partnering defined, normative development guides which are, This section does not seek to be exhaustive in, based on case study material, empirical data, discussing these trends, as much work has, and the findings from the literature. The, been undertaken in this respect by other, models identify five main phases in the, commentators (Reading Construction, evolution of purchasing partnerships:, Forum, 1995, 1998; CII, 1991; NEDO,, (1) internal alignment;, 1991; Crowley and Karim, 1995; AGC,, (2) identify potential partners;, 1991; Barlow and Jashapara, 1998)., (3) screen and select;, However, the following will highlight the, (4) establish relationships; and, main relevant themes and points that should, (5) evaluate relationship., be borne in mind when developing partnering, These phases are not meant to be mutually, relationships., exclusive, but represent a potentially iterative, Partnering has become an increasingly, process that is dynamic in nature., popular form of business relationship within, The models, outlined above, are useful in, the construction industry over the last decade, providing a generic framework within which a, (Crane et al., 1997). The adoption of, collaborative relationship should evolve., partnering into the construction industries of, However, it does raise a number of important, the USA, Australia and the UK can be, questions with regard to the limitations of the, attributed to the fact that relationships in, models developed. First, are there, these industries were commonly lacking trust,, 167, Pre-construction project partnering, Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, Paul Humphreys, Jason Matthews and Monan Kumaraswamy, Volume 8 .

This had led to, practiced on fragmented projects it required, procurement problems, with claims,, national ``lobbying'' in order that partnering is, litigation, and unsatisfied clients being, used across industry under the correct, common., circumstances. In the UK, the RCF (1998), Two major reports funded by the British, develop this point further by stating that new, Government (Egan, 1998; Latham, 1994), initiatives in partnering have enabled ``second, have provided increased impetus to improve, and third generation partnering'' to evolve., the relationships between all parties involved, Second generation partnering was, in construction procurement. Partnering was, underpinned by the ``seven pillars'' of, seen by many as the key to achieving this, partnering, these being strategy, membership,, improvement. In addition, Egan (1998), equity, integration, benchmarks, project, pointed out that partnering through the, processes and feedback. In the third, supply chain is a critical approach with which, generation of partnering the construction firm, the UK construction industry can drive, should be building virtual organisations with, innovation and sustain incremental, its supply chain to provide a complete service, improvement in performance. This emphasis, which is efficient, creative and innovative., on partnerships is supported by Hayward, Table I compares four studies on partnering, (1999) and Whitelaw (1999) through the, undertaken between 1991 and 1996 in the, Downloaded by University of East Anglia At 01:45 31 May 2019 (PT), Movement for Innovation initiative, where, USA and the UK. It highlights the main, substantial improvements in terms of, for, elements of partnering as identified from, example, cost reduction, quality, work, these studies., environments and project management have, Such consideration of the main elements, of, been identified., both generic, project and strategic partnering, One of the most commonly cited definitions, has been commonplace within the partnering, for partnering is that of the Construction, literature since its first implementation in the, Industry Institute (CII, 1991), formulated, late 1980s. Several commentators (for, after studying 27 partnering case studies in, example, Cook and Hancher (1990); AGC, the USA:, (1991); Mosley et al. (1991); Sanders and, . . . a long-term commitment between two or, Moore (1992); Harbuck et al.

The relationship is, discussed partnering in the context of the, based on trust, dedication to common goals, and, MC-SC relationship., an understanding of each other's individual, expectations and values., The vast majority of partnering, MC-SC relationship in the construction, commentators (RCF, 1995) discuss, industry, partnering in the context of either project, partnering or strategic partnering.

Project partnering was pioneered, Traditionally, MCs would execute most of a, in the USA construction industry during the, project using directly employed labour., mid to late 1980s., However, the dramatic increase in the use of, Strategic partnering takes place when two, SCs has resulted in up to 90 per cent of the, or more firms use partnering on a long-term, value of work undertaken on a construction, basis to undertake more than one, project being subcontracted (Nobbs, 1993)., construction project, or some continuing, Jamieson et al.

Moreover, many of the bad traits, Nobbs (1993) attributed the increased, common to the MC-SC relationship are also, involvement of SCs to the shift away from the, common at lower levels in the supply chain, traditional craft-base, to a greater reliance on, (Matthews, 1996)., increasingly sophisticated technology-based, Hinze and Tracey (1994) described the, products.

A major requirement, for successful partnering implementation,, trust, is just beginning to be actively, cultivated. The lack of senior management, commitment, the lack of appropriate support, structures and the widespread ignorance of, supply chain philosophy need to be addressed, within the construction industry. As Briscoe, et al. (2001) confirm, attitudinal change is, required throughout the construction, industry if SCs are to be integrated into the, supply chain. One mechanism for introducing, such change is the education of the, construction workforce in terms of managerial, skills, such as, developing communication, skills, knowledge of other organisations, operating in the construction supply chain, and the potential benefits of partnering. The, Construction Industry Training Board, the, national training organisation for the, industry, is well aware of the need to train for, soft skills and has begun to develop initiatives, in this direction (Barrie, 1999)., 176, Pre-construction project partnering, Supply Chain Management: An International Journal, Paul Humphreys, Jason Matthews and Monan Kumaraswamy, Volume 8 .
