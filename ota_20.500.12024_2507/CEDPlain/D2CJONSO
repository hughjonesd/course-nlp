Wee are heere before 'hem, me thinkes.
   [$QVAR.$] All the better, we shall see 'hem come in now.
   [$LEA.$] What doe you lacke, Gentlemen, what is't you lacke? a 
fine Horse? a Lyon? a Bull? a Beare? a Dog, or a Cat? an 
excellent fine (^Bartholmew-bird^) ? or an Instrument? what is't you
lacke?
   [$QVAR.$] S'lid! heere's (^Orpheus^) among the beasts, with his
Fiddle, and all!
   [$TRA.$] Will you buy any comfortable bread, Gentlemen?
   [$QVAR.$] And (^Ceres^) selling her daughters picture, in
Ginger-worke!
   [$WIN.$] That these people should be so ignorant to thinke vs
chapmen for 'hem! doe wee looke as if wee would buy
Ginger-bread? or Hobby-horses?
   [$QVAR.$] Why, they know no better ware then they haue, nor 
better customers then come. And our very being here makes vs fit 
to be demanded, as well as others. Would (^Cokes^) would come! 
there were a true customer for 'hem.
   [$KNO.$] How much is't? thirty shillings? who's yonder! (^Ned
Winwife^) ? and (^Tom Quarlous^) , I thinke! yes, (gi' me it all) (gi' 
me it all) Master (^Win-wife^) ! Master (^Quarlous^) ! will you take a
pipe 
of tabacco with vs? do not discredit me now, (^Zekiel^) .
   [$WIN.$] Doe not see him! he is the roaring horse-courser, pray
thee let's auoyd him: turne downe this way.
   [$QVAR.$] S'lud, I'le see him, and roare with him, too, and hee
roar'd as loud as (^Neptune^) , pray thee goe with me.
   [$WIN.$] You may draw me to as likely an inconuenience, when 
you please, as this.
   [$QVAR.$] Goe to then, come along, we ha' nothing to doe, man, 
but to see sights, now.
   [$KNO.$] Welcome Master (^Quarlous^) , and Master (^Winwife^) !   #
will 
you take any froth, and smoake with vs?
   [$QVAR.$] Yes, Sir, but you'l pardon vs, if we knew not of so much
familiarity betweene vs afore.
   [$KNO.$] As what, Sir?
   [$QVAR.$] To be so lightly inuited to smoake, and froth.
   [$KNO.$] A good vapour! will you sit downe, Sir? this is old
<P 25>
(^Vrsla's^) mansion, how like you her bower? heere you may ha' your
Punque, and your Pigge in state, Sir, both piping hot.
   [$QVAR.$] I had rather ha' my Punque, cold, Sir.
   [$IVS.$] There's for me, Punque! and Pigge!

[$ (^She calls within.^) $]

   [$VRS.$] What (^Moonecalfe^) ? you Rogue.
   [$MOO.$] By and by, the bottle is almost off Mistresse, here
Master (^Arthur^) .   
   [$VRS.$] I'le part you, and your play-fellow there, i' the garded
coat, an' you sunder not the sooner.
   [$KNO.$] Master (^Win-wife^) , you are proud (me thinkes) you doe #
not 
talke, nor drinke, are you proud?
   [$WIN.$] Not of the company I am in, Sir, nor the place, I assure
you.
   [$KNO.$] You doe not except at the company! doe you? are you
in vapours, Sir?
   [$MOO.$] Nay, good Master (^Dan: Knockhum^) , respect my Mistris
Bower, as you call it; for the honour of our Booth, none o' your
vapours, heere.

[$ (^She comes out with a fire-brand.^) $]

   [$VRS.$] Why, you thinne leane Polcat you, and they haue a 
minde to be i' their vapours, must you hinder 'hem? what did you
know Vermine, if they would ha' lost a cloake, or such a trifle?
must you be drawing the ayre of pacification heere? while I am
tormented, within, i' the fire, you Weasell?
   [$MOO.$] Good Mistresse, 'twas in the behalfe of your Booth's
credit, that I spoke.
   [$VRS,$] Why? would my Booth ha' broake, if they had fal'ne 
out in't? Sir? or would their heate ha' fir'd it? in, you Rogue, and
wipe the pigges, and mend the fire, that they fall not, or I'le both 
baste and roast you, till your eyes drop out, like 'hem. (Leaue the
bottle behinde you, and be
curst a while.)
   [$QVAR.$] Body o' the (^Fayre^) ! what's this? mother o' the Bawds?
   [$KNO.$] No, she's mother o' the Pigs, Sir, mother o' the Pigs!
   [$WIN.$] Mother o' the (^Furies^) , I thinke, by her firebrand.
   [$QVAR.$] Nay, shee is too fat to be a (^Fury^) , sure, some      #
walking 
Sow of tallow!
   [$WIN.$] An inspir'd vessell of Kitchin-stuffe!

[$ (^She drinkes this while.^) $]

   [$QVAR.$] She'll make excellent geere for the Coach-makers, here 
in Smithfield, to anoynt wheeles and axell trees with.
   [$VRS.$] I, I, Gamesters, mocke a plaine plumpe soft wench o' 
the Suburbs, doe, because she's iuicy and wholesome: you must 
ha' your thinne pinch'd ware, pent vp i' the compasse of a
dogge-collar, (or 'twill not do) that lookes like a long lac'd       #
(^Conger^) , set 
vpright, and a greene feather, like fennell i' the Ioll on't.
   [$KNO.$] Well said (^Vrs^) , my good (^Vrs^) ; to 'hem (^Vrs^) .
   [$QVAR.$] Is shee your quagmire, (^Dan: Knockhum^) ? is this your
Bogge?
   [$NIG.$] We shall haue a quarrel presently.
<P 26>
   [$KNO.$] How? Bog? Quagmire? foule vapours! hum'h!
   [$QVAR.$] Yes, hee that would venture for't, I assure him, might
sinke into her, and be drown'd a weeke, ere any friend hee had, 
could find where he were.
   [$WIN.$] And then he would be a fort'night weighing vp againe.
   [$QVAR.$] 'Twere like falling into a whole (^Shire^) of butter:   #
they 
had need be a teeme of (^Dutchmen^) , should draw him out.
   [$KNO.$] Answer 'hem, (^Vrs^) , where's thy (^Bartholmew-wit^) ,  #
now? 
(^Vrs^) , thy (^Bartholmew-wit^) ?
   [$VRS.$] Hang 'hem, rotten, roguy Cheaters, I hope to see 'hem
plagu'd one day (pox'd they are already, I am sure) with leane 
playhouse poultry, that has the boany rumpe, sticking out like the Ace
of Spades, or the point of a Partizan, that euery rib of 'hem is like 
the tooth of a Saw: and [^SOURCE TEXT: aud^] will so grate 'hem with #
their hips, &
shoulders, as (take 'hem altogether) they were as good lye with a    #
hurdle.
   [$QVAR.$] Out vpon her, how she drips! she's able to giue a man 
the sweating Sicknesse, with looking on her.
   [$VRS.$] Mary looke off, with a patch o' your face; and a dosen 
i' your breech, though they be o' scarlet, Sir. I ha' seene as fine
outsides, as either o' yours, bring lowsie linings to the Brokers, ere
now, twice a weeke?
   [$QVAR.$] Doe you thinke there may be a fine new Cuckingstoole 
i' the (^Fayre^) , to be purchas'd? one large inough, I meane. I know 
there is a pond of capacity, for her.
   [$VRS.$] For your mother, you Rascall, out you Rogue, you hedge
bird, you Pimpe, you pannier-mans bastard, you.
   [$QVAR.$] Ha, ha, ha.
   [$VRS.$] Doe you sneere, you dogs-head, you (^Trendle tayle^) ! you
looke as you were begotten a' top of a Cart in haruest-time, when 
the whelp was hot and eager. Go, snuffe after your brothers bitch,
M=rs= (^Commodity^) , that's the Liuory you weare, 'twill be out at  #
the 
elbows, shortly. It's time you went to't, for the to'ther remnant.
   [$KNO.$] Peace, (^Vrs^) , peace, (^Vrs^) , they'll kill the poore #
Whale, and 
make oyle of her. Pray thee goe in.
   [$VRS.$] I'le see 'hem pox'd first, and pil'd, and double pil'd.
   [$WIN.$] Let's away, her language growes greasier then her Pigs.
   [$VRS.$] Dos't so, snotty nose? good Lord! are you sniueling? 
you were engendred on a she-begger, in a barne, when the bald
Thrasher, your Sire, was scarce warme.
   [$WIN.$] Pray thee, let's goe.
   [$QVAR.$] No, faith: I'le stay the end of her, now: I know shee
cannot last long; I finde by her (^similes^) , shee wanes a pace.
   [$VRS.$] Do's shee so? I'le set you gone. Gi' mee my Pig-pan 
hither a little. I'le scald you hence, and you will not goe.
   [$KNO.$] Gentlemen, these are very strange vapours! and very
idle vapours! I assure you.
   [$QVAR.$] You are a very serious asse, wee assure you.
<P 27>
   [$KNO.$] Humh! Asse? and serious? nay, then pardon mee my 
vapour. I haue a foolish vapour, Gentlemen: any man that doe's 
vapour me, the Asse, Master (^Quarlous^) -- 
   [$QVAR.$] What then, Master (^Iordan^) ?
   [$KNO.$] I doe vapour him the lye.
   [$QVAR.$] Faith, and to any man that vapours mee the lie, I doe
vapour that. 
   [$KNO.$] Nay, then, vapours vpon vapours.

[$Vrsla (^comes in, with the scalding-pan. They fight. Shee falls with
it^) .$]

   [$EDG. NIG.$] 'Ware the pan, the pan, the pan, shee comes with 
the pan, Gentlemen. God blesse the woman.       
   [$VRS.$] Oh.

   [$MOO.$] Mistresse!                                          
   [$VRS.$] Curse of hell, that euer I saw these Feinds, oh! I ha'
scalded my leg, my leg, my leg, my leg. I ha' lost a limb in the     #
seruice! 
run for some creame and sallad oyle, quickly. Are you 
vnder-peering, you Baboun? rip off my hose, an' you be men, men, men.
   [$MOO.$] Runne you for some creame, good mother (^Ione^) . I'le
looke to your basket.
   [$LEA.$] Best sit vp i' your chaire, (^Vrsla^) . Helpe, Gentlemen.
   [$KNO.$] Be of a good cheere, (^Vrs^) , thou hast hindred me the
currying of a couple of Stallions, here, that abus'd the good        #
(^race-Bawd^) [^NO ITALICS FOR race IN SOURCE TEXT^]
o' Smithfield; 'twas time for 'hem to goe.
   [$NIG.$] I faith, when the panne came, they had made you runne
else. (this had beene a fine time for purchase, if you had 
ventur'd.)
   [$EDG.$] Not a whit, these fellowes were too fine to carry
money.
   [$KNO.$] (^Nightingale^) , get some helpe to carry her legge out  #
o' the 
ayre; take off her shooes; body o' me, she has the Mallanders, the 
scratches, the crowne scabbe, and the quitter bone, i' the 
tother legge.
   [$VRS.$] Oh! the poxe, why doe you put me in minde o' my leg, 
thus, to make it prick, and shoot? would you ha' me i' the 
Hospitall, afore my time?
   [$KNO.$] Patience, (^Vrs^) , take a good heart, 'tis but a        #
blister, as 
big as a Windgall; I'le take it away with the white of an egge, a 
little honey, and hogs grease, ha' thy pasternes well rol'd, and thou
shall't pase againe by to morrow. I'le tend thy Booth, and looke to

These are the fruites of the bottle-ale, and tabacco! the some of the
one, and the fumes of the other! Stay young man, and despise 
not the wisedome of these few hayres, that are growne gray in care 
of thee.
   [$EDG.$] (^Nightingale^) , stay a little. Indeede I'le heare some #
o' 
this!
   [$COK.$] Come, (^Numps^) , come, where are you? welcome into 
the (^Fayre^) , Mistris (^Grace^) .
   [$EDG.$] S'light, hee will call company, you shall see, and put vs 
into doings presently.
   [$IVS.$] Thirst not after that frothy liquor, Ale: for, who knowes,
when hee openeth the stopple, what may be in the bottle? hath 
not a Snaile, a Spider, yea, a Neuft bin found there? thirst not 
after it, youth: thirst not after it.
   [$COK.$] This is a braue fellow, (^Numps^) , let's heare him.
   [$WAS.$] S'blood, how braue is he? in a garded coate? you were 
best trucke with him, e'en strip, and trucke presently, it will 
become you, why will you heare him, because he is an Asse, and may 
be a kinne [^SOURCE TEXT: kinnne^] to the (^Cokeses^) ?
   [$COK.$] O, good (^Numps^) !
   [$IVS.$] Neither doe thou lust after that tawney weede, tabacco.
   [$COK.$] Braue words!
   [$IVS.$] Whose complexion is like the Indians that vents it!
   [$COK.$] Are they not braue words, Sister?
   [$IVS.$] And who can tell, if, before the gathering, and making
vp thereof, the (^Alligarta^) hath not piss'd thereon?
   [$WAS.$] 'Heart let 'hem be braue words, as braue as they will!
and they were all the braue words in a Countrey, how then? will 
you away yet? ha' you inough on him? Mistris (^Grace^) , come you
away, I pray you, be not you accessary. If you doe lose your 
Licence, or somewhat else, Sir, with listning to his fables: say,    #
(^Numps^) ,
is a witch, with all my heart, doe, say so.
   [$COK.$] Avoyd i' your sattin doublet, (^Numps^) .
   [$IVS.$] The creeping venome of which subtill serpent, as some 
<P 29>
late writers affirme; neither the cutting of the perrillous plant, 
nor the drying of it, nor the lighting, or burning, can any way 
perssway, or asswage.
   [$COK.$] Good, i' faith! is't not Sister?
   [$IVS.$] Hence it is, that the lungs of the Tabacconist are rotted,
the Liuer spotted, the braine smoak'd like the backside of the
Pig-womans Booth, here, and the whole body within, blacke, as her 
Pan, you saw e'en now, without.
   [$COK.$] A fine similitude, that, Sir! did you see the panne?
   [$EDG.$] Yes, Sir.
   [$IVS.$] Nay, the hole in the nose heere, of some tabacco-takers,
or the third nostrill, (if I may so call it) which makes, that they  #
can 
vent the tabacco out, like the Ace of clubs, or rather the
Flower-de-lice, is caused from the tabacco, the meere tabacco! when  #
the 
poore innocent pox, hauing nothing to doe there, is miserably, 
and most vnconscionably slander'd.
   [$COK.$] Who would ha' mist this, Sister?
   [$OVER.$] Not any body, but (^Numps^) .
   [$COK.$] He do's not vnderstand.
   [$EDG.$] Nor you feele.

[$ (^Hee picketh his purse.^) $]

   [$COK.$] What would you haue, Sister, of a fellow that knowes
nothing but a basket-hilt, and an old Fox in't? the best musique 
i' the (^Fayre^) , will not moue a logge.
   [$EDG.$] In, to (^Vrsla, Nightingale^) , and carry her comfort:   #
see it 
told. This fellow was sent to vs by fortune, for our first fairing.
   [$IVS.$] But what speake I of the diseases of the body, children of 
the (^Fayre^) ?
   [$COK.$] That's to vs, Sister. Braue i' faith!
   [$IVS.$] Harke, O, you sonnes and daughters of Smithfield! and
heare what mallady it doth the minde: It causeth swearing, it 
causeth swaggering, it causeth snuffling, and snarling, and now and
then a hurt.
   [$OVE.$] He hath something of Master (^Ouerdoo^) , mee thinkes,
brother.
   [$COK.$] So mee thought, Sister, very much of my brother
(^Ouerdoo^) : And 'tis, when he speakes.
   [$IVS.$] Looke into any Angle o' the towne, (the Streights, or the
(^Bermuda's^) where the quarrelling lesson is read, and how doe 
they entertaine the time, but with bottle-ale, and tabacco? The
Lecturer is o' one side, and his Pupils o' the other; But the seconds
are still bottle-ale, and tabacco, for which the Lecturer reads, and
the Nouices pay. Thirty pound a weeke in bottle-ale! forty in 
tabacco! and ten more in Ale againe. Then for a sute to drinke in, 
so much, and (that being slauer'd) so much for another sute, and 
then a third sute, and a fourth sute! and still the bottle-ale
slauereth, and the tabacco stinketh!
   [$WAS.$] Heart of a mad-man! are you rooted heere? will           #
[^SOURCE TEXT: well^] you 
<P 30>
neuer away? what can any man finde out in this bawling fellow, 
to grow heere for? hee is a full handfull higher, sin' he heard him,
will you fix heere? and set vp a Booth? Sir?
   [$IVS.$] I will conclude briefely --
   [$WAS.$] Hold your peace, you roaring Rascall, I'le runne 
my head i' your chaps else. You were best build a Booth, and
entertaine him, make your Will, and you say the word, and him your
heyre! heart, I neuer knew one taken with a mouth of a pecke, 
afore. By this light, I'le carry you away o' my backe, and you will
not come.

[$ (^He gets him vp on pick-packe.^) $]

purse, 
(^Numpes^) , O my purse! one o' my fine purses is gone.
   [$OVER.$] Is't indeed, brother?
   [$COK.$] I, as I am an honest man, would I were an errant Rogue,
else! a plague of all roguy, damn'd cut-purses for me.
   [$WAS.$] Blesse 'hem with all my heart, with all my heart, do you
see! Now, as I am no Infidell, that I know of, I am glad on't. I 
I am, (here's my witnesse!) doe you see, Sir? I did not tell you of
his fables, I? no, no, I am a dull malt-horse, I, I know nothing. Are
you not iustly seru'd i' your conscience now? speake i' your
conscience. Much good doe you with all my heart, and his good heart
that has it, with all my heart againe.
   [$EDG.$] This fellow is very charitable, would he had a purse too!
but, I must not be too bold, all at a time.
   [$COK.$] Nay, (^Numps^) , it is not my best purse.
   [$WAS.$] Not your best! death! why should it be your worst? 
why should it be any, indeed, at all? answer me to that, gi' mee a
reason from you, why it should be any?
   [$COK.$] Nor my gold, (^Numps^) ; I ha' that yet, looke heere else,
Sister.
   [$WAS.$] Why so, there's all the feeling he has!
   [$OVER.$] I pray you, haue a better care of that, brother.
   [$COK.$] Nay, so I will, I warrant you; let him catch this, that
catch can. I would faine see him get this, looke you
heere.
   [$WAS.$] So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so! Very good.
   [$COK.$] I would ha' him come againe, now, and but offer at it.
Sister, will you take notice of a good iest? I will put it iust where
th'other was, and if we ha' good lucke, you shall see a delicate fine
trap to catch the cutpurse, nibling.
   [$EDG.$] Faith, and he'll trye ere you be out o' the (^Fayre^) .
   [$COK.$] Come, Mistresse (^Grace^) , pre'thee be not melancholy for
my mis-chance; sorrow wi' not keepe it, Sweet heart.

I will make no more orations, shall draw on these tragicall
conclusions. And I begin now to thinke, that by a spice of
collaterall Iustice, (^Adam Ouerdoo^) , deseru'd this beating; for I #
the said (^Adam^) , 
was one cause (a by-cause) why the purse was lost: and my wiues
brothers purse too, which they know not of yet. But I shall make
very good mirth with it, at supper, (that will be the sport) and put
my little friend, M=r= (^Humphrey Wasp's^) choler quite out of
countenance. When, sitting at the vpper end o' my Table, as I vse, &
drinking to my brother (^Cokes^) , and M=rs=. (^Alice Ouerdoo^) , as #
I wil, my wife, for 
their good affectio~ to old (^Bradley^) , I deliuer to 'hem, it was  #
I, that was 
cudgell'd, and shew 'hem the marks. To see what bad euents may 
peepe out o' the taile of good purposes! the care I had of that ciuil
yong man, I tooke fancy to this morning, (and haue not left it yet)
drew me to that exhortation, which drew the company, indeede         #
[^SOURCE TEXT: indeeede^] ,
which drew the cut-purse; which drew the money; which drew 
my brother (^Cokes^) his losse; which drew on (^Wasp's^) anger; which
drew on my beating: a pretty gradation! And they shall ha' it 
i' their dish, i' faith, at night for fruit: I loue to be merry at my
Table. I had thought once, at one speciall blow he ga' me, to haue
reuealed my selfe? but then (I thank thee fortitude) I remembred
that a wise man (and who is euer so great a part, o' the 
Common-wealth in himselfe) for no particular disaster ought to       #
abandon a
publike good designe. The husbandman ought not for one
vnthankful yeer, to forsake the plough; The Shepheard ought not, for
one scabb'd sheep, to throw by his tar-boxe; The Pilot ought not 
for one leake i' the poope, to quit the Helme; Nor the Alderman 
ought not for one custerd more, at a meale, to giue vp his cloake; 
The Constable ought not to breake his staffe, and forsweare the 
watch, for one roaring night; Nor the Piper o' the Parish            #
(\ (Vt 
paruis componere magna solebam) \) to put vp his pipes, for one rainy
Sunday. These are certaine knocking conclusions; out of which, 
I am resolu'd, come what come can, come beating, come
imprisonment, come infamy, come banishment, nay, come the rack, come
the hurdle, (welcome all) I will not discouer who I am, till my 
due time; and yet still, all shall be, as I said euer, in Iustice    #
