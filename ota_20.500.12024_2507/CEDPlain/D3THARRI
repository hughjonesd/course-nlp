<P 4>
   [$Cryer.$] (^Hardresse Waller^) Knight, (^hold up thy hand, what  #
sayest
thou, art thou guilty of this horrid Act of Treason whereof thou
standest indicted, or not guilty^) .
   [$ (^Hard. Wall.^) $] My Lord, I cannot say, I am not guilty.
   [$Cler.$] (^Then you plead, you are guilty.^) 
   [$ (^Hard.^) $] Yes my Lord, I am guilty.
   [$Cler.$] (^Set him aside.^)
Thomas Harison, (^Hold up thy hand, art thou guilty or not guilty^) .
   [$ (^Har.^) $] If I should say I am not guilty, I should wrong my #
own
conscience, yet in matter and form as it is laid down in this
Indictment, I am not guilty.
   [$Cler.$] Then you plead not guilty.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] My Lord, I desire I may have counsell afforded me, #
and
time to make my defence, for I have been kept close prisoner in a
dark Chamber, and had no notice of my Tryal till five of the clock
in the morning, that I am altogether unprepared.
   [$Judge,$] (^You are to plead guilty or not guilty, for in cases  #
of
Treason Counsel is not to be assigned, for that would make it
justifiable, and that it were not Treason, and you would be quit,    #
but if
it be treason, then it is not justifiable.^)
   [$ (^Har.^) $] I am not guilty.
   [$Cler.$] (^How wilt thou be tryed.^)
   [$ (^Har.^) $] By the Lords Lawes, and by the good and wholesome
Laws of the Land.
   [$Cler.$] (^Wilt thou be tryed by God and the Countrey.^)
   [$ (^Har.^) He answered that was a profane word.$]
   [$ (^Then the Judge answered^) ,$] (^he shall be turned over to   #
God and the
Countrey.^) 
   [$Har.$] (^No Sir, I will be tryed by God and the Country.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] God send thee a good deliverance, [$and turn'd    #
him aside.$]
Henry Heveningham, (^hold up thy hand, guilty or not guilty^) .
   [$ (^Hev.^) $] Not guilty.
   [$Cler.$] (^How wilt thou be tryed.^)
   [$Hev.$] I will present an humble Petition to His Majesty and the
Parliament, and desire your Lordships to let me return to my
lodgings in the Tower, for I have some infirmities upon me.
<P 5>
   [$Judge,$] (^We can give you no answer to that,^)
   [$Cler.$] How wilt thou be tryed?
   [$Hev.$] (^By God and the Countrey.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] God send thee a good deliverance.
(^Set them by, Bring^) Isaac Pennington, Henry Martin, Gilbert
Millington, Robert Tichborn, and Robert Lilborn (^to the Bar^) .
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] Henry Martin, (^Hold up thy hand to the Bar, what #
sayest
thou, art guilty of this horrid act of Treason whereof thou standest 
indicted or not guilty^) .
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] My Lord, I desire the benefit of the Act of        #
Indempnity.
   [$Judge,$] (^First you are to plead before you can have the       #
benefit of
any thing, and for your pleading the Act of Indemnity that makes
you guilty.^)
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] My Lord, If I plead, I loose the benefit of that   #
Act.
   [$Judge,$] (^Your name is in that Act.^)
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] My name is not there my Lord, my name is (^Henry 
Marten^) , not (^Martin^) , [$Then the Judge said$] there is no      #
difference
between (^Martin^) and (^Marten^) in Law, the difference is very     #
little in
the sound, [$then said the Clerk,$] art thou guilty or not guilty.
   [$ (^The Judge bid him^) $] (^be advised, for it makes no         #
difference if there
were two names of the like form, the difference is betwixt the six
Names, and 'twill but make you a Mute in Law, and a Mute in
Treason, Sir, you must have Judgement passed on you^) .
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] Are you guilty or not guilty.
   [$Mar.$] (^I desire Counsel my Lord in that which is matter of    #
Law.^)
   [$ (^Judg.^) $] What do you desire counsel for? you are indicted  #
for
matter of Treason, for Contriving and Composing the Kings
death: you have justification to plead if it be Treason, it is not
justifiable; or if it be justifiable, it is not Treason.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] (^Then my Lord I plead not guilty.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] How will you be tryed?
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] (^By God and the Countrey.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] God send thee a good deliverance.
   [$Judge,$] (^You may give any Evidence, but in a case of this     #
nature
you can give no Evidence.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] (^Gilbert Millingtoun^) , Hold up thy hand, what  #
sayst thou
<P 6>
art guilty of this horrid Act of Treason or not guilty.
   [$Mil.$] (^I humbly crave your Lordships pardon in some few       #
words.^)
   [$ (^Judg.^) $] Sir we must do in this case as in all other       #
cases, either
you must plead guilty or not, if you plead not guilty, you shall be
heard hereafter: but you must plead guilty or not guilty.
   [$Mil.$] (^There is something in that Indictment which I am not   # 
guilty of.^)
   [$ (^Jud.^) $] Then plead not guilty.
   [$Mil.$] (^I am not guilty my Lord.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] How wilt thou be tryed?
   [$M.$] (^By God and my Countrey.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] God send thee a good deliverance.
   [$Cler.$] Robert Tichborn, (^hold up thy hand, art thou guilty of
this horrid Act of Treason, or not guilty^) .
   [$ (^Tich.^) $] My Lord, I have for some space been kept close    #
prisoner,
and I am altogether unable in the Law to speak for my self.
   [$Jud.$] (^You must plead guilty, or not guilty.^)
   [$ (^Tich.^) $] Spare me one word, if the Tryal be matter of Law, #
give
leave for Counsel to plead for me: if I should plead my own case
in Law, I might be overpowred, since there are many persons of
great eminency and honour will plead against me, but I will not
trouble you long if this be the case in matter and form as I am
here Indicted, I am not guilty.
   [$Cler.$] (^How wilt thou be tryed?^)
   [$ (^Tich.^) $] [^NO SPEAKER NAME GIVEN IN SOURCE TEXT.^] By God  #
and the Country.
   [$Cler.$] (^God send you a good deliverance.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] Owen Roe, Hold up your hand, art thou guilty of   # 
this
horrid act of Treason or not guilty.
   [$Owen Roe,$] (^My Lord, I will rest upon the Judgement of the
Court, in matter and form as I stand indicted, I am not guilty.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] How wilt thou be try'd?
   [$Owen Roe,$] (^By God and the Country.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] God send thee a good deliverance.
   [$Cler.$] Robert Lilburn, (^Hold up thy hand, art thou guilty or  #
not 
guilty^) ?
   [$ (^Lilburn,^) $] I have been close Prisoner my Lord these twenty 
dayes, and none suffered to come to me, and I am told that I
ought to have counsel before I plead.
<P 7>
   [$Judg.$] (^You are misinformed, you cannot have it, you must     #
plead
guilty or not guilty, for if this be your argument, and this answer
return of Iudgement will be given against you, for the rule is set
before us.^)
   [$ (^Lilborn,^) $] My Lord, if you over rule me, I cannot help it.
   [$Judg.$] (^Sir, Pray let no such words fall from your mouth.^)
   [$ (^Lilborn,^) $] My Lord, I must say in matter and form as I    #
stand
indicted, I am not guilty.
   [$Cler.$] (^How wilt thou be try'd?^)
   [$L.$] By God and the Country.
   [$Cler.$] (^God send thee a good deliverance.^)
   [$Cler.$] Call (^Adrian Scroop, Augustine Garland, Gregory Clement,
Peter Temple, John Jones, Iames Temple, Iohn Cook, Iohn Carew^) ,
[$all which held up their hands as others before by degrees, 
pleading not guilty?$]
[$Afterwards was called (^Tho. Scot, Henry Smith, Gregory Clement,
Vincent Potter, Edmund Harvy, Tho. Wait, Hugh Peters^) , to hold up 
their hands and read the Charge,$] are ye guilty or not guilty?
   [$Pet.$] (^I cannot say I am guilty my Lord, for I would not be   #
guilty
of the murder for ten thousand Worlds.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] How wilt thou be tryed.
   [$Pet.$] (^By the word of God^) ; [$at which the Court smiled.$]
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] Art thou guilty or not guilty.
   [$Pet.$] (^Not guilty.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] How wilt thou be tryed.
   [$Pet.$] (^By God and the Countrey.^)
   [$ (^Cler.^) $] God send thee a good deliverance.
[$George Fleetwood (^being call'd to the Bar, held up his hand as
before, and confest himself guilty: But the others pleaded not       #
guilty^) .$]
