<P 10>
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Mr. (^Wheatley^) , will you give an 
Account what happen'd to you, on the Fifth of
(^June^) last, and how far it concerns the
Prisoner?
   [$Mr. (^Wheatley.^) $] On the 5th of (^June^) last, I
happened to be at the Tennis Court, and staid
there till about three o'Clock. While I was
there, the Prisoner was standing talking with
One (^Warren^) , and then came up to me, and
inquired of me, when I should see my Lord (^John
Sackville^) , for he wanted to know if my Lord
would play the Match out, that if he did not care
to play it he should pay; I told him that if my
<P 11>
my Lord (^John^) owed him any Money he would
pay him without doubt, that I was going down to
(^Bedford^) with him to Morrow and would speak to
him, I then asked the Prisoner how much it was?
and he told me there were twenty Guneas due to
him for a Horse and Fifty Guineas at Tennis, I
replied that if my Lord (^John^) would give me an
Order, I would pay the Money (^instantly^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did You offer to pay the Money then?
   [$Mr. (^Wheatley.^) $] I said I would (^instantly^) , my
Lord! provided I had an Order from my Lord
(^John^) . I staid there till about three o'Clock and
then I went into the City, intending to dine at a
Friend's House, but I met with some
Acquaintance which came from (^Northamptan^) , and we
agreed to go to a Tavern together, I staid with
them some Time, and being at a Loss for a 
Horse to go my Journey, as I was to set out very
soon the next Morning, I went from the Tavern
to find out One Mr. (^Adams^) , who I knew had a
Horse would do for me, Mr. (^Adams^) was not at
Home, But was gone to (^Vauxhall^) , accordingly
having got directions where to find him, I went to
(^Vauxhall^) , where I saw Mr. (^Adams^) ; he gave me a 
Ticket for his Horse, and I took my leave of
him, thinking it to be my best Way to go cross
the Fields home to (^Camberwell^) , and accordingly
I went to (^Kennington^) Common, crossed over the
Road and went into the Fields.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] What Time was this?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] It was almost Nine, when I left
(^Vauxhall^) , and it was between Nine and Ten, when
I got into the Fields. When I got into the Third
Field I saw a Man before me in the Field, on my
right Hand, and presently two more.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Were they all three together?
<P 12>
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] Yes, my Lord, there is a Bar to
get over, after that I was over that, they
seperated, one went to my Left Hand, another to
my Right, and the third came after me; seeing
myself thus beset, I turn'd back to look, and
saw a Man coming towards me in a (^Brown Coat^) ,
a thin middle-sized Man: He came up to the
Bar, and leap'd over at once; he had a Pistol
in his Left Hand, and a large Oak Stick in his
other: After he had leap'd over the Bar, he
cry'd out, (^I want to speak with you^) ; and
immediately came up to me, and clapping a Pistol to
my Breast demanded my Money.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Were the other two Men near you,
when you were thus attack'd?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] One was about sixteen Yards off,
the other more.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] This Man that presented the Pistol to
you, was dress'd in Brown, you say: What were
the others dress'd in?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] In Brown, they were all dress'd in
Brown. After he had demanded my Money, I
told him, I had a Guinea and a Half, and that I
would give him; but not satisfied with that, he
laid on me with his Stick as hard as he could:
The first Blow that I receiv'd, was on the Left
Side of my Head; upon which, I rais'd my
Arm, and defended myself with my Cane: I
receiv'd six Blows on my Head and Left Arm,
and then he drew a back Stroke, and cut me just
under my (^Right Eye^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did not the two Men come up to you
all this While?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] No, my Lord, I found myself very
much bruised, and said to him, you Rascall, you
Villian You, are not you a Rascal to abuse a 
<P 13>
Gentleman, when he tells you what Money he has,
and offers to give it You? why did you STRICK
then? Said he, I could not well defend myself
any longer with my Cane, so I threw it down and
clos'd in with him, and in the Scuffle fell with
him, he then put his Hand in my Breeches 
Pocket, and took out One Guinea, a half Guinea, an
Iron Ring, a Bunch of small Keys and a Silver
Seal, and finding I had no more, (^What^) ! says
he, (^have you left your Money at London^) ? He then
demanded my Watch, and in the Warmth of my
Scuffle I was simple enough to let him understand 
that I knew him, for upon his demanding that, 
(^You Villian^) , says I, (^You know I wear none^) . When
he had robb'd me, he leap'd over the Bar again,
and went up to the two Men, and they all went
away together.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] You have told the Manner of your
being robb'd; Now, I would ask you, if you
were then certain that you knew the Man, and
by what?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] As soon as he came up to me I
knew him, for his Hat was flapp'd, and stood
a little on one Side, so that I saw his Face very
plain, and knew it perfectly well, tho' it had a
yellowish Cast round the Chin, as if it had been
rubb'd with something; besides I knew his
Voice.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Did you know the two others?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] No, I did not.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] You say, you knew the Person that
robb'd you. Look at the Prisoner: Now, 
consider the Oath you have taken, as you shall 
answer it to God, the Court, and your Country, is
the Prisoner the Man that robb'd you?
<P 14>
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] Upon the Oath I have taken, he is
the Man that robb'd me; I knew him the
Moment I saw him, and could not be mistaken.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] What did you do when he left you?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] I went directly Home.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] What Time was it when you come
Home?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] Between Nine and Ten, I sent for
Doctor (^Thompson^) , and he came to me and
dressed me, I told him I had been robb'd, the
Manner of it, and that I knew the Person. The next
Morning, which was (^Friday^) , I came to Town,
thinking to enquire his Name, and that I should
see him at the Tennis Court. I went to Justice
(^Frazier^) , and he would not grant me a Warrant;
so I went to the Tennis Court, and told the
whole Story to my Lord (^Cavendish^) , who advis'd
me to let the Warrant alone till the next Day;
because he was to be at the Tennis Court then at
Play: Accordingly, on the (^Saturday^) , having got
a Warrant from Colonel (^De Veil^) , I gave it to
(^North^) the Officer, and went with him to the
Tennis Court, where I pointed out the Prisoner
to him, and he took him, and carried him before
the Justice, where he was examin'd, and 
committed to the Gatehouse.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Did you see the Prisoner between the
Time of the Robbery being committed, and his
being apprehended?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] Yes, I saw him on the (^Friday^) at
the Tennis Court, and spoke to him, and he
seem'd to be very much confounded.
   [$ (^Council for the Prisoner.^) $] I would ask you a
Question or two, Sir, if you please. Did you
declare to Nobody that you did not know the
<P 15>
Man that robb'd you, and said, it was a
Soldier?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] I did say, he was (^Riding Master^) to
a Troop, and that I knew him, but not readily
knew his Name.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Have not you said, that you could
not swear to his Face, only to his Voice?
   [$ (^Wheatley.^) $] No, I always said, I knew both his
Face and Voice.
   [$ (^Council for the Prosecutor.^) $] Call (^Thomas Baker^) .
Mr. (^Baker^) , do you know any Thing of Mr. 
(^Wheatley's^) coming Home, on (^Thursday^) , the fifth
of (^June^) ? Give an Account of it?
   [$ (^Thomas Baker.^) $] I am a Tenant of Mr.
(^Wheatley's^) ; he came Home to (^Camberwell^) , between
Nine and Ten o'Clock on (^Thursday^) Night, the
fifth of (^June^) last; he was very much beat and
bruis'd, and said, he had been robb'd, and had
lost a Guinea and Half, and some other Things,
and that he had been very ill us'd, but he knew
the Man that did it?
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Did he say, who it was?
   [$ (^Baker.^) $] He said, that he knew him, but did
not mention his Name.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Did not he say, he was robb'd by
two Soldiers.
   [$ (^Baker.^) $] He said, the Man that had robb'd him
was a Soldier, and that he knew him very well.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Call Dr. (^Thompson^) . Mr. (^Thompson^)
was you sent for to Mr. (^Wheatley^) on the 5th of
(^June^) , what Time, and upon what Account.
   [$ (^Thompson.^) $] Between Nine and Ten o'Clock on 
the Fifth of (^June^) , I was sent for to Mr.
(^Wheatley^) , I live in (^Camberwell^) , I went to his House,
and dress'd him, he said he had been robb'd,
and that he believ'd he knew the Man.
<P 16>
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Did he mention no Particulars.
   [$ (^Thompson.^) $] Not while I staid, but I was not
there long.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] What Time was it when you was at
Mr. (^Wheatley's^) ?
   [$ (^Thompson.^) $] It was almost Ten o'Clock, but not
quite Ten.

   [$ (^Cou.^) $] Mr. (^John Baker^) , did you see Mr.
(^Wheatley^) any Time, and when since the fifth of (^June^) ,
did he mention any Thing about his being 
robbed, and what?
   [$ (^John Baker.^) $] I saw Mr. (^Wheatley^) on the
(^Friday^) , he said he had been robb'd, that he should
know the Man again if he met him; for he was
a Soldier, and he had given two Watermen
something to dog him who had seen him in
(^George's^) Fields.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Did he say, he knew the Man or
his Name.

again if he saw him, that was all.

I staid with him till almost Seven, when I was

accompany me; but as I was going another 
Way we parted, and he went towards the
(^Strand^) ,

Night, I wrote a Letter that Night, which makes
me remember the Date. I offer'd to give this in
before Colonel (^De Veil^) .
   [$ (^Council^) $] Did Mr. (^Greenwood^) send for you when

Frock and Breeches, and I took up the Flap to

   [$ (^Court.^) $] How do you know it was about 8 o'Clock.
   [$ (^Greenwood.^) $] We all guessed it to be about Eight.

you see the Prisoner Mr (^Greenwood^) there?
   [$ (^Dobb.^) $] I remember the Day very well, for I
wrote several Letters that Day: I was at the
(^Genoa Arms^) , and young Mr (^Greenwood^) came in
about a Quarter before 8 o'Clock: He sat down
by his Uncle, and they drank two Half Pints of 
Wine; while they were drinking, one of the
Company pull'd out some Patterns of Cloth,
which we look'd at, and I taking Notice of Mr
(^Greenwood's^) Coat, and talking of the Price of
Cloth, says he, What do you think the Outside
of this Coat and Breeches cost me? it was light
Fustian: Five or six and twenty Shillings said I.
No, said he, but sixteen.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] He had a light Fustian Coat on you
say?
   [$ (^Dobb.^) $] Yes, a light Fustian Coat and Breeches,
white Waistecoat and white Stockings. They
staid till a Quarter after 9, and then young
(^Greenwood^) would have had t'other half Pint, but the old
Gentleman said it was late, he must go Home.
<P 22> 
   [$ (^Court.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Conrt.^) ^] How do you know it  #
was a Quarter
after Nine? Had you any Clock, and did you look
particularly upon his going?
   [$ (^Dobb.^) $] No, my Lord, but the old Gentleman
saying it was late, one of the Company pull'd out
his Watch, and it was a Quarter after Nine all
but one Minute. They staid about three or four
Minutes in the House, and then got up and went
into the Yard, and there they stood talking a
Quarter of an Hour: From the Yard they went
down the Entry to the Street Door, and there
they stood again; they were Half an Hour in the
Yard, and at the Door.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you see them all the While?
   [$ (^Dobb.^) $] Yes, for I sate fronting the Window,
and saw them all the While they stood in the
Yard, and at the Door, and when they went
away I am sure it was above Half an Hour after
Nine.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Call Mr (^Turner^) . Do you
remember seeing Mr (^Greenwood^) on the 5th of (^June^) at
the (^Genoa Arms^) ?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Yes, Sir, I went into the (^Genoa Arms^)
about Half an Hour after Seven, and Mr
(^Greenwood^) came in not very long after me; so that I
believe it was near Eight: He staid there till past
Nine, and then ask'd his Uncle, old Mr 
(^Greenwood^) , if they should have another Half Pint, but
the old Gentleman did not care for any more
Wine; so they went out and stood talking
together in the Yard, and at the Door for near Half
an Hour, and then went away.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] What Cloaths had young Mr
(^Greenwood^) on at that Time?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] A white Fustian Frock, white
Waistcoat Breeches and Stockings.
<P 23>
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Did they stand in Sight when they
were in the Yard, and at the Door?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Yes, I saw them all the While.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Call Mr (^Sinicrose^) . Sir, Was you at
the (^Genoa Arms^) , on the 5th of (^June^) ?
   [$ (^Sinicrose.^) $] I was there about Seven o'Clock,
young Mr (^Greenwood^) came in about Eight; he
staid till a Quarter after Nine, and then went
out in the Yard, where he stood talking with his
Uncle Half an Hour, that is in the Yard and at
the Door.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Do you know any Thing of a Watch
being pull'd out to see the Hour.
   [$ (^Sinicrose.^) $] Yes, old Mr (^Greenwood^) saying it was
late, and he did not care to drink no more, I
pull'd out my Watch to see what o'Clock, and it
was exactly fourteen Minutes after Nine, they staid
some little Time in the House, paid their
Reckoning, and went and stood in the Yard and at
the Door.
   [$ (^Thomas Crose.^) $] I keep the (^Genoa Arms^) , young
Mr (^Greenwood^) was in the House when I came in,
about a Quarter after Eight, and I left him there
when I went out at Nine.
   [$ (^Alice Turner.^) $] I am Servant at the House where
Mr. (^Greenwood^) lodges in (^Conduit street^) ; he came
home on (^Thursday^) , the fifth of (^June^) , exactly at
11 o'Clock: I let him in, and I know what
Hour it was, because our Clock was set that Day,
and I look'd to see how it went, for one Clock
had struck, but ours had not.
   [$ (^John Greenwood.^) $] My Brother has Seventy
Pound a Year or upwards Estate part Freehold,
part Copyhold I know it for I received the Rents 
in my Father's Time, and for my Brother since
this Misfortune.
<P 24>
   [$ (^Lord Delawar.^) $] Mr. (^Greenwood^) is Riding
Master to the Troop, which I have the Honour
to command, it brings him in generally 200 (^l.
per Annum^) ; but, I believe, I may say never less
than 150. He is a sober Man, bears a general
good Character, and I never heard the least Ill
of him; this I know, that whenever I send for
him upon any Business, he is always ready and
with me, almost as soon as I send.
   [$Mr. (^Frazier.^) $] When Mr. (^Wheatley^) came to me
for a Warrant, he said he did not know the Man
by his Face, but by his Voice: I would not
grant him a Warrant, and said, if you cannot
swear to his Face, be sure you are certain of his 
Voice before you [^SOURCE TEXT: your^] swear.
   [$Col. (^De Veil.^) $] When he was examin'd before
me, Mr (^Wheatley^) said, if (^Greenwood^) was the Man,
he had a black Arm, for he had paid him so with
his Cane, that it must be black. He stripp'd
both his Arms, and not the least Mark
appeared; most of the Evidence that has been given in
Court was offer'd before me.
   [$My Lord (^Delawar^) , Col. (^Folliot^) , Capt. (^Hawker^) ,
Esq; (^Fowler^) , Mr (^Ellis^) , and several others
appeared, and gave Mr (^Greenwood^) a general good
Character.
   The Prosecutor likewise call'd several 
Gentlemen to his Character, who said, that he was a Man
that would not forswear himself on any Account.
   The Judge, having summ'd up the Evidence,
left it to Jury, concluding:$] (^Gentlemen, if you
believe Mr^) Wheatley (^you will find the Prisoner guilty,
if do not believe Mr.^) Wheatley (^you'l acquit him^) .
   [$The Jury withdrew, and return'd in a 
Quarter of an Hour, and brought in their Verdict,
NOT GUILTY.$]
