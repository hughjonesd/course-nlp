[^PEDRO SPEAKS.^]
And my opinion is, [$quoth he,$] forasmuch
as euerye thing sheweth nowe a certaine
<P A6V>
naturall amitie amongst themselues, yea,
the trees, sayeth (^Plinie^) , hath a naturall
instinct of friendship, the sweete flowers,
the pleasaunt herbes, declares the same
also, that we intreate somewhat of
friendship, and bicause no friendship, or amitie
is, or ought to be more deere, and surer,
than the loue of man and wyfe, let thys
treatise be thereof, wherein I woulde the
duetie of the married man to be discribed.
For the knowledge of duetie is the 
maintenance of friendship. [$All the companie
commended Maister (^Pedro^) for this
pleasant deuise, & the Lady (^Iulia^) standing vp,
sayd, that forsomuch, as the soueraignetie,
though not with hir will, was
committed vnto hir wyth consent of them all,$] and
due obedience promised, I like well, [$quoth 
shee,$] of thys which Mayster (^Pedro^) hath
alreadie deuised, touching friendship, and
duetie of the maried man. Wherefore, by
the same authoritie, which I haue
receyued, I commaunde you Sir, [$and turned
hir towardes Maister (^Pedro^) ,$] to performe
this charge, which you haue deuised of the
maried man, not for that I thinke you to
<P A7R>
be a better husbande, than any of the reast
here. But because we being yet wholy
ignorant in this kinde of pastimes, you
may, as the principall authour thereof,
instruct vs in the whole circumstance: and
againe, being so well languaged, as you
are, we shall haue good sporte, to heare
you interlarde our Countrie speeche with
some Spanishe trickes. [^...^]
[^PEDRO BEGINS HIS SPEECH ABOUT MARRIAGE WHICH HE CALLS THE FLOWER
OF FRIENDSHIP: HE GIVES A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF MARRIAGE IN ANCIENT
CULTURES: HE FINISHES WITH THE VENETIAN CUSTOM OF BUYING WIVES.^]
<P B1R>
[^---^] an vnhappie custome
was it, [$quoth the Lady (^Iulia^) ,$] & likely that
the (^Flower of Friendship^) was but
weaklye rooted betweene them of so slender
acquaintance, but I praye you tell vs, how
the indifferent sorte were maried, that
were neyther foule, nor fayre, but louely
browne. Mary, [$quoth he,$] for such amongst
the (^Venetians^) , there was no money either
giuen, or taken, but were maried for
naught. And so perchaunce, [$quoth a merie
gentleman, that stoode by, called Mayster
(^Gualter^) of Cawne,$] were some of the 
fairest, as they be sometimes nowe a dayes.
I haue also read, [$quoth Maister (^Pedro^) ,$]
that in Fraunce, the maydens did choose
their husbands in this sorte. The parents
called a number of yong men to a banket,
who~ they thought fittest, & him, to whom
the mayde gaue first water, by that signe
she chose for hir husband. In (^Mauritania^) ,
as sayeth (^Diodorus Siculus^) , there was
such store of women, y=t= euery man might
haue fiue wyfes, and no lesse than three,
which also after y=e= death of their husbands,
<P B1V>
within one moneth eyther wyllingly
buried themselues with him, or were
perforce executed by the lawe. In the Isles of
(^Canaria^) , there were contrariwise so
many men, and so fewe women, that euerie
wife might haue seuen husbandes, & could
not take lesse than fiue. But I trust, [$quoth
the Lady (^Aloisa^) ,$] that those men were not
so kinde harted, as to be buried with their
wyfes, as the women in that other
countrie were with their husbandes. I thinke
not, [$quoth Maister (^Pedro^) ,$] and I doubt
whether those women of (^Mauritania^)
coulde not haue beene contented to haue
taried behinde their husbandes, had there
beene no lawe to haue compelled them.
Tush [$quoth the Lady (^Iulia^) ,$] thys is farre
fro~ your matter. [^...^]
[^PEDRO CONTINUES WITH CHALDEANS AND GREEKS: HE CONCLUDES THAT LOVE 
IN MARRIAGE MUST BE GIVEN TIME TO GROW LITTLE BY LITTLE.^]
<P B4V>
[^...^] Why? [$quoth Maister (^Gualter^) ,$] shal 
a man choose his wyfe with his eares. To
choose with our eares [$quoth Maister 
(^Pedro^) ,$] is to enquire of hir vertues, & vices,
by report whereof you shall vnderstande
hir conditions, and qualities, good, & bad.
As for that [$quoth (^Gualter^) ,$] it booteth                       #
[^SOURCE TEXT: booteh^] not.
For the best of them all haue their faults,
and if she be vertuous, she will looke to
be so honored, that hir husband shall haue
the more a do to please hir. And I
remember, that a wise man, I knowe not hys
name, being enquired of a friende of hys,
with whome he should marry, aunswered,
that he had beene married foure sundrie
times, first with a fayre woman, who was
so prowde of hir bewtie, that he was faine
to please, and content hir, least she should
dishonour him, the seconde verie riche,
whose substance made hir so stately, that
he was forced lyke a slaue to obey hir, the
thirde was so vertuous, that he was glad
<P B5R>
to honor, and reuerence hir, to keepe hir
still in hir vertuous goodnesse, the last was
of good lineage, which so exalted hir
stomacke, that shee made him hir bondman.
Nowe choose, [$quoth he,$] which of these
foure thou canst best content thy self. You
haue made a fayre reason, [$quoth the Lady
(^Aloisa^) ,$] I neuer knewe that you were so
deepely learned before, [^---^]
[^PEDRO CONTINUES TO SPEAK ABOUT MARRIAGE GIVING EXAMPLES FROM THE
BIBLE AND THE CLASSICS: HE CONCLUDES BY SAYING THAT THERE ARE
MANY MORE INTERESTING EXAMPLES.^]
<P C1R>
[^...^] You haue yet
day ynough, [$quoth the Lady (^Iulia^) .$]
Wherfore we pray you to shewe vs some of those
examples for oure instruction. [^...^]
[^PEDRO CONTINUES WITH THE SAME: THERE ARE CERTAIN ACTIONS AND
METHODS THAT SHOULD BE USED TO ACHIEVE A HAPPY MARRIAGE. PEDRO
CALLS THESE ACTIONS "HERBS".^]
<P C2V>
[^...^] These be excellent herbes, [$quoth the
Lady (^Aloisa^) ,$] and rarely founde all in one
garden. Wherefore we pray you teach vs,
how we maye plant, and conserue them.
[^PEDRO CONTINUES: HE CONCLUDES WITH THE ISSUE OF WOMEN AND
SECRECY.^]
<P C4V>
[^...^] It is happie [$quoth
the Ladie (^Aloisa^) ,$] that some women haue
beene secret in times past. For you men say
nowe a dayes, that women can keepe no
counsaile. See I pray you, [$quoth Maister
(^Gualter^) ,$] how soone this Ladie, had gotten
holde of that sentence, which so little
serueth hir purpose. For I trust it was an
easie matter for that woman to keepe silence,
when shee wanted hir tongue. [^...^]
[^PEDRO CONTINUES ON THE SAME ISSUES.^]
<P C6V>
[^...^] I thanke you for this,
[$quoth Maister (^Gualter^) ,$] thys is the truest
tale, you tolde to daye, and hitherto, you
haue but flattered these Ladies. Not so,
[$quoth maister (^Pedro^) .$] For I spake nothing
heretofore but the truth, neyther speake I
this nowe generallye against all women.
For that were slaunderous vnto them. I
do but touch some shrewde wyues. Tushe,
[$quoth maister (^Gualter^) ,$] they bee shrewes
all, and if you giue the simplest of them
leaue to daye to treade vpon your foote, to
morrowe she will tread vpon thy head.
[^PEDRO CONTINUES: SOLON SENTENCED A FATHER TO BE DEPRIVED OF HIS
SEPULCHRE AFTER HIS DEATH BECAUSE OF HIS POOR UPBRINGING OF HIS SON:
THE SON WAS DISINHERITED FOR DISOBEDIENCE.^]
<P C8R>
[^...^] I assure you,
<P C8V>
[$quoth maister (^Lodouic^) ,$] that same was
an excellent iudgement of the wise (^Solon^) ,
and if it were put in vse at these dayes,
there woulde be many fathers to lye
wythout graues, and as many sonnes put from
their inheritance. The more pittie, [$quoth
mayster (^Pedro^) ,$] and I thought to haue
sayde more therein. But the sunne is so
much declined, that it is more then tyme
to vnburden these Ladies of this tedious
talke, and I feare me, I haue alreadye
troubled them to long. Not so, [$quoth the
Ladie (^Iulia^) .$] For sooner shoulde we want
the day light, than good will to brace you,
though the day were so long againe. You
say your pleasure, [$quoth mayster (^Pedro^) .$]
But nowe to knit vp this (^Flower^) of
matrimoniall amitie, and friendshippe,
touching the office of the man, I say, that hee
must aboue all thinges haue the feare of
God before his eyes, which with the rest
well considered, and put in execution, no
doubt hee shall enioye the flagrant fauour
thereof. [^...^]
[^THE COMPANY THANKS PEDRO FOR HIS TALK: JULIA WANTS TO HEAR MORE:
SHE GIVES HIM HER GARLAND.^]
<P D1R>
[^JULIA SPEAKS.^] [^...^] For I shall not bee in
quiet, [$quoth shee,$] till I haue hearde the
married woman prescribed in lyke sorte,
as you haue done the married man,
neyther can this (^Flower^) well prosper, or bee
perfite, except the woman also put to hir
helping hande. [$Whereto mayster (^Pedro^)
aunswered, that in the woman was to be
required great helpe for the preseruation
of this friendlye (^Flower^) .$] Yet will I not,
[$quoth hee,$] take the authoritie from you.
But if you list to departe with it to some
other, you shall your selfe to morrowe
resigne it to whome it pleaseth you, [^---^]
[^PEDRO TELLS JULIA TO LEAVE THE GARLAND: THE COMPANY DECIDES TO
MEET THE NEXT DAY.^]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P D2V>
[^ALOISA HAS ACCEPTED THE GARLAND AND NOW SPEAKS.^]
[^---^] [$quoth she,$] I will that the Ladie (^Iulia^)
doe briefely (for that the day is farre past)
discribe vnto vs, the office, and duetie of
the married woman, in lyke sort as
mayster (^Pedro^) hath done for y=e= mans behalfe,
<P D3R>
and therein to shew in what sort she must
applie hir selfe, to maintaine this (^Flower
of Friendship^) betweene hir husbande and
hir. [^...^]
[^AFTER SOME HESITATION THE LADY JULIA BEGINS HER SPEECH ABOUT
WOMEN'S DUTIES IN MARRIAGE: SHE DOES THIS IN THE SAME WAY AS
PEDRO DID, GIVING EXAMPLES FROM THE CLASSICS: SHE TURNS TO
GUALTER SAYING THAT THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WOMEN AS LOVING AS MEN:
GUALTER RESPONDS.^]
<P D7R>
[^...^] No doubt
Madam, [$quoth he,$] ye loue passingly, when yee
do loue, and you hate as extreemelye, when
yee doe hate. Wherefore it were a goodly
matter, if you coulde bring your married
women vnto a meane. Not so, [$quoth the
Lady (^Iulia^) ,$] I will haue no meane in loue.
[^JULIA CONTINUES: SHE COMES TO THE ISSUE OF OBEDIENCE.^]
<P D8R>
[^...^] I know not, [$quoth
the Lady (^Isabella^) ,$] what we are bounde to
do, but as meete is it, that the husbande
obey the wife, as the wife the husband, or at
the least that there bee no superioritye
betwene them, as the auncient philosophers
haue defended. For women haue soules as
wel as men, they haue wit as wel as men,
and more apte for procreation of children,
than men. What reason is it then, that
they should be bound, whome nature hath
made free? Naye, among the (^Achaians^) ,
wome~ had such soueraigntie, that
whatsoeuer they commaunded, their Husbandes
obeyed. Yea, (^Plutarch^) saith, that the man
swept the house, drest the meate, and did all
other necessaries, where the woman
gouerning the house, and keping the money,
aunswered all matters, and which woorse
was, they corrected them at their discretio~.
<P D8V>
What did shee, [$quoth Maister (^Gualter^) ,$]
& might she beate him too? Mary lo. Here
is the matter, that some of our Dames in
this Countrie take so much vppon them.
They think belike that they be in (^Achaia^) .
But sure if I had bene amongst those
women: you would haue done, [$quoth the Ladie 
(^Isabella^) [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Isablla^) ^] ,$] as they did. For Dogs #
barke
boldely at their owne maisters doore.
Beleue not daughter, [$quoth the Lady (^Iulia^) ,$]
neither those ignorant Philosophers, nor
these fonde customes. For contrary also to
this, the (^Parthians^) , & (^Thracians^)
accounted not of their wiues, more than of slaues,
so that after they had borne them a dosen
children, or more, they sold the mothers at
the common markets, or exchaunged them
for yonger. Fye vpon that law, [$quoth the
Lady (^Isabella^) .$] But what saye you to the
custome which (^Dionysius Alicarnasseus^) ,
wryteth of the (^Numidians^) and (^Lydians^) ,
where the woman commaunded within
doores, and the men without. Yea marie
[$quoth the Ladye (^Aloisa^) ,$] that was a iust
law, where the commau~ding was equall.
Not so, [$quoth the Lady (^Iulia^) .$] For though
<P E1R>
it were better than the other two: yet not
tollerable amongst vs, neyther was the
soueraignetie so equallye deuided, as you
thinke. For if the woma~ keepe alwaies hir
house, as duetie is, the man standeth euer
at hir comaundement. For as long as she
is within, though he commaund hir
without, this lawe byndeth hir not to obey.
Wherefore in my opinion al those
(^Barbarian^) customes are to be disanulled, and
co~temned of Christians. Ye say well,
Madam, [$quoth M. (^Erasmus^) .$] For in deede both
diuine, & humaine lawes, in our religion
giueth the man absolute authoritie, ouer
the woman in all places. And, [$quoth the
Lady (^Iulia^) ,$] as I sayde before, reason doth
confirme the same, the man being as he is,
most apt for the soueraignetie being in
gouernement, not onely skill, and experience
to be required, but also capacity to
comprehende, wisdome to vnderstand, strength to
execute, solicitude to prosecute, pacience to
suffer, meanes to sustaine, and aboue all
a great courage to accomplishe, all which
are commonly in a man, but in a woman
verye rare: Then what blame deserue
<P E1V>
those men that doe permit their wyues to
rule all, and suffer themselues to be
commaunded for company. A hard aduenture,
[$quoth Mayster (^Gualter^) ,$] hapneth to that
man, which is matched with a maisterly
shrew. For she being once past shame, not
onely blabbeth out all, that she knoweth,
but thundereth oute that also, which hir
mad head conceyueth, or hir fantasticall
braine dreameth of, and yet will she
maintaine, that she is neuer angrie, or speaketh
without great cause. [^...^]
[^JULIA CONTINUES: THE WOMAN MUST BE ABLE TO SEE THE MOOD OF HER 
HUSBAND BY THE LOOK ON HIS FACE.^]
<P E4V>
[^...^] Why, [$quoth
the Ladie (^Isabell^) ,$] what if he bee mad, or
dronke, must we then shew the like
countenance. If you perceiue him in such case,
[$quoth the Ladie (^Iulia^) ,$] speake him fayre,
and flatter him, till you get hym to bed.
and there reprehende him louingly, with
<P E5R>
kissing and imbrasing, that he maye
perceyue it to come of pure loue, more than
of malice, for better were it to conuert
him louingly in gentlenesse, than to
controle him frowardly in shrewdnesse. It is
most true, [$quoth M. (^Pedro^) .$] For in this
point, we are not muche vnlyke to wylde
and sauage beasts, as the lyon, or the
vnicorne, which by the force can not bee tamed,
but by humilitie, and gentle meanes, so
that who will reclayme vs, must auoyde
all contrarying, and veration of minde,
whereof I could tell you a pretie story, that
of late yeares happened to a gentlewoma~,
that by suche gentle wyles reclaymed hir
husband, being farre gone, but I shoulde
iniurie the Lady (^Iulia^) , to entermeddle so
farre in hir charge. Not so, [$quoth she,$] but
you shall greatly pleasure mee therein,
wherfore I pray you let vs heare it. [^...^]
[^PEDRO TELLS THE STORY OF THE WOMAN WHO RECLAIMED HER HUSBAND.^]
<P E6R>
[^...^] He should,
[$quoth the Ladie (^Aloisa^) ,$] haue had a bed of
nettles, or thornes, had it bene to mee. For
sure I would not haue beene the cherisher
of my husband in his vnthriftinesse. And
so should you haue made him worse, [$quoth
mayster (^Pedro^) .$]
[^THE DISCUSSION IS CONCLUDED: THE LADY ISABELLA ASKS THE AUTHOR
TO WRITE IT DOWN WITH THESE WORDS.^]
<P E7V>
For [$quoth she,$] your quiet silence both these
dayes, assureth mee, that you haue well
considered thereof, [$and therewith the reast 
of the ladies joyned with her, at whose 
importunate request, with the 
helpe of my friend Maister 
(^Pedro^) , and others, I
haue aduentured to
publishe this
Discourse.$]
