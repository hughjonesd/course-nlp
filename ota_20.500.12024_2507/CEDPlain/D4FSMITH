   [$Not long after the committing of
this Robbery, overtaking an old
Grasier on (^Putney-Heath^) , in a very ordinary
Attire, but yet very Rich, he takes
half a score Guineas out of his Pocket,
he gave them to the Old Man, and
said,$] (^There are three or four Persons
behind us, who look'd very suspicious,
therefore I desire the Favour of you to
put that Gold into your Pocket, for in case
they are Highway-Men, your indifferent
Apparel will make them believe you have
no such Charge about you^) . [$The Old
Grasier, looking upon his Intentions
to be honest, quoth he,$] (^I have fifty
Guineas ty'd up in the Fore-lappit of my Shirt,
and I'll put it to that, for Security^) . [$So 
riding along both of them Cheek by
Jole, for above half a Mile, and the
Coast being still clear, the (^Golden
Farmer^) said to the Old Man,$] (^I believe
<P 10>
here's no body will take the pains of
robbing you or me to Day, therefore I think I
had as good take the trouble upon me of
robbing you my self, so, instead of
delivering your Purse, pray give me the Lappit
of your Shirt^) . [$The Old Grasier was
horridly startled at these Words, and
began to beseech him not to be so
cruel in robbing a Poor Old Man.$]
(^Prithee^) [$ (quoth the (^Golden Farmer^) ) $] (^don't
tell me of Cruelty, for who can be more
Cruel than Men of your Age, whose Pride
it is to teach their Servants their Duties
with as much Cruelty, as some People teach
their Dogs to fetch and carry^) ? [$So, being
obliged to cut off the Lappit of the
Old Man's Shirt himself, for he would
not, he rid away to seek out for
another Booty.$]

   [$Another time this bold Robber lying
at the (^Red-Lyon-Inn^) in (^Uxbridge^) , he
happen'd into Company with one Esq;
(^Broughton^) , a Barrister of the
(^Middle-Temple^) , which he understanding, 
pretended to him, that he was going up
to (^London^) , to advise with a Lawyer
about some Business, wherefore he
should be much oblig'd to him if he
<P 11>
could recommend him to a good one. [^ABOVE, NO ITALICS FOR Inn 
IN THE SOURCE TEXT.^]
Counsellor (^Broughton^) , thinking he
might be a good Client, bespoke
him for himself; then the (^Golden
Farmer^) telling him his Business was about
several of his Neighbours Cattle
breaking into his Grounds, and doing
a great deal of Mischief, the Barrister
told him, that was very Actionable, as
being (^Damage fesant^) .$] (^Damage fesant^) !
[$said the (^Golden Farmer^) ,$] (^what's that, pray
Sir^) ? [$He told him, that it was an
Action brought against Persons, when
their Cattle broke thro' Hedges, or
other Fences, into Peoples Grounds,
and did them Damage. Next
Morning, as they were both riding
towards (^London^) , quoth the (^Golden Farmer^) ,
to the Barrister,$] (^If I may be so bold as
to ask you, pray Sir, what is that you call
Trover and Conversion^) ? [$He told him,
it signified, in our common Law, an
Action which a Man hath against one,
that having found any of his Goods,
refuses to deliver them upon Demand,
and perhaps converts them to his own
use also. The (^Golden Farmer^) being now
at a place convenient for his Purpose,
he reply'd,$] (^Very well, Sir; and so if I
<P 12>
should find any Money about you, and
convert it to my use, why then that is but
only Actionable, I find^) . (^That's a Robbery^) ,
[$ (said the Barrister) $] (^which requires no less
Satisfaction than a Man's Life^) . (^A
Robbery^) ! [$ (reply'd the (^Golden Farmer^) ) $] (^why
then I must e'en commit one, for once and
not use it, therefore deliver your Money,
or else behold this Pistoll shall presently 
prevent you from ever reading^) Cook upon
Littleton (^any more^) . [$The Barrister was
strangely surpriz'd at his Client's rough
Behaviour, asking him if he thought
there was neither Heaven nor Hell,
that he could be guilty of such wicked
Actions? Quoth the (^Golden Farmer^) ,$]
(^Why, you Son of a Whore, thy Impudence
is very great, to talk of Heaven and
Hell to me, when you think there's no way
to Heaven but thro'^) Westminster-Hall.
(^Come, come, down with your Rino this
Moment, for I have otherguess Customers
to mind, than to wait on your A--se all
Day.^) [$The Barrister being very loath
to part with his Money, he was still
insisting on the Injustice of the Action,
saying, that it was against both Law
and Conscience to Rob any Man.
However, the (^Golden Farmer^) heeding
<P 13>
not his Pleading, he swore that he
was not to be guided by Law nor
Conscience, any more than them of
his Profession, whose Law is always
furnish'd with a Commission to arraign
their Conscience; but upon Judgment
given, they usually had the knack of
setting it at large. So putting a Pistol
to the Barrister's Breast, he quietly
deliver'd his Money, amounting to
about thirty Guineas, and eleven
Broad-Pieces of Gold, besides some Silver,
and a Gold Watch.$]

   [$One time overtaking a Tinker, on
(^Black-Heath^) , whom he knew to have
seven or eight Pounds about him,
quoth he,$] (^Well overtook, honest Tinker,
methinks you seem very Devout, for your
Life is a continual Pilgrimage, and in
Humility you go almost barefoot, thereby
making Necessity a Vertue^) . Ay, Master,
[$ (reply'd the Tinker) $] needs must when
the Devil drives; and, had you no
more than I, you might go without
Boots and Shoes too. (^That may be^) ,
[$ (quoth the (^Golden Farmer^) ;) $] (^and I 
suppose you march all over^) England (^with your
Bag and Baggage^) . Yes, [$ (said the
<P 14>
Tinker) $] I go a great deal of Ground; but
not so much as you ride. (^Well^) [$ (quoth
the (^Golden Farmer^) ) $] (^go where you will, it
is my Opinion, your Conversation is 
unreprovable, because thou'rt ever mending^) .
I wish [$ (reply'd the Tinker) $] that I could
say as much by you. (^Why, you Dog of^)
Egypt [$ (quoth the other) $] (^you don't
think, I hope, that I'm like you, in
observing the Statutes, and therefore had
rather Steal than Beg, in spite of Whips or
Imprisonment^) . [$ (Said the Tinker again) $]
I'll have you to know, that I take a
great deal of Pains for a Livelihood.
(^Yes^) [$ (reply'd the (^Golden Farmer^) ) $] (^I know
thou'rt such a strong Enemy to Idleness,
that in mending one Hole, you make three,
rather than want Work^) . That's as you
say, [$ (quoth the Tinker) $] however I wish 
that you and I, Sir, were farther
asunder, for i'faith I don't like your
Company. (^Nor I yours^) [$ (said the other) $]
(^for tho' thou'rt entertain'd in every place,
yet you enter no farther than the Door, to
avoid Suspicion^) . Indeed [$ (reply'd the
Tinker) $] I have a great Suspicion of
you. (^Have you so^) ? [$ (quoth the (^Golden
Farmer^) ) $] (^why then it shall not be without a
Cause; come, open your Wallet strait, and
<P 15>
deliver that Parcel of Money that's in it^) .
[$Here their Dialogue being on a 
Conclusion, the Tinker pray'd heartily
that he would not robb him, for if he
did, he must be forc'd to beg his way
home, from whence he was above an
Hundred Miles.$] (^D--n me^) [$ (quoth the
(^Golden Farmer^) ) $] (^I don't care if you Beg
your way Two-hundred Miles, for if a
Tinker 'scapes^) Tyburn (^and^) Banbury, (^it
is his Fate to die a Beggar^) . [$So taking
Money and Wallet too, from the
Tinker, he left him to his old Custom of
conversing still in open Fields and 
lowly Cottages.$]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 20>
   [$One time (^Old-Mobb^) overtaking the 
Stage-Coach going for (^Bath^) , and in
which was only one Gentlewoman, he
commanded the Coachman to stop his
Horses; and then demanding the
Passenger's Money, she made a great
many Excuses for not answering his
Expectation, and, to raise Pity in him,
she shed Tears very plentifully, and
cry'd she was a poor Widow, who
had lately lost her Husband, and
therefore hop'd he would have some
Compassion on her.$] (^D--n me, you B--ch^) ,
[$quoth (^Old-Mobb^) ) $] (^and your Husband too; 
the loss of him is no Argument that I must
lose my Booty. Come, come, Deliver 
quickly, for those Crocadile Tears of thine work
no Pity in me, because I know the end of
a Woman's Husband always begins in Tears,
and the end of her Tears begins in another
Husband^) . Indeed [$ (said the 
Gentlewoman) $] my late Husband was so very
good to me, that I shall never think
<P 21>
of Marrying another, because I shall
not find the like of him again, for
Kindness. [$Quoth (^Old-Mobb^) then,$] (^Hold
your Tongue, you lying B--ch, for at that
rate you'll differ from all other Widows,
who are just like an Herauld's Herse-Cloth;
they'll serve to many Funerals with a very
little altering the Colour: So talk no more
of the Dead to me, for I must live by the
Quick^) . [$The Gentlewoman, finding
she could receive no Civility at his
Hands, she gave him her Purse, in
which was about forty Guineas;
(^Old-Mobb^) putting it into his Pocket, quoth
he,$] (^I should have made a narrower Search
about your Person, but that I see another
Prize coming forwards^) . [$Whereupon,
making up to it, who should it be, but
(^Cornelius a` Tilburgh^) , the Mountebank
living in (^Lincolns-Inn-Fields^) , going to 
set up a Stage at (^Wells^) . Then, giving
his usual Word of Command to him,
he craved his Money, but in a very
rough sort of Language, which made
the Quacksalver to use several
Expostulations for the saving of what he
had; but all to no purpose, for
(^Old-Mobb^) , knowing his Profession, quoth
he,$] (^As you get your Money very easy, I
<P 22>
must oblige you to observe the old Proverb^) ,
Lightly come, lightly go; (^therefore what
you do, do quickly, that I may go about
my Business^) . [$The Stroling Doctor being
very unwilling to part with his Money,
he began to read a Lecture to him,
about the Unlawfulness of his Actions,
and withal, telling him, that what he
did might be the utter Ruine of some
People.$] (^Why, you double-refin'd Son of a
Whore^) , [$ (quoth (^Old-Mobb^) ) $] (^can I ruine more
People than you? Who hath put out more Eyes
than the Small-Pox; made more Deaf than
the Cataracts of^) Nile; (^Lam'd more than
the Gout; Shrunk more Sinews than one
that makes Bow-strings; and Kill'd more
than the Pestilence. Therefore make haste
and Deliver, or else I'll make you to know,
that tho' your^) Orvietan (^will expel Poyson,
yet is it not Proof enough against the Force
of Gun-powder, which, by the vertue of a
little Lead, shall fill your Body as full of
holes as a Sieve^) . [$Whereupon, rifling his
Portmantua, he took thereout 
twenty-five Pounds, and a Gold Medal, 
presented him by King (^Charles^) the Second,
for poysoning himself in His Majesty's
Presence.$]

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 27>
   [$Another time (^Old Mobb^) being at
(^Abingdon^) , where a great Market is kept
for Corn, he lit into a Person's 
Company, at the (^Crown-Inn^) there, whom
he knew to be a great Ingrosser of
Corn, and had bought then as much of
that Commodity in the Market as cost
Fifty Pounds, which (^Old Mobb^) bought
of him again, and paid him Eighty 
Pounds ready Money, as liking it (as
he pretended) better than any he saw
there that Day. The Corn he sent
presently away, where he knew how 
to dispose of it quickly again, tho'
under Price; and understanding which
way he went the next Morning, of
whom he bought the Corn, he was
soon at his Heels, and clapping a Pistol
to his Breast, demanded his Money
again, and what else he had besides.
The Countryman was in a great
<P 28>
Surprize, shaking like an (^Aspen-Leaf^)                             #
[^NO ITALICS FOR Leaf IN SOURCE TEXT^] , and
ask'd him whether it was Justice to
take his Money from him, and Goods
too?$] (^Hast thou the Impudence^) [$ (quoth
(^Old-Mobb^) ) $] (^to talk of Justice, when there's
none in the World acts more Injustice than
an Ingrosser of Corn? Sirrah, there's no
Vermin in the Land like you, who slanders
both Heaven and Earth with pretended
Dearths, when there's no Scarcity at all.
Thou Spawn of^) Belzebub! (^you daily pray
for more Inclosures, and know no reason
why we call our Forefathers Days^) , The
Time of Ignorance, (^but only because
they sold Wheat for Twelve-pence a Bushel.
Thou Fiend of Hell! Don't you wish^)
Dantzick (^at^) Barbadoes? (^And curse 
Tobacco because you say it is a sparer of
Breadcorn, which you too often transport without
a License? No Picture pleases you so well
as^) Pharaoh's (^Dream of the seven lean kine,
that eat up the fat ones; that you'll have
in your Parlour, and commend it to People,
with a smother'd Prayer for the like
Scarcity. Besides, accounting the Poor the
Justices Intelligencers, you mortally hate them,
and complain of our Negligence of
discovering new parts of the World, only to rid
them from our Climate. So Mr. Hell-bound,
<P 29>
talk no more of Justice, but deliver your
Money strait, or else I'll send a Brace of
Balls thro' your Head^) . [$Hereupon he
deliver'd him a Bag, in which (^Old-Mobb^)
finding his own Money, and as much
more to it, he went away with a great
deal of Satisfaction.$]

<S SAMPLE 4>
<P 98>
   [$Now (^Holloway^) having cast all
Honesty and Goodness quite out of doors,
he was resolv'd to prosecute his Villany
to the highest Degree; so from
committing small Matters of Theft, he
was resolv'd to turn Highwayman, and
being accoutred for this Purpose, as
having a good Horse, Hanger and
Pistols, he set out for such Enterprizes.
The first Action he went upon was
upon the Road betwixt (^Faringdon^) and
(^Abingdon^) in (^Berkshire^) , where meeting
with a Country Farmer, and asking
him the time of the Day, he told him
it was about twelve a Clock;$] (^Why then^)
[$ (quoth (^Holloway^) ) $] (^it may be about high
time to ask one Favour of you^) . What's
that? [$ (said the Farmer.) $] (^Why truly^)
[$reply'd (^Holloway^) $] (^understanding that you
<P 99>
receiv'd Ten Pounds at the Inn from whence
you now came, for I was drinking in the
next Room when 'twas paid you, Necessity
obliges me to borrow it, therefore if you are
not willing to lend it me by fair Means,
you must by foul Means^) . [$The Farmer
being a Man of some Courage, 
presently drew his Hanger in his own
Defence, but that being no security
against Pistols, which could kill at a 
Distance, (^Holloway^) shot his Horse
under him, so dismounting his
Antagonist, and riding up to him with
another Pistol ready cockt, and 
presenting it to the Farmer's Breast, he lent
him his Money without taking a Note
of his Hand for't.$]

   [$Another time (^Holloway^) meeting with
a Gentleman on the Road, who had
like to have been robb'd but a little
before, he told the said (^Holloway^) , as
supposing him to be an honest Man, that
there were some Highway-men before,
wherefore he advis'd him, if he had
any Charge about him, to turn back.
Quoth (^Holloway^) ,$] (^I have no great Charge
about me, Sir, however I'll take your
Advice for fear of the worst^) . [$So as they
<P 100>
were riding along, said (^Holloway^) again,$]
(^Perhaps we may meet with more Rogues of
the Gang by the way, for this is an ugly
robbing Road, therefore I'll secure that
little I have, which is but three Guineas, by
putting it in my Mouth^) . [$Now the
Gentleman thinking him not of that
Profession, quoth he,$] (^And in case we
should be set upon, I have secur'd my
Gold in the Rowls of my Stockings, which
is no small Quantity, which I receiv'd this
Day of some of my Tenants for Rent^) .
[$They had not gone above half a Mile
farther, e'er they came into a very
bye place, where (^Holloway^) bidding the
Gentleman Stand and Deliver, he was
in a great Surprize,$] [^---^]

<S SAMPLE 5>
<P 105>
[^...^] [$About a Month after, (^Dick
Adams^) having been Drinking somewhat
hard in the City, and forgetting the
Prank he had plaid the Mercer, he
came by his House one Afternoon, and
he being accidentally standing at the
Door, and espying his Chapman, he
presently seiz'd him, saying,$] (^Oh! Sir,
have I caught you; you are a fine Spark
indeed to cheat me out of Two-hundred
Pounds worth of Goods, but before I part
with you, I believe I shall make you pay
dearly for them^) . [$Indeed Mr. (^Adams^)
was much surpriz'd at his being so
suddenly apprehended, and without
doubt, curs'd his Fate to himself for
being so forgetful as to come into the
very Mouth of his Adversary; but
seeing the late Bishop of (^London^) at some
Distance riding along in his Coach,
and having a good Presence of Mind
<P 106>
at the same time, quoth he to the
Mercer,$] (^I must acknowledge I have committed
a Crime to which I was forc'd by meer
Necessity, but I see my Uncle the Bishop of^)
London (^is coming this way in his Coach,
therefore hoping you'll be so civil as not to
raise any hubbub of the Mob about me,
whereby I shall be expos'd and utterly undone,
I'll go speak to His Lordship about the 
matter, if you please to step with me, and I'll
engage he shall make you Satisfaction for
the Damage I've done you^) . [$The Mercer
liking his Proposal, as thinking it far
better than sending him to Jayl, he
stept along with Mr. (^Adams^) , who
boldly calling out to the (^Coachman^) to stop,
he approached the side of the Coach,
and desir'd the Favour of speaking a
few Words with the Bishop. His
Lordship seeing him have the Mein and
Habit much of a Gentleman, he was
pleas'd to hear what he had to say; so
leaning over his Coach Door, quoth$]
(^Adams, Begging your Lordship's Pardon for
my Presumption I make bold to acquaint
Your Honour, that the Gentleman standing
behind me is an eminent Mercer, keeping
House just by here, and is a very upright
Godly Man; but being a great Reader in
<P 107>
Books of Divinity, especially Polemical
Pieces, he hath met therein with some
intricate Cases which very much trouble him,
and his Conscience cannot be at rest, 'till
his Doubts and Scruples are clear'd about
'em; therefore I humbly request Your
Lordship would vouchsafe me the Honour
of giving my Friend some Ease before he
run farther to Despair^) . [$The Bishop 
being ready to serve any Person in
Religious Matters, he order'd (^Adams^) to
bring his Friend to him the next Day.
But said (^Adams^) again,$] (^It will be more 
satisfactory to him, if Your Lordship would
be pleas'd to speak Yourself to the 
Gentleman to wait upon You^) . [$Whereupon His
Lordship beckoning to the Mercer,
who stood some Distance off, whilst
they discours'd together; when he
came up to the side of the Coach,
quoth the Bishop,$] (^The Gentleman hath
inform'd me of all the matter about you,
and if you please to give your self the
Trouble of coming to Morrow to my House
at^) Fulham, (^I'll satisfy you then in
every Point^) . [$The Mercer making
twenty Bows and Cringes was very well
pleas'd with his Security; and taking
(^Adams^) to the Tavern gave him a very
<P 108>
good Treat. Next Morning (^Adams^)
came again to the Mercer, who was
drawing out his Bill to give to the
Bishop, and pretending that his coming
in haste to go along with him to his
Uncle, had made him forget to put 
Money in his Breeches, he desir'd the
Mercer to lend him a Guinea, and put
it down in his Bill; which he did
very willingly; and then taking Water,
away they went to (^Fulham^) , where
acquainting the Bishop's Gentleman, that
according to his Lordship's Order over
Night they were come to wait upon
him at the time appointed; the
Gentleman introduc'd 'em into the Hall,
and having Regal'd them there with a
Bottle or two of Wine and a Neat's
Tongue, the Mercer was admitted 
into His Lordship's Presence, and in the
mean time Mr. (^Adams^) made the best
of his way by Water again. Now
the Mercer being before the Bishop,
quoth His Lordship,$] (^I understand that
you are, or at leastwise have been much
troubled, how do you find yourself now,
Sir^) ? [$The Mercer reply'd,$] (^My Trouble
is much abated since Your Lordship was
pleas'd to order me to wait on you^) . [$So
<P 109>
pulling out a Pocket Book, he gave
his Lordship the following Bill.$]
[^THE BILL IS OMITTED.^]
<P 110>
   [$His Lordship staring upon this large
Bill, quoth he,$] (^What's the meaning of
all this? The Gentleman last Night might
very well say your Conscience could not be
at rest; and I think so too, when you bring
a Bill to me which I know nothing of^) .
[$Said the Mercer then, Bowing and
Scraping,$] (^Your Lordship last Night was
pleas'd to say that you would satisfy me to
Day^) . (^Yes^) [$ (reply'd his Lordship) $] (^and so
I would as to what the Gentleman told me,
who said that you being much troubled about 
some Points of Religion, you desired to be
resolv'd therein; and in order thereto I
appointed you to come to me to Day^) . (^Truly^)
[$ (said the Mercer again) $] (^Your Lordship's
Nephew told me otherwise, for he said you
would pay me this Bill off, which Goods,
upon my word, he had of me, and in a very
clandestine manner, if I was to tell Your
Lordship all; but only in respect to Your
Honour, I would not disgrace your Nephew^) .
[$Quoth His Lordship,$] (^My Nephew! he's
none of my Nephew; I never, to my 
knowledge, saw the Gentleman in my Life
before^) . [$Thus when they came to 
unriddle the matter on both sides they could
not forbear laughing, the Bishop at
his new Nephew, and the Mercer for
<P 111>
lending a Man, that had once cheated
him, a Guinea to cheat him again.$]

<S SAMPLE 6>
<P 122>
   [$Another time (^Jack Ovet^) being 
drinking at the (^Star-Inn^) in the (^Strand^) , he
over-heard a Soap-boiler contriving
with a Carrier how he should send an
hundred Pounds to a Friend in the
Country; at length it was concluded
upon, to put the Money into a Barrel
of Soap; which Project was mightily
approv'd of by the Carrier; who said,
(^That^) $] (^if any Rogues should rob my Waggon,
which they never did but once, the Devil
must be in 'em if they look for any Money
in the Soap-Barrel^) . [$Accordingly the
Money and Soap was brought to the
Inn; and next Morning the Carrier
going out of Town, (^Jack Ovet^) was
<P 123>
with him in the Afternoon, and 
commanding him to stop, or other wise he
would shoot him and his Horses too,
he was oblig'd to obey the Word of
Command. Then, quoth the honest
Highwayman,$] (^I must make bold to
borrow a little Money out of your Waggon,
therefore if you have any direct me to it,
that I may not loose my Time, which you
know is always precious^) . [$The Carrier
told him he had nothing but
cumbersome Goods in his Waggon, as he knew
of; however, if he would not believe
him, he might search every Box and
Bundle there if he pleas'd. Then (^Jack
Ovet^) getting into the Waggon, threw
all the Boxes and Bundles about, till at
last he came to the Soap Barrel which
feeling somewhat heavy, quoth he to
the Carrier,$] (^What a Pox do you with this
nasty Commodity in your Waggon? I'll [^SOURCE TEXT: I ll^] fling
it away^) . [$So throwing it on the Ground
the Hoops bursted, out flew the Head,
and the Soap spreading abroad, the 
Bag appear'd; then jumping out of the
Waggon, and taking it up, he said
again,$] (^Is not he that sells this Soap a
cheating Son of a Whore, to put this Bag of Lead
into it, to make the Barrel weigh heavy? If
<P 124>
I knew where he liv'd, I'd go and tell him
his own; however that he may not succeed
in his Roguery, I'll go and sell it at the next
House I come to, for it will wet ones
Whistle, to the Tune of two or three Shillings^) .
[$So riding away, quoth the Carrier,$]
(^Hold, hold, Sir, that is not Lead that is
in the Bag; it is an hundred Pounds, for
which (if you take it away) I must be
accountable^) . (^No, no^) , [$ (reply'd (^Jack Ovet^) $]
(^this can't be Money; but if it is, tell the
Owner that I'll be answerable for it if he'll
come to me^) . (^Where, Sir^) , [$ (said the
Carrier) $] (^may one find you^) ? (^Why, truly^) ,
[$ (reply'd (^Jack^) ) $] (^that is a Question soon asked,
but not so soon to be answered; for i'faith,
you may find me in a Goal before Night, and
then perhaps you may have again what I've
took from you, and forty Pounds to boot; so
hoping you'll use, for the future, Wash Balls
instead of Soap, I'm oblig'd to bid you
farewel, because I must now go somewhere else
to make Hay while the Sun shines^) .

   [$Another time (^Jack Ovet^) meeting
with the (^Worcester^) Stage Coach on the
Road, in which were several young
Gentlewomen, he robb'd them all;
but one of them being a very
<P 125>
handsome Person, he seem'd to have such
a Passion for her exquisite Charms,
that when he took her Money from
her, he said,$] (^Madam, cast not your Eyes
down, neither colour your Face with those
modest Blushes, since it would appear most
admirable, that your Virtues should find
Fetters in a Place where they expect
Conquest. What I have took from you (through
meer Necessity at present) is only borrowed;
for as there is no Object on Earth can
allure my wavering Eye at your Venus-like
[^NO ITALICS FOR Venus IN SOURCE TEXT^]
Beauty, assure yourself that if you please
to tell me where I may direct to you, and
I'll [^SOURCE TEXT: I ll^] upon Honour make good your Loss to
the very utmost^) . [$The young
Gentlewoman told him where he might send
to her;$] [^---^]

<S SAMPLE 7>
<P 131>
   [$Another time (^Will Bew^) and his
Brother overtaking a very handsome
Gentlewoman and her Footman on
the Road, he bore up to her; and
pretending to be much enamour'd
with her Beauty, they held the 
following Dialogue.$]
   [$Will Bew.$] (^Madam, by those killing
Features of your charming Face, give a
Gentleman leave, for once, to say, he's
your humble Servant.^) 
   [$ (^Gentlewoman.^) $] Indeed, Sir, you
honour me so much, that I have not the
Vanity to think my self worthy of
such Servants.
   [$Will Bew.$] (^I vow, Madam, the very
Image of your Countenance, and outward
Expressions of your Behaviour, make my
passionate Desires to think that the
Enjoyment of your Person is a Favour [^SOURCE TEXT: Favonr^] much more
to be valu'd than any thing in this Life.^) 
   [$ (^Gentlewoman.^) $] I thank you, Sir, for
your good Opinion of me; but 'tis an
old as well as true Saying, (^That hot
Love is soon cold^) ; and therefore you 
must pardon my Rudeness, telling you,
whosoever reads the Records of the
faithless Protestations of Men, their
perjur'd Promises, and feign'd Love,
<P 132>
cannot but view a poor (^Ariadne^) abus'd,
a (^Medea^) mockt, and a (^Dido^) slighted.
   [$Will Bew.$] (^There's no general Rule,
Madam, without an Exception, therefore
as all our Sex are not to be blam'd for some
particular Persons, grant me then the
Happiness, who will be ever constant, of
having my true Affections rais'd to the honour
of waiting upon your Commands, who even
exceeds^) Venus (^herself for Beauty^) .
   [$ (^Gentlewoman.^) $] Truly, Sir, you
mistake my Disposition, if you suppose
I affect Praises.
   [$Will Bew.$] (^I speak as I mean,
Madam; and must say, that Tragedians and
Painters are not guilty of those Murders
which the Darts of your Eyes must needs
commit daily; wherefore in all Shapes, and
under the most dreadful Aspects that can
appear, I am intirely Yours for ever.^) 
   [$ (^Gentlewoman.^) $] But I shall not say I
am yours, because you seem to be the
Emblem of Terror; and your furious
Looks are able to consume a Woman.
   [$Will Bew.$] (^As a Pledge of my
Protestation, you shall have both my Hand and
Heart to be yours in Dust and Ashes.^) 
   [$ (^Gentlewoman.^) $] It would appear
boldness in me to accept of Strangers
<P 133>
Company; for it is not for me to
entertain all Shews and Offers of
Kindness; however I can but thank you
for your good Will.
   [$Will Bew.$] (^Indeed, Madam, you, who
have Power to infuse Love and Fidelity 
into the Hearts of^) Barbarians, (^have
captivated me, who never was in Love before^) .
   [$ (^Gentlewoman.^) $] If you would be more
thrifty of your Breath, you may spend
it to better purpose; for you may
intimate your Desires, and make tedious
Discourses, but, in a Word, I shall
never love you.
   [$This flat Denial being given in a
convenient place to commit a (^Robbery,
Will Bew^) quickly chang'd his Note, by
turning his Complements into Railery,
saying,$] (^Tho' I flatter'd you just now, yet
have you no more Beauty than will serve to
excuse you from being extream ugly: And
if you still persist to doat on your seeming
handsomness, the time will come when your
Face will scare you more than a Judge doth
a Criminal. So Madam deliver what you
have^) . [^...^]

<S SAMPLE 8>
<P 228>
   [$Another Time this pickled Blade
being upon his Patrole in (^Essex^) , as he was
on one side of the Hedge, he espy'd at
some Distance, a Gentleman very well
mounted on a good Gelding; so getting
into the Road, he lay all along on
the Ground with his Ear close to it,
'till the Gentleman came up; who
asking him the Reason of that Posture,
(^Stephen^) held up his Hand to him, which
was as much as to bid the Gentleman
be silent; but the Gentleman being of
a hasty Temper, quoth he,$] (^What a Pox
are you listening to^) ? [$Hereupon (^Stephen^)
sitting on his Breech, he said,$] (^Oh!
dear Sir, I have often heard great Talk of^)
Fairies, (^but I could never have the Faith
to believe there were any such Thing in
Nature, 'till now; for indeed, here in this
very Place I hear such a most ravishing and
melodious Harmony of all sorts of Musick,
which was enough to charm me to sit here,
if possible, to all Eternity^) . [$This Story
<P 229>
made the Gentleman presently alight
to hear this ravishing Musick too; so
giving (^Stephen^) his Guelding to hold, and
laying his Ear to the Ground, quoth
he,$] (^I can hear nothing^) . [$Mr. (^Bunce^) bid
him turn t'other Ear; so his Face being
from him, he presently mounted his
Gelding, and gallop'd away with all
Speed, 'till he came within Sight of
(^Rumford^) , then alighting, he let the
Gelding loose, supposing that if the
Owner us'd any Inn in that Town, he
would make to it, as accordingly he
did, and (^Stephen^) at his Heels, which 
made the Hostler, who was at the Door,
cry out,$] (^Master, Master, here's Mr.^)
Bartlet's (^Horse come without him^) : [$So
(^Stephen^) by this Stratagem having got
the Owner's Name, quoth he to the
Inn-keeper, (^Mr.^) Bartlet (^being engag'd with
some Gentlemen in Play at^) Ingerstone, (^he
pray'd him to send him 15 Guineas, and to
keep his Gelding in Pledge thereof 'till he
came himself, which would be in the
Evening^) .$] (^Aye, aye^) , [$ (reply'd the Inn-keeper) $]
100 (^Guineas if he wanted 'em^) ; [$so giving
(^Stephen^) 15 Guineas, he made the best of
his Way to (^London^) , when in about four
or five Hours, the Gentleman came
<P 230>
puffing and blowing in his great
Jack-Boots to the Inn, and the Inn-keeper
stepping up to him, he said,$] (^O, dear
Sir, what need you have sent your Gelding,
and so put your self to the Trouble of
coming this sultry Weather on Foot, for the
small Matter of 15 Guineas, when you might
have commanded ten times as much without
a Pledge^) ? [$Quoth the Gentleman,$] (^Hath
the Fellow then brought my Gelding hither?
A Son of a Whore! He was pretty honest
in that; but I find the Rogue hath made
me pay 15 Guineas for hearing his d--n'd
Faries Musick^) .

<S SAMPLE 9>
<P 268>
   [$Another Time (^Jack Hall^) going to
one Mr. (^Aspin^) , a Robe-Maker, living
in (^Portugal-Street^) by (^Lincolns-Inn^) back
Gate, he pretended that he had
Occasion for a Gown for his Brother, who was
a Parson in the Country, but he
would have a very good one, though
it cost him the more Money.$] (^I can
furnish you with all Sorts and Sizes^) , [$said
Mr. (^Aspin^) ; and thereupon fetch'd 
several, and shew'd him. (^Jack^) turn'd
many of them over, but still desir'd to
see better; at length one was brought,
which he seem'd to like; but said he to
the Robe-maker,$] (^I doubt it is too short?
No^) , [$ (quoth he) $] (^it is long enough in all
Conscience^) ; [$and thereupon he was for
trying of it upon (^Jack^) , who said,$] (^Alas!
that will be no certain Measure by me, for
my Brother is taller than I am by the Head
and Shoulders; but as he is a Man about
your Pitch, I desire the Favour of you to
put it upon your self, and then I shall guess
the better whether it is long enough, or no^) .
[$Mr. (^Aspin^) , to satisfy his Customer, did
<P 269>
so; but as he was putting it on, (^Jack^)
took up a Barrister's Gown, and shew'd
him a fair Pair of Heels. Mr. (^Aspin^) ,
without putting off the Gown, pursu'd
him; in the mean Time two of his
Companions, who laid Perdue, acted 
their Parts, for (^Stephen Bunce^) went 
into the Shop, and taking the next
Parcel of Goods which came to Hand, he
march'd off; and (^Dick Low^) fearing
that if the Shop-keeper kept his Pace,
he might overtake (^Jack Hall^) , he
having plac'd himself in the Way on
purpose, catches hold on Mr. (^Aspin^) ,
and says,$] (^O! dear Doctor^) Cross, (^who
thought of seeing you? I am glad I have
met you with all my Heart: But pray, Sir,
what makes you run in this distracted 
Manner about the Streets^) ? (^Pish^) , [$ (quoth Mr.
(^Aspin^) ) $] (^let me go, I'm no Parson, you are
mistaken in the Man, for I'm running after
a Rogue that has robb'd me^) . [$Then (^Dick
Low^) reply'd, but still holding him,$] (^I
beg your Pardon, Sir, for my Mistake, for 
you are as like my Friend Doctor^) Cross,
(^as ever I saw two Men in my Life like one
another^) . [$So letting him go, (^Jack^)
before now was turn'd the Corner of a
Street or two, and was quite out of
<P 270>
Sight. By this Time also several of
the Neighbours being gather'd 
together, they were in an Admiration to
see old (^Aspin^) in a canonical Habit, some
saying, (^Surely he was not going to christen
his own Child himself, which his Maid^) 
Betty (^lay in with^) ! whilst others perswaded
him to go Home, and put off the Gown,
and then make an Enquiry after the
Thief, since he was at present got
clear away. Mr. (^Aspin^) took their 
Advice; but when he came to his Shop,
he found a second Loss, which made
him more angry than before, and
swear, that the Fellow that met him,
might well call him Doctor (^Cross^) , for,
d--n him, if he had not all the Crosses
in the World come upon him at once.$]
