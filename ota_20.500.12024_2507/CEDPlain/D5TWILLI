<P 6>
   [$The Prisoner address'd himself to the Court;$] Gentlemen,
I must confess, this is a very heavy and severe Charge; but,
I hope, it is not all Fact that is alledged against me. -- I shall
not take up much time, but leave it to the Court.
   [$The President said,$] Sir, you may depend upon it the Court 
will do you Justice. -- [$The Prisoner answered,$] I am sure 
they will.
   [$Capt. (^Timothy Neucella^) , late Lieutenant of the             #
(^Marlborough^) ,
was called in, in support of the Charge. Being sworn, his
Deposition was read, setting forth, That he was 2d 
Lieutenant of the (^Marlborough^) , on the 11th of (^February^) ,    #
1743,                                                               
which Ship was stationed as the second a-stern of Admiral
(^Mathews^) : That in the Morning, Admiral (^Mathews^) made 
the Signal for the Line of Battle a-head -- That Capt. 
(^Williams^) then commanded the (^Royal-Oak^) ; and that she was in
View of the Signal; and that the Combined Fleet was then 
about two or three Miles distant from the Center of his 
Majesty's Fleet -- That about eleven the Signal was made to
engage; and about one, the (^Namur^) and (^Marlborough^) bore
down and engaged the (^Real^) , and her Second a-stern; and 
that the (^Rupert^) and (^Royal-Oak^) did not bear down so near as
the (^Namur^) and (^Marlborough^) did, nor near enough to be 
within Point-Blank; and that from the Beginning of the 
Engagement, till five in the Afternoon, the (^Rupert^) and           # 
(^Royal-Oak^)                                                       
were to Windward of the Line; that the (^Royal-Oak^) was
further to Leeward, in the beginning, than any of the other
Ships; and that there were no Ships for the (^Rupert^) and 
(^Royal-Oak^) properly to engage. -- That a great many Guns were
fired by the (^Rupert^) and (^Royal-Oak^) , at too great a Distance;
that the (^Namur^) and (^Marlborough^) , were hard press'd by the 
Enemy; the (^Marlborough^) had her Main and Mizen Masts
shot away; that the (^Rupert^) and (^Royal-Oak^) were in Sight of
the (^Marlborough's^) Distress, and capable of yielding her 
Assistance; but neither of them bore down to assist her. That
about four the (^Ann-Galley^) Fireship bore down, and was not
covered by any of the other Ships; and that the (^Rupert^) and 
(^Royal-Oak^) might have done that Service, if their Commanders
had thought proper.$]
   [$ (^Then the Court asked.) ^) $] [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the            #
(^Royal-Oak^) in the Line,
when the (^Namur^) began to engage?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I can't tell; I did not see her then; when I saw her,
she made a small Angle with us.
<P 7>
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Where was you quartered?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Upon the lower Gun-Deck.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) to Leeward of the three other  #
Ships 
a-stern? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Time did you see her?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Once before she came down.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you ever see the (^Royal-Oak^) engage?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I saw her fire some Guns; but I think not within the 
Reach of Point-Blank, she was at too great a Distance.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] In the first Part of the Engagement, was there any
Ship for the (^Royal-Oak^) to engage with?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The five sternmost Ships were not come up: they did
not come up till two or three Hours after the Beginning.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Ship could she then engage with?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The 2d or 3d Ship a-stern of the (^Spanish^) Admiral.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Ships were a-stern of the (^Spanish^) Admiral?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Six. Five at a great Distance.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Number were in a Line with the (^Spanish^) 
Admiral? [$ (^A.^) $] Only one.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] When you saw the (^Royal-Oak^) fire, what Ship did she
fire at? [$ (^A.^) $] The 2d or 3d Ship from the (^Spanish^) Admiral.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was it in the latter Part of the Engagement?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, two Hours after we began; she might fire before
that; and I believe she did.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was she in a Line with the Admiral, when you first
saw her? [$ (^A.^) $] She was a little upon our Weather Quarter.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was she in a Line with the Admiral, at his first 
engaging? [$ (^A.^) $] I did not see her.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) ever in a Line with you?       #
[$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was you in a Line with the Admiral at first?
   [$ (^A.^) $] When we first brought to, the Admiral was as near in
a Line as could be; he was rather upon our Weather-Bow.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] When you saw the (^Royal-Oak^) , was it in her power #
to 
engage closely?
   [$ (^A.^) $] She must have gone to Leeward of the other Ships if
she had.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Could the (^Royal-Oak^) have engaged any Ships closely 
without going to Leeward of the (^Marlborough^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] If she had bore down in a Line with us at the first, #
he
might afterwards have engaged properly with the other (^Spanish^)
Ships that were coming up.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] When the (^Royal-Oak^) engaged, was it in her power to
have engaged in a Line with you? [$ (^A.^) $] I believe she might.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was you in a proper Line with the Admiral?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, as exactly as could be.
<P 8>
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was it in the Power of the (^Royal-Oak^) to give the 
(^Marlborough^) any Assistance?
   [$ (^A.^) $] If she had crouded a-head, she might have lain upon
our Quarter, and given us Assistance.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How far was the (^Royal-Oak^) from you, when you first 
lost your Masts?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I saw her a little after we lost our Masts; and she  #
was
then a Mile and half from us.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Could you see what Sail she had set?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I could, but did not observe.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you see any Number of Shot from the (^Royal-Oak^) 
fall short? [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How do you know she was not within Point-Blank?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I judge only by the Distance of the Ships, and she did
not appear to be near enough.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] At what Distance was the (^Royal-Oak^) from the      #
Ship she 
might have engaged?
   [$ (^A.^) $] If she had made proper Sail, and shot a-head those   #
Ships
between her and us, she might have given us the proper 
Assistance by engaging the (^Hercules^) .
   [$ (^Q.^) $] At what Distance was the (^Royal-Oak^) from you, when 
you saw her? [$ (^A.^) $] A Mile and half, or two Miles.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was there any Wind then? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was there enough for a Ship to answer her Helm?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did she never edge down after you first saw her?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I did not see that she did, till after the Admiral   #
wore.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did she appear to be at Windward or to Leeward of the 
three Ships between you and her?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I think she appeared to Leeward of the three; she was 
a Mile and half from us, and a-stern with all.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How much upon your Quarter? [$ (^A.^) $] Two Points.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How many Points was the Admiral upon your Bow?
   [$ (^A.^) $] One Point.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Which of the four Ships a-stern then appeared to be 
most in a Line with the Admiral?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The (^Royal-Oak^) was the Leewardmost of all, she was
almost in the Line.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) never nearer you than a Mile   #
and half?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I believe not till they all bore away -- but I 
cannot be exact as to the Distance.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you see the (^Royal-Oak^) how she engaged?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I did not see her engaged till after the Wearing.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How long did you see the (^Royal-Oak^) in the whole?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Two Hours and a half from the first I saw her.
<P 9>
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you never see her out of your Stern Ports?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, before we lost our Masts.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How near was the (^Royal-Oak^) to the second a-stern #
of the 
(^Spanish^) Admiral then. [$ (^A.^) $] Half a Mile, or something less.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Ship did she fire at?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I believe it was at the (^Hercules^) ; but I could   #
not see
plainly.
   [$ (^Then the Prisoner asked.) ^) $] [$ (^Q.^) $] Did not the     #
(^Royal-Oak^) go to 
Leeward of you before the Wearing?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Not to my Knowledge, but I can't say she was not.
   [$Then the Prisoner said,$] It is a remarkable thing, because
you gave us three Cheers.
   [$Then the Witness said,$] I do remember it now Captain
(^Williams^) mentions it, that he was then to Leeward of us just
after our Masts were gone: It was before we wore; but I
had forgot it.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was it before the Wearing? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^The Court asked.) ^) $] [$ (^Q.^) $] Had the (^Real^) bore   #
away then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Are you positive it was after the (^Real^) bore away?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I think she was bore away.
   [$Then the Prisoner said,$] there is a Gentleman just come to 
Town, that was a Lieutenant in the (^Marlborough^) ; and if 
Capt. (^Neucella^) does not remember it, perhaps he may.
   [$The Court said he should be called presently.$]
   [$Then the Judge Advocate told the Court, that 
Lieutenant (^Hale^) , of the (^Marlborough^) , was just come home,   #
and if
the Court pleased, he might be called. And he came into
Court accordingly.$]
[$Lieutenant (^Hale^) came into Court, and was sworn.$]
   [$ (^The Court asked.) ^) $] [$ (^Q.^) $] Where was you quartered?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Upon the middle Gun-Deck.
   [$The court desired him to relate what he knew relating to
the (^Royal-Oak^) .$]
   [$ (^Witness said^) ,$] I know very little of her at the beginning.
Soon after the Admiral ordered us to bear down; I went down
to my Quarters, when our Masts were gone I went upon
Deck, then I saw the (^Royal-Oak^) to Leeward of the rest of our
Ships a-stern of the (^Marlborough^) .
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was this after your Masts were gone? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Is that all you know? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Distance was she from you then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] She was upon our Weather Quarter, about half a Mile
from us then.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How near was the Enemies Ships?
<P 10>
   [$ (^A.^) $] Within Point-blank of those Ships a-stern of us, that 
were coming up.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Which of 'em did she fire at? [$ (^A.^) $] The Head  #
most.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Within Point-blank? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How long did she engage her?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot tell, they were firing before I came upon   #
Deck.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How long did she engage from the Time you saw her.
   [$ (^A.^) $] Three Quarters of an Hour, after the Time I saw her.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What made her leave off? 
   [$ (^A.^) $] She was engaging when I left the Ship, and went on 
Board of the Admiral, I did not observe what she was doing
after that.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] When you first observed the (^Royal-Oak^) , how many 
Ships were between you and her?
   [$ (^A.^) $] There were Three between us, there were some of 'em
further off than the (^Royal-Oak^) : The (^Essex^) was further off.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) to Leeward of all those Ships?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, she was to Leeward of all the Four Sail.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Then there was hardly Room for the other Ships, if she
was within half a Mile of you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The others were further to Windward.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) , when you saw her, as far to  #
Leeward 
as the Admiral, when she began to engage?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I think she was.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you ever observe any Signals, besides that for the
Line of Battle, and that to engage, after your Masts were 
gone?
   [$ (^A.^) $] There was a Signal in the Morning for the 
Vice-Admiral to make more Sail; and after our Masts were gone, the
Signal for Battle was haul'd down, and a white Flag was 
hoisted at the Fore-Topmast head, and a Gun was fired.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] When was this?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It was when I went to seek for the Frigates to       #
assist us.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Time of the Day was it?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It was about Sun-sett; it was after we wore.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you ever see the (^Royal-Oak^) to Leeward of your 
Ship? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say I did.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Do you remember her being cheer'd by you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No: I was not on Board then.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] When you saw her; what Position was the Enemy 
from her? 
   [$ (^A.^) $] Some of 'em were a-stern upon her Quarter, and two 
Shot abreast of her.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How near was the (^Royal-Oak^) then to the Enemy?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Those which she fired at, she was within Gun-shot of: 
I saw their Shot go over her.
<P 11>
   [$ (^Q.^) $] If the (^Royal-Oak^) had gone nearer, when you saw   #
her,
must not she have broke the Line?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes: She must have been to Leeward of us; and to
Leeward of the Line.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How was the Admiral from you then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Upon our Weather-bow.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How much upon your Weather-bow?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Two Points.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] At what distance? [$ (^A.^) $] Half a Mile.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How long did the (^Royal-Oak^) , engage within 
Point-blank, before the Admiral wore?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I was gone before the Admiral wore: she was then     #
engaging.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How long was you cheer'd at first by the             #
(^Royal-Oak^) ,                 
before the Engagement began?
   [$ (^A.^) $] An Hour and half, or Two Hours.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How long did you see the (^Royal-Oak^) engaging?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I am very sure Three Quarters of an Hour.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was she near enough to do sufficient Execution?
   [$ (^A.^) $] She was within Point-blank, I saw the Shot from the 
Enemy go over her.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What distance was she from the Ship she engaged?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I do not remember how many Cables length: I believe
Three Quarters of a Mile; I saw the Shot go over her.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Why do you think she was within Point-blank?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Because I saw the Shot go over her.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did any Shot from the Enemy fall short of her?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No: I never did see any.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was you engaging then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The (^Real^) was then upon our Bow, and we could not
bring our Guns to bear upon her.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Where was the (^Namur^) then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] To Windward of us, engaging the (^Real^) .
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What was the (^Hercules^) doing then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Hercules was firing at us, and we at her: but    #
could
not bring our Guns to bear upon the (^Real^) .
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you receive much Damage from the (^Hercules^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I believe most of the Damage we received, was from the 
(^Hercules^) .
   [$Then (^Juan Baptista^) , Pilot of the (^Marlborough^) , was     #
called 
in. His Deposition read, setting forth, that he was 
Pilot of the (^Marlborough^) , the Ship stationed next a-stern of 
the Admiral, on the (^11th^) [^NO ITALICS FOR NUMBER 11 IN SOURCE    #
TEXT^] of (^February^) , 1743. That
about Nine or Ten the Signals was made, for the Line of
Battle, a-head: That the (^Rupert^) , was in sight of the 
Signal, that about Half an Hour past Ten, the Signal was
made to engage, and that about One, the (^Namur^) and 
<P 12> 
(^Marlborough^) bore down, and engaged the (^Real^) , and her
Second a-stern. That at the beginning, and during the
whole Engagement, the (^Rupert^) and (^Royal-Oak^) were out 
of Point-Blank. That the (^Marlborough^) was disabled,
having her Main and Mizen Masts shot away; and that 
the (^Essex^) , (^Rupert^) , and (^Royal-Oak^) were capable of giving
her Assistance, but did not. That the (^Anne-Galley^) Fireship 
bore down between 3 and 4; and that the (^Essex^) , 
(^Rupert^) , and (^Royal-Oak^) might have covered her. That if
any of the four Ships a-stern of the (^Marlborough^) had bore
down to succour her, they might have done it, and 
might have stopped the sternmost of the (^Spanish^) Ships
from getting a-head, till the Vice-Admiral, and his 
Division, could have got up.$]
   [$ (^Then the Court asked.) ^) $] [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you ever see   #
the (^Royal-Oak^) 
engage the Enemy?
   [$ (^A.^) $] After we had done engaging, I saw a Ship more to
Leeward, than any of the others a-stern, and believe it was 
the (^Royal-Oak^) hailed us, cheered us, and came to Leeward 
of us.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) then within Point-Blank?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Shot fell short of her at first.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) within Point-Blank before you  #
lost
your Masts?
   [$ (^A,^) $] I cannot tell whether she was within Point-Blank.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How near was the (^Royal-Oak^) at the nearest?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Within half a Mile.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you see the (^Royal-Oak^) fire after you lost your 
Masts? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] If the (^Royal-Oak^) had bore down, and engaged the  #
four
Ships of the Enemy that were coming up closely, would not 
she have been to Leeward of the Line?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, because those Ships were to Leeward of the      #
(^Real^) .
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was she near enough to do Execution?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, in the latter Part of the Action, after we had
done engaging.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did she make all the Sail she could from her first 
coming into the Fleet? [$ (^A.^) $] She was in the Line.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Could the (^Royal-Oak^) have bore down sooner than she
did? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, all the ships a-stern of us might.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Ship could she have engaged then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The (^Hercules^) , or the headmost of the four Ships #
that 
were coming up.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Distance was the headmost of the (^Spanish^)    #
Ships
from the (^Royal-Oak^) then? 
<P 13>
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say she was not far from them; if she had
bore away she might have attacked them, or the Ship a-stern
the (^Spanish^) Admiral that plagued us.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What distance was the headmost of the four (^Spanish^)
Ships coming up from you at the beginning?
   [$ (^A.^) $] At a great distance, 2 Miles and half a-stern, and   #
to
Leeward upon our Lee-Quarter.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Distance was the (^Royal-Oak^) then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] She was sternmost of the four that were a-stern of us.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) within Gun-shot of the Enemy
then? [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Could she have gone within Gun-shot without going to
Leeward of the Line?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, if she had bore down with us she might.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Distance was the (^Royal-Oak^) from you, when she
engaged? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot tell exactly.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Ship was nearest you, when you lost your Masts?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The two middle Ships were.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you, when you lost your Masts, look at the 
Admiral? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Where was he then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Till we lost our Masts, he was to the South-East upon
our Weather-Bow.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you observe any Signal the Admiral had out then,
besides that for the Line of Battle, and to engage? [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Could the (^Royal-Oak^) have given you any Succour, if
she had bore down properly. [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Could she have bore down?
   [$ (^A.^) $] There was Wind enough for them all to come up.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) in her Station at the beginning?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] If all the four Ships had bore down, would the       #
(^Spanish^)
Ships coming up have weathered them?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, I believe not.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How long were you engaged before you saw the 
(^Royal-Oak^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I saw her just after we had lost our Masts.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did she fire before that? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot tell.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you see any Ships she could have fired at?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No. After our Masts were gone I could not see any
Ships.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How long did the (^Royal-Oak^) engage?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I don't know.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did the (^Royal-Oak^) escape within Point-Blank of the
Enemy?
<P 14>
   [$ (^A.^) $] Their Shot could reach one another very well.
   [$Then Lieutenant (^Hide^) , of the (^Marlborough^) , was called in
and sworn, and asked by the Court.$]
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Where was you quartered?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Upon the upper Deck.
   [$Then his Deposition was read, setting forth, That,
between 9 and 10, the Signal was made for the Line of
Battle a-head; that about 1, the Admiral and 
(^Marlborough^) bore down and engaged; soon after the 
(^Marlborough^) was disabled, the (^Namur^) and (^Norfolk^) were then
engaged with the Enemy; that the (^Rupert^) and the 
(^Royal-Oak^) , might have assisted the (^Marlborough^) , but did not;
that the (^Ann-Galley^) Fireship bore down, and that the
(^Rupert^) and (^Royal-Oak^) might have cover'd her, but did
not.$]
   [$ (^Then the Court asked.) ^) $] [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the            #
(^Royal-Oak^) within Point-Blank?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot tell all the Ships a-stern of us were to 
Windward.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was it ever in the (^Royal-Oak's^) power to have     #
engaged
the Enemy. [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Where was the (^Royal-Oak^) when you began to engage?
   [$ (^A.^) $] They were all to Windward. I did not mind her 
particularly.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How many of our Ships were a-stern of you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The (^Dorsetshire^) , (^Essex^) , (^Rupert^) , and   #
(^Royal-Oak^) .
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Might any of them have bore down and engaged as well
as you? 
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say there was Wind enough.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Could not they then have bore down?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I think they might.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you ever see the (^Royal-Oak^) engaged with the 
Enemy? [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) firing when you saw her?
   [$ (^A.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Q.^) ^] I never saw her fire.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How far was the (^Royal-Oak^) from the               #
(^Marlborough^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say.
   [$ (^Humphry^) St. (^Hill^) , Mate of the (^Marlborough^) , was   #
called in,
and sworn, the Court asked:$]
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Where was you quartered?
   [$ (^A.^) $] At the Braces forwards.
   [$Then his Deposition was read, setting forth, That on the 
11th of (^February^) 1743, he was Mate of the 
(^Marlborough^) : That in the Morning a Signal was made for the
Line of Battle a-head: That Captain (^Williams^) commanded
<P 15> 
the (^Royal-Oak^) , and Captain (^Ambrose^) the 
(^Rupert^) ; that the Combined Fleet was about three or four
Miles Distance from our Centre, when the said Signal
was made; that about 11 the Signal was made to engage,
and about 1 the (^Namur^) and (^Marlborough^) bore down
and engaged the (^Real^) and (^Hercules^) ; that the (^Rupert^) and
(^Royal-Oak^) bore down, but not so near as they ought to
have done, as there was Wind enough.$]
   [$ (^Then the Court asked.) ^) $] [$ (^Q.^) $] What Ship could    #
the (^Royal-Oak^)  
have engaged, if she had bore down in your Wake?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The second, the headmost of the 5 Sail a-stern of the
(^Spanish^) Admiral.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was she within Gun-shot at first? [$ (^A.^) $] I     #
think not.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] If the (^Royal-Oak^) had bore down in your Wake, could 
she have assisted you against the (^Hercules^) . [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you receive any Damage from the (^Hercules^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, a good deal.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Therefore, if the (^Royal-Oak^) had bore down, she   #
might
have assisted? [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you see the (^Royal-Oak^) engage? [$ (^A.^) $]   #
Yes.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] At what Distance? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] After your Masts were gone, could she have gone 
nearer without breaking the Line?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I believe not; the four Ships a-stern would have     #
fetch'd
into the (^Marlborough's^) Wake.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was she in a Line with you? [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did the Admiral haul off first?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Admiral said to our Captain, Do you bear down,
and I will follow you. -- The Admiral fired a Quarter-Deck
Shot, and after half an Hour the Admiral hauled his Wind,
and broke the Line.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Distance was the (^Royal-Oak^) from you at the  #
first 
beginning? [$ (^A.^) $] Two or three Miles.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] How far was the headmost of the (^Spanish^) Ships    #
from you
then? [$ (^A.^) $] Two or three Miles.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Was the (^Royal-Oak^) the Leewardmost of the four    #
Ships
a-stern of you? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you ever observe any Signal made by the Admiral
after the (^Marlborough's^) Masts were gone, besides the Signal to
engage? [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Do you think the (^Royal-Oak^) was within Point-Blank
when she fired? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you see any Shot fly over her?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, I saw her Smoke.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you observe how long she engaged? [$ (^A.^) $] No.
<P 16>
   [$ (^Q.^) $] When you saw her Smoke, was she at the proper 
Distance to engage the Enemy?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, I cannot say, but I think not.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Whether was the (^Royal-Oak^) or the (^Rupert^) at   #
the greatest
Distance? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you never see the (^Royal-Oak^) engaging properly?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Did the (^Royal-Oak^) go to Leeward of you after your
Masts were gone? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Do you remember any thing of any Cheers from the
(^Royal-Oak^) ? [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] When you lost your Masts, which of the four Ships 
a-stern was nearest you? [$ (^A.^) $] The (^Dorsetshire^) .
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Time of the Day did you see the (^Royal-Oak^)   #
fire?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It was after two, and after our masts were gone;
when the Masts went away, I saw two Ships a-stern fire at 
the Ships coming up, and I looked out to see which, and 
believe it was the (^Royal-Oak^) and (^Rupert^) .
   [$ (^Q.^) $] What Time did you see the (^Royal-Oak^) last?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Never after that Time.
   [$ (^Then the Prisoner asked.) ^) $] [$ (^Q.^) $] Did you see the #
(^Dorsetshire^) ,
(^Essex^) , or (^Rupert^) firing at the Time you say I could have come
down?
   [$ (^A.^) $] About two I saw the (^Dorsetshire^) , and believe    #
you were 
firing.
   [$ (^Q.^) $] If I had gone down, should not I have gone through
their Fire? [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot say.
