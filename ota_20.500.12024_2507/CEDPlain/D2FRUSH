[}A PLEASANT HISTORY, HOW A DEUILL
(NAMED RUSH) CAME TO A RELIGIOUS 
HOUSE, TO SEEKE A SERUICE.}]
[^THE PRINCE OF DEVILS SO DESIRED THAT A CERTAIN CLOISTER OF
RELIGIOUS MEN CONTINUE THEIR EXTRAVAGANT LIFESTYLES THAT HE
SENT ONE OF HIS OWN TO LIVE AMONG THEM.^]
<P A2V>
[^...^] [$Then within a while after the Priour 
came vnto the gate and espied (^Rush^) the young man standing 
there all alone. Anon he said vnto him,$] what dost thou here,
and what wouldest thou haue. [$The young man with great
reuerence answered and said:$] Sir, I am a poore young man,
and am out of seruice, and faine would haue a Maister. And
Sir if it please you to haue me, I shall doe you diligent seruice,
and shall doe so well that you and all your brethren and couent
shall be glad of me, for I shall keepe so well your secrets, that
I trust to obtaine at all times your good loue and fauour, and
all theirs also.
   [$And when the Priour had heard his words, he was mooued
with pittie, and said:$] Goe into the Kitchin to the Cooke, and
shew him that I haue sent thee thither, and bid him show thee
what thou shalt doe: for thou shalt be with him a certaine
season, till that some other better thing fall. [$Then the young man
made his reuerence to the Priour, and thanked him, and foorth
he went to the Kitchin, where hee found the maister Cooke.
Anon he made reuerence vnto him, and said:$] Sir, my Maister
the Priour hath sent me hither vnto you, and he commaundeth
you to shew me what I shall doe, for I must be here and helpe
you. [$The maister Cooke answered and said,$] you be welcome.
[$And anon hee set him to such businesse as he had to doe. And
thus the Deuill became vnder-Cooke in the place that he was
assigned vnto, by the Prince of Deuils.$] [^...^]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P A3R>
[}THESE BEING THE WORDS OF THE DEUILL.}]
[^RUSH INTENDS TO CAUSE DISCORD AMONG THE FRIARS.^]
   [$Then within foure or fiue dayes after, it fortuned that the
Priour came into the Kitchin, and there he found the young
man, to whom he said,$] where wast thou borne, and what is
thy name? [$The young man answered and said,$] Sir, I was
borne very farre hence, and (^Rush^) is my name. [$Then said the
Priour vnto him,$] (^Rush^) , canst thou couple Hounds together?
Yea Sir [$ (said (^Rush^) ) $] that I can doe right well, and more   #
then
that, for I can couple men and women together, which is a
more mastrie, and also Sir (if neede be) I can conuay a faire
woman into your chamber, and conuay her home againe in
the morning so secretly, that no man shall spye it. And also
I shall keepe your counsaile so secretly, that it shall neuer be
knowne. [$And when the Priour heard (^Rush^) speake so, he was
right glad of him, and said:$] (^Rush^) , if thou canst doe as thou
hast said? I shall reward thee well for thy labour, and thou
shalt be my most welbeloued seruant: wherefore make an end
<P A3V>
of thy businesse, for soone, thou shalt goe a little way on a
message for me, [$and so he departed and went to supper. And when
euery man had supped, and (^Rush^) had done all his businesse in
the Kitchin, hee came vnto his maister the Priour, and said,$]
Sir, what is your will with me? [$the Priour answered and
said:$] here a little beside dwelleth a faire Gentlewoman, the
the which I loue very well, but I dare not discouer my minde
vnto her my selfe: and if thou canst finde the meanes to bring
her secretly vnto me, I shall reward thee right well for thy
labour and paine. [$And when (^Rush^) had heard the words of his
Maister, and knew all his minde, he answered and said:$] Sir,
be of good cheere, and let mee alone with that matter: for I
shall goe vnto the Gentlewomans house, and I shall say your
message so well, that this night she shall come to you: [$and so
departed (^Rush^) from his Maister, and went straight vnto this
Gentlewomans house. And when he was thither come, hee
found the Gentlewoman sitting all alone. And when (^Rush^)
was espied of her, he made vnto her great courtesie, and with
many reuerences these words he said.$]

[}HOW A DEUILL NAMED (^RUSH^) CAME VNTO A GENTLEWOMANS HOUSE,
AND HOW HE BROUGHT HER PRIUILY VNTO HIS
MAISTERS CHAMBER.}]

   Rest you merry faire Mistresse, the most fairest creature
in the world. My Maister greeteth you by me, desiring
you to come and speake with him. [$Then said the 
Gentlewoman to (^Rush^) ,$] who is your Maister, and what is his     #
will with
me? faire Mistresse, [$said (^Rush^) ,$] I will shew you, my Maister 
is the Priour in a house of Religion here beside, and he loueth
you so well except that you come vnto him this night, I know
he will be dead for sorrow.

[}HERE FOLLOWETH THE ANSWERE OF THE GENTLEWOMAN.}]

   [$And when the Gentlewoman had heard the words of
(^Rush^) , shee answered and said,$] Faire Sir, it were great
<P A4R>
pittie that the Gentleman should die for my sake, and rather
then he should so doe for me, I will come to him, and shew him
all the courtesie that I can. [$ (^Rush^) was very glad of those
comfortable words, and thought that his enterprise was well
brought to passe, and he said vnto her:$] Faire Mistresse, may
it please you to take the labour and goe with me, and I shall
bring you to my
Master, and as I 
suppose, hee will make
you good cheare, and
Gold and Siluer you
shall lacke none, for
hee hath great plenty
thereof. [$Then saide
the Gentlewoman,$]
Sir, I pray you let
vs depart hence: for 
as I suppose the
Gentleman looketh
long for vs. [$So foorth
they went both 
together, till they came to
the Priours 
Chamber.$] [^...^]
[^THE OTHER FRIARS SOON ASKED RUSH TO HELP THEM IN THE SAME
WAY AS HE HAD HELPED THE PRIOR, WHICH HE DID. ALL WERE 
EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO RUSH, AND NONE GUESSED THAT HE WAS 
REALLY A DEVIL.^] 

<P A4V>
[}HOW FRIER (^RUSH^) THREW THE MAISTER COOKE INTO A KETTELL
OF WATER SEETHING VPON THE FIRE,
WHEREIN HE DIED.}]

   [$It befell vpon a day that (^Rush^) went forth to sport him, and
it was very late ere he came home againe, and the maister
Cooke was very angry with him that hee was so long absent.
And as soone as (^Rush^) was entred into the Kitchin: the Cooke
began to chide, and said vnto him,$] thou horson knaue where
hast thou beene so long: [$and with a great staffe hee laid vpon
(^Rush^) and beat him sore. And when (^Rush^) saw that the Cooke
was angry, and so farre out of reason, and that he had beaten
him sore: anon he began to waxe very angry with the maister
Cooke, and said vnto him:$] thou horson villaine, why hast thou
beaten me thus: I will be reuenged on thee: [$and suddainly he
<P B1R>
caught him in his armes, and threw him into a great kettell
which was full of water seething vpon the fire, and said,$] lye
thou there in the Diuels name: for now thou shalt neither
fight nor chide no more with me: [^---^]
[^RUSH THEN WENT TO COLLECT THE PRIOR'S MISTRESS. ON HIS RETURN, 
HE LEARNED THAT THE COOK'S BODY HAD BEEN DISCOVERED; EVERYONE  
HAD ASSUMED THAT THE COOK HAD DROWNED HIMSELF, AND RUSH WAS NOW 
THE NEW MASTER COOK.^]
<P B1V>
[^...^] [$Then 
it fortuned vpon a day the Priour and his brethren were
assembled together in a generall counsaile, and as they stood
talking together, the Priour remembred (^Rush^) , and anon he said
vnto his brethren:$] Friends we haue here (^Rush^) which is our
maister Cooke in our Kithin, and he is an olde seruant, and
much diligent and true seruice he hath done to vs, and he hath
continued among vs longer then any seruant that euer wee
had: wherefore me thinke it reason, that hee were promoted
vnto some other office, and made a brother among vs. [$Then
all the whole couent with one voice said they were content it
should so be. So the Priour sent for (^Rush^) , and when he was
come before him and all his brethren, the Priour said,$] (^Rush^) it
is so, thou hast beene here a long season and we haue found thee
hitherto a true and diligent seruant, wherefore wee will that
thou be promoted, and take vpon thee an habite as we haue,
and to become a brother among vs. [$ (^Rush^) answered and said:$]
my Maisters I thanke you all, [$and then the Priour gaue (^Rush^)
an habite, and put it on his backe, and so (^Rush^) became a
brother in the place, neuerthelesse he kept his office still.$]

[}HOW FRIER (^RUSH^) MADE TRUNCHEONS FOR THE FRIERS
TO FIGHT WITHALL.}]

   [$When (^Rush^) had on the habite of a Frier, and was a
brother in the place, he had more vacation dayes then
he had before. And as a King or a great Prince prepareth 
ordinances against their warres, in likewise did Frier (^Rush^) :
for when all his businesse was done in the Kitchin, and that he
had leysure, he went and sate in the Port of the vtter gate, and
there he was making of good bigge Truncheons of Oke. And
<P B2R>
he made them with Hilts ouer the hand for slipping, at the
which the other Friers had great meruaile, & demanded of him
wherefore he made those Truncheons. (^Rush^) answered and
said:$] Faire Sirs, I make them for this intent: that if there
come any theeues hither for to rob vs, and to spoile our place,
yet shall we haue weapons to defend vs withall. And
therefore I make them. And moreouer, when any neede shall be,
come to mee and euery man shall haue one, and they shall be
ready at your commandement, [$and then the Friers thanked
him and so departed.$] [^...^]
[^SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, A QUARREL BETWEEN THE PRIOR AND SUBPRIOR 
SPILLED OVER INTO VIOLENCE DURING MIDNIGHT MASS. WHEN RUSH SAW 
THAT ALL THE OTHER FRIARS WERE JOINING IN, HE BLEW OUT THE CANDLES
AND THEN SECRETLY SET ABOUT THEM.^]
<P B3R>
[^...^] [$Then when the fray
was done, and all the noyse seased, (^Rush^) came in among them
with a Candell light in his hand, and made as he had knowne
nothing thereof, and said to them:$] Fie for shame Sirs, how
fortuned this discord to fall among your selues? I see well
now you regard not your honour, nor the good name of your
place. All the people shall say ye be not honest, nor good 
religious men, the which words I would be loath to heare, and I
may not suffer our place so to fall in an euill name: 
wherefore good Masters, I require you to set your hearts at rest, and
put the matter into my hands, and I shall doe so much that all
shall be well, and you shal be good friends againe, and no words
shall be spoken thereof, [$then euery man complained to him of
their great hurt, and he made semblance as he had beene sorie
therefore and then they that could goe, went vp to their Sels,
and they that could not goe, did creepe vp as well as they could,
and laid them downe [^SOURCE TEXT: dnwne^] in their beds, and there  #
they lay till they
were whole againe, and in the space of three weekes and more,
God was euill serued, for in all that space they sung neither
Mattins nor Euensong, nor neuer entred into the Church for
it was suspended, and for shame they durst neuer let it be
knowne. And when they were all whole, and euery man vpon
his feete againe, and might goe about the house, they brought
<P B3V>
againe their staues to Frier Rush, and thanked him much, and
then Frier (^Rush^) said vnto them:$] Sirs when ye haue neede of
them againe, ye shall finde them here ready at your
commandement, [$for which they gaue him thankes, and departed.$]
[^RUSH LAUGHED TO HIMSELF, AND SWORE TO ENSURE THAT THEY WERE 
ALL ETERNALLY DAMNED.^]

[}HOW FRIER (^RUSH^) GRYMED THE WAGGON WITH TARRE, AND
WHAT CHEARE HE MADE IN THE COUNTRY.}]

   [$Another time it fortuned that the Priour had a iourney
to ride into the Country about a little businesse that hee
had there to doe, and anon he called (^Rush^) his seruant vnto him
and said,$] (^Rush^) goe thy way into the Court, and take with
thee a dish full of greace, and greace well the wheeles and
Axeltrees of the Waggon, and make all things ready against
to morrow in the morning, for I must ride forth to morrow
betimes, [$then (^Rush^) departed from his Maister, and went
about his businesse, and in steed of greace, hee tooke a great
vessell full of Tarre, and anointed the Waggon all ouer with
it, both within and without, and especially in the place where
the Priour should sit: and when he had done, he returned to
his Maisters chamber, then the Priour demanded of (^Rush^) , if
he had done as he commanded him:$] yea Sir [$said (^Rush^) ,$] ye may
ride when please you, [$and so they went to their beds. Then
on the morrow after, the Priour and (^Rush^) his seruant with
his other company, rose vp very early in the morning for to
accomplish their iourney, and forth they went vnto their
Waggon. and when the Priour was entred therein, hee perceiued
<P B4R>
himselfe all to berayed and smeyred, and all his clothes were
filed therewith: and then he said to (^Rush^) ,$] thou lewd fellow,
what hast thou done to this Waggon that I am thus arayed
therein? [$ (^Rush^) answered and said:$] Sir, I haue done nothing
but as you commanded me. That is not so [$said the Priour,$]
for I commaunded thee to take greace and grease but the
wheeles and the Axeltrees, and thou hast taken Tarre and
annointed it all ouer, both within and without. Why hast thou
done so? Sir [$said (^Rush^) ,$] I vnderstoode you bad me doe so. 
[^...^]
[^THE PRIOR CHANGED BEFORE JOURNEYING TO HIS DESTINATION IN 
ANOTHER WAGON. ON ARRIVAL, HE AND HIS COMPANY WENT STRAIGHT TO 
THEIR LODGING, WHERE THE PRIOR DINED WITH HIS HOST. WHEN THEY
HAD HAD THEIR FILL, THE REST OF HIS COMPANY FINISHED WHATEVER 
WAS REMAINING. RUSH DESIRED SOME WINE, BUT THERE WAS NONE LEFT.^]
<P B4V>
[^TEXT IN RIGHT-HAND MARGIN PARTLY CUT UNTIL LINE 24.^]
[^...^] [$And anon he 
called the wife of the house and said:$] Mistresse, I pray you fill a
pottle of wine for me and my fellowes, [$and so shee did: and
when that was gone, they called for another: and then they
called for the third, and so ended their supper. Then on the
morrow when the Priour had done all his businesse, and was
ready to returne home againe: he called for a reckoning. And
anon, the good wife came in and gaue him a reckoning of all
things, both horse meate and mans meate; and at last, she
reckoned three pottels of wine that (^Rush^) and his fellowes had.
And when the Priour heard that his seruants had drunke so
much wine: Anon he began to waxe very angry, and asked
her, who commanded her to fill in so much wine? the wife 
answered and said:$] Sir, (^Rush^) your seruant commaunded me to
fill it in, and he said, that you should pay therefore. [$Then anon
the Priour called for (^Rush^) , and said vnto him:$] Thou lewd
Knaue, why hast thou drunke so much wine? Might no lesse
then pottels serue thee and thy fellowes? Sir, [$said (^Rush^) ,$] we
haue not drunke so much, for your horses hath had two of the
pottels. My horses, [$said the Priour:$] what should they doe
with wine? Yes Sir, [$said (^Rush^) ,$] your horses laboured sorer
than we did, and were very weary, and they had nothing but
Hay and Oates: wherefore, me thought it needefull to giue
them some good drinke to their course meate to comfort their
hearts withall, and to cause them to be the lustier, and to haue
the better courage to bring you homeward. [$And when the
Priour had heard that answere of (^Rush^) , and saw there was
no remedy but patience: he paid for the wine, and all things
that he had taken there, and so rode home in his Waggon, and
Frier (^Rush^) neuer went foorth againe with his Master.$]
<P C1R>
[}HOW THE PRIOUR MADE FRIER (^RUSH^) SEXTON AMONG THE FRIERS, AND
HOW HE CHARGED HIM TO GIUE HIM KNOWLEDGE HOW MANY
FRIERS WERE ABSENT FROM MATTINS AT MIDNIGHT,
AND WHAT THEY WERE.}]

   [$When the Prior was come home, hee made Frier Rush 
Sexton of the church, and his office was to ring the
bell and to light the candles, and to cal the Friers to Mattins
at mid-night, and also the Prior commaunded Rush & charged
him, that he should take good heede that there were none of the
Friers absent from Mattins, and if there were to giue him
knowledge thereof, then saide Rush to his master:$] Sir all your
commaundement shalbe fulfilled, [$and so they departed.$] [^...^]
<P C1V>
[^RUSH REPORTED SO MANY ABSENTEE FRIARS TO THE PRIOR THAT
THEY BECAME AFRAID TO MISS THE SERVICE. SEEING ANOTHER 
OPPORTUNITY TO AFFLICT THEM, RUSH TAMPERED WITH THE STAIRS 
THAT LED TO THE CHURCH, CALLED THE FRIARS, AND THEN WAITED 
FOR THEM TO COME. THE FIRST FRIAR ARRIVED SHORTLY AFTER AND, 
BECAUSE OF THE BROKEN STAIRS, PROMPTLY FELL.^] 
[^---^] [$then said (^Rush^) ,$] thou art one. [$Presently there     #
came another,
and like wise downe he fell and had a sore fall,$] thou art two [$said
(^Rush^) . Anon came the third Frier, which had a mightie great
bellie, and was a grosse man, and he made great hast, for he
feared that he should haue been last, & when he came to the staires,
downe he fell on his fellowes necks, and he was so great and so
heauie, that almost he had mischieued his fellowes that lay
vnder him:$] thou makest three [$said (^Rush^) . And with that there #
came
seauen or eight together, and downe they fell all at once.$] Softly
masters for shame, [$said (^Rush^) ,$] ye come too many at once, ye  #
were
not wont to be so hastie, but now I perceiue well ye would
deceiue me, and one would excuse the other, and therefore ye come
so thick to blind me in my tale: How should I now giue account
to the Prior of them that be absent? Surely I cannot tell, but
<P C2R>
now I see well, ye be too subtil for me, I would some other man
had mine office, [$and made as though he had beene verie angrie
with them.$] [^...^] 
[^ALL THE FRIARS MANAGED TO ATTEND THE SERVICE, BUT SOME WERE
TOO BRUISED TO GO TO THEIR LODGINGS AFTERWARDS SO THEY SLEPT
IN THE CHURCH. WHEN THE PRIOR HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED, HE
SUSPECTED THAT RUSH WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED.^]
[$Then the Prior sent for (^Rush^) to come speake with him, and
when he was come, Prior said vnto (^Rush^) ,$] how fell this
misfortune to night among the Friers, that they be so sore hurt?
Sir [$said (^Rush^) ,$] I shall shew you, it is not vnknowne vnto you,
that when you put me first into this office, ye commaunded me
to giue you knowledge when any of my brethren were absent
from Mattins, and so haue I done diuers times, whereby
many of them haue beene shent and chidden by you, and for
that cause, they owe me euill will, and faine would haue me
out of this office, if they wist how. And for to accomplish their
desire, and to cause you to be displeased with mee: I shall shew
you what they haue done this night. Sir it is so, that when
the time was come, I rung to Mattins and lighted candles,
and made all things readie, and when I had so done I went
into the Dorter to euery mans Sell and called them up, then
I went and stoode at the staire foot, for to tell them as they
<P C2V>
came downe, as I was accustomed to doe, and to knowe who
came to Mattins, and who did not, and for spite that I should
not reckon them, they came all on a cluster, and for hast the one
thrust the other downe the staires, and he that had the greatest
belly, had the hardest fall; now if they hurt themselues, what
might I doe with all? [^...^]
[^THE PRIOR DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY, BUT SENT RUSH BACK TO WORK 
IN THE KITCHEN.^]

[^A FARMER WENT IN SEARCH OF HIS COW AND, FINDING IT CLEANLY 
DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS, IMMEDIATELY SUSPECTED WITCHCRAFT. UNABLE TO
RETURN HOME THAT NIGHT, HE SOUGHT SHELTER IN A HOLLOW TREE AND, WHILE
THERE, SAW A COMPANY OF DEVILS.^]
<P C4R>
[^---^] [$but anon there assembled a company of Deuils,
and among them they had a great principall Maister whose 
name was (^Lucifer^) , and hee was the first that spake: and the
first that was called, was a Deuill named (^Belzabub^) , and with
a loud voyce, he said vnto him:$] (^Belzabub^) what hast thou done
for vs? [$ (^Belzabub^) answered and said:$] Sir I haue caused
debate and strife to fall betweene brother and brother, insomuch
the one hath slaine the other: that is well done [$said the maister
Deuill,$] thou shalt be well rewarded for thy labour. [$Then
foorth he called another Deuill, named (^Incubus^) , and
demaunded of him what he had done?$] Sir [$said (^Incubus^) ,$] I    #
haue caused
great debate and strife, to fall betweene two Lords, through
the which they haue had great warres, and many men haue
beene slaine: [$then said the master Deuill,$] thou art a true
seruant to vs, thou shalt be well rewarded for thy great labour
and paine, [$Then said the great maister vnto another Deuill,
named (^Norpell^) ,$] what hast thou done for vs: Sir [$said         #
(^Norpell^) ,$]
I haue beene among players at the Dice and Cardes, and I
haue caused them to sweare many great oathes, and the one to
flea the other: and also I haue caused debate and strife to fall
betweene man and wife, and caused the wife to cut her
husbands throat: that was well done [$said the Master,$] thou shalt
be well rewarded for thy labour. [$Then foorth came another
Deuill named (^Downesnest^) , and said:$] Sir I haue caused two
olde women to fight so sore together, and to beat each other
about the head, that their eyes flew out: that was well done
[$said the master Deuill,$] with much thanke thou shalt be well
rewarded for thy labour. [$Then foorth stepped Frier (^Rush^)
freshly, and with a good courage, and said:$] Sir, I am in a
Religieus place and I gouerne the Prior and his Couent as I
will my selfe, and they haue me in great loue and fauour: for
I doe them many great pleasures, and I haue brought them
<P C4V>
faire wenches euery man one when they lust, and diuers times
I haue caused debate and strife to fall among them, and I haue
made them staues and caused them to fight stifly together,
and so breake each others head, and their armes and legges,
and yet will I doe more among them ere I depart out of the
place, for I shall make so great debate and strife among them,
that the one shall slea the other, then they shall come and dwell
with vs in Hell, and burne in perpetuall fire without end.
[$Then said the maister Deuill to (^Rush^) :$] if thou haue done as
thou hast said, thou hast done well thy part, and I pray thee
be diligent thy selfe about thy businesse, and stirre them to sin,
and specially to these three, that is to say, wrath, Gluttony, and
Lechery, and briefely to make an end of thy enterprise, and
slip it not: and when thou hast done, come home, and thou shalt
be highly exalted and well rewarded for thy great labour and
paine. [$When (^Rush^) had tolde his tale: the great maister
Deuill commanded euery Deuill to goe his way and doe the best
he could, and thus they departed:$] [^---^]

AND THAT HE WAS A VERY
DEUILL.}]
[^THE FARMER PRAYED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT AND, AS SOON AS FIRST
LIGHT APPEARED, WENT TO INFORM THE PRIOR OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN 
AND HEARD.^]
[^---^] Sir, this
night hath fortuned to me a great aduenture: how so [$saide the
Priour?$] sir, yesternight late in the euening, I walked foorth
in the fieldes to seeke a Cowe which I haue missed this foure
or fiue dayes, and so long I wandered abroad, till at the last
I founde the one halfe of my Cowe, but the other halfe was
gone; and as I woulde haue returned home againe, I was
benighted, so sore that I lost my waye: then I wist not 
whether to goe, but spying a hollowe Tree, I sate me downe, 
thinking there to take my rest till the day appered againe: and I
had not sitten there but a while, but instantly there was
assembled a great company of Deuills which made a 
maruailous great noise, whereof I was sore afrayd. They had
among them a great master named (^Lucifer^) . who called all the 
rest to make a reckoning of all their seruice they had done,
since they departed out of Hell: there I heard many 
marueilous tales. At the last, foorth came Frier (^Rush^) , then     #
saide the
great master (^Lucifer^) vnto him, (^Rush^) , what hast thou done
since thou departed out of Hell? and he answered, that he had
ruled you, and all your Couent, and caused you, to chide and
fight, and were neuer in vnitie and peace among your selues:
and he said he had caused you to liue viciously, and yet he saide
<P D1V>
he would doe more ere he departed out of this place, for
he will cause you to kill each other, and then you should be
damned in Hell, both bodie and soule. And so euerie Deuill 
departed and went about their busines. Wherefore take heede, for he
is a verie Deuill. [^...^]
[^AFTER THE PRIOR HAD THANKED THE FARMER, HE SPENT SOME TIME

FRIARS OF RUSH'S TRUE IDENTITY. AS HE CONFRONTED RUSH, HE CALLED

OF SERVICE.^]
<P D2R>
[$Then they demaunded him to what entent he came into their
place, and why he taried there so long?$] Syrs [$said (^Rush^) :$] I #
came
hither to cause you to do all mischife as is aforesaid, and yet I
would haue done more ere I had gone hence: for I would haue
caused you to slaye other, and to be damned both bodie and
souls. [$And when they had heard the words of (^Rush^) , euery man
held vp his hands and thanked almighty God, that they had so
well escaped that great misfortune. Then (^Rush^) desired the
Priour licence to depart thence, and promised that he would
neuer more come there, nor doe any man more hurt: vpon that
condition the Priour gaue him leaue to depart. Thus (^Rush^)
departed from the place, and the Friers went to their

[}THE LAMENTATION THAT RUSH MADE WHEN HEE WAS 
DEPARTED OUT OF THE HOUSE OF RELIGION.}]

   [$When (^Rush^) was banished out of the house of Religion,
and was turned into the same likenesse that he was,
then he wandred abroad in the worlde with an heauie heart,
& these words he said:$] Alas, alas, what shall I doe, I wote not
now whether to goe, for all my seuen yeres labour is left. [$And
as he wandred about, by fortune he met with his master 
(^Lucifer^) , but he would not haue seene him by his will: neuertheles
his maister espied him quickly, and said to him$] (^Rush^) what
tydings with thee? Sir [$said (^Rush^) ,$] I haue lost all my labour #
that
I haue gone about this vii. yeares. How so, [$saide his Maister?$]
Sir, I shall shew you [$said (^Rush^) .$] The last time that we were
assembled together, there was a poore man lay in an old tree
hard beside vs, & he heard all that we said: and when we were
departed, he arose and went vnto the Priour and shewed him
all that we saide and specially the wordes that I had spoken,
and so all my labour is lost, & am banished that place. Well,
[$said the master Diuell to (^Rush^) ,$] thou shalt goe some other way
abrode, and looke if thou canst finde any thing to doe:

[}HOW RUSH CAME TO A HUSBANDMAN (LABOURING IN THE
FIELD) AND DESIRED TO BEE ENTERTAIND INTO
HIS SERUICE.}]

   [$Rvsh trauailing vp and down, came to a Husbandman who
was labouring in the field, being all alone, and spake these 
<P D3V>
wordes vnto him:$] Rest you merie sir, me thinks you take great
paines to worke so sore your selfe: will it please you to 
entertaine a seruant? I am a poore young man & am out of seruice,
and I am very willing to serue you if you please: and I trust
to doe you such seruice, as shall be to your good content;
[$The husbandman answered him, and saide;$] young man, I
would gladly giue you entertainement, but my wife will
neuer be pleased with any seruant that shall come into my house:
Sir [$said Rush$] let me alone, for I shall so worke the matter,
that my dame shall be well pleased with me: well [$said the
husbandman,$] tarry with me till I haue done my busines, and
thou shalt goe home with me: [$when he had finished his dayes
worke, (^Rush^) went home with him, they were no sooner come
into the house, but the wife espying (^Rush^) , she began to gloome
and to looke meruailous angerly at him: which the good man
perceiuing, he saide vnto her,$] dame, I pray thee to be 
contented, thou knowest well inough that I haue more labour to
doe, then I am able to make an end of alone, and therefore I
haue hyred this young man to help me: [$when his wife heard
those wordes, she was more angry then before, and began to
braule and scolde as if the Deuill had bene in her, and said
vnto him:$] what a vengance needest thou to take a seruant? thou
art able inough thy selfe to doe all the busines that we haue
to doe, and why should we take more charge vpon vs then we
are able to beare? but I now perceiue thou art giuen to
lazines, and hast little minde to work thy selfe: [$when the good
man heard her so highly displeased, he said,$] dame, I pray thee
be contented, the young man is honest, and he hath promised 
me to be a good seruant: [$yet for all these speeches, she would not
be pacifyed, but brawled still: when (^Rush^) perceiued her great
impaciencie, he said vnto her:$] dame I pray you be contented,
and be not angry with me, for you shall haue no cause, my
Master hath hyred me but for a while, vpon a tryall, and I
trust, in that time, so to behaue my selfe, as to giue you both
content: and when my time commeth out, if you like my
<P D4R>
Seruice you shall haue it before any other whatsoeuer:
if not, I will be very well content to depart. [$When the
wife heard (^Rush^) speake so resonably, she pacifyed her selfe,
and said no more: which caused the good man to be very glad,
and so she set them to supper, and as they sate at meate, (^Rush^)
demanded of his Master what he should doe the next day? his
Master answered,$] thou must rise early and goe to the field,
and make an end of that which I was about this day; [$ (which
was a great dayes worke) so when they had supt they went to
bed.$] [^...^]
[^RUSH WORKED SO WELL THAT HE WAS NORMALLY FINISHED BY BREAKFAST
TIME AND THEN HE AND THE HUSBANDMAN WOULD EAT BREAKFAST TOGETHER.

[^---^] [$Then said (^Rush^)
to his Master,$] why are not your shooes better greased, I
maruaile that you can goe in them, they be so hard? Haue
<P D4V>
you no more at home? Yes, [$said his Master,$] I haue another
payre lying vnder a great Chest at home in my chamber:
[$Then said (^Rush^) ,$] I will goe home and grease them that you
may put them on to morrow: [$and so he walked homeward
merrily and sung by the way. And when he approached
neare the house, he sang out very loude: with that his Dame
looked out at the window, and perceiued that it was her
seruant, Shee said vnto the Priest:$] alas, what shall we doe?
our seruant is come home, and my Husband will not be long
after, [$and with that she thrust the meate into the Ouen, and
all that was vpon the Table.$] Where shall I hyde me [$said
the Priest?$] Goe into the chamber and creepe vnder the great
Chest among the olde shoone, and I shall couer you, [$and so he
did: And when (^Rush^) was come into the house, his Dame
<P E1R>
asked him, why he came home so soone? (^Rush^) answered and
said:$] I haue done all my busines, and my Master 
commaunded me to come home and grease his shoone. [$Then he went
into the Chamber and looked vnder the Chest, and there hee
found the Priest, and he tooke him by the heeles and drew him
out, and said,$] thou whoreson Priest, what doost thou heere?
[$With that, the Priest held vp his hands and cryed him 
mercy, and desired him to saue his honesty, and hee would neuer
more come there: And so (^Rush^) let him goe for that once.$]

[^...^] [$Then said the Priest$] where shall I
hyde me? come with me, [$said the wife$] into the Stable, and
creepe vnder the Maunger, and I shall couer you with straw,
and tary there till he be gone againe, [$and then she turned
againe into the house where she found (^Rush^) her Seruant, and
anon she demaunded of him why hee came home so soone?
(^Rush^) answered, that he had done all his busines, and he was
come to make cleane the Stable, and when the Wife heard
that, she was sorry in her heart, for she doubted that he would
<P E1V>
finde the Priest againe. Then foorth went (^Rush^) into the
stable and tooke a great Forke in his hand and began to shake vp
the Straw: and when he came to the heape that the Priest
lay in, the which seemed to him very great, yet neuerthelesse
with his forke he tooke all vp at once and bare it out of the
doore, and laide it on a great heape of mucke that lay there,
and with his forke he shaked the straw abroad, and when hee
had shaken out a little, anon he was aware of the Priests
Gowne: then hee said,$] what a Deuill art thou? [$and with his
forke he turned the heape, and then hee perceiued that the
Priest was come againe: then with his forke he gaue him
three or foure good dry stripes and said,$] whoreson Priest, what
dost thou heere? thou promised me the last day neuer more to
come heere, and how I see thou art a false Priest, but now I
shall make an end of thee, and then shalt thou neuer deceiue me
more. [$And when the Priest heard him say so, he fell vpon his
<P E2R>
knees and held vp his hands, and prayed (^Rush^) to saue his
honor once againe and he would neuer come there more, and if
he did then to doe with him what he would.$]
   [$Thus (^Rush^) let the Priest goe the second time.$]

[}HOW (^RUSH^) CAME HOME AND FOUND THE PRIEST IN THE 
CHEESEBASKET, AND HOW HEE TRAYLED HIM ABOUT

[^THE PRIEST KEPT AWAY FROM HIS LOVER FOR SOME TWO OR THREE
WEEKS, UNTIL HE SAW RUSH AND HIS MASTER OUT IN THE FIELDS. 
AS HE RUSHED TO BE WITH HER, RUSH AND THE HUSBANDMAN ATE THEIR 
BREAKFAST TOGETHER.^]
[^---^] [$and as they sate eating, (^Rush^) spyed a hayre
in the Cheese, and then he said to his Master,$] I trow my Dame
would poyson vs, or else she washeth not the Basket that the
Cheese lyeth in, behold it is all full of haires, I will goe home
and wash the basket and make it cleane: [$so leauing his
Master in the field and walking homeward, he sung merrily all
the way. And when he approached neare the house, the Wife
knew his voyce and perceiued that he was comming. Then
wringing her hands she said vnto the Priest,$] goe hyde you, or
else you be but dead. Where shall I hyde me [$said the Priest?$]
Goe vp into the chamber and leape into the Basket that
hangeth out at the window, and I shall call you when he is gone
againe. [$Then anon in came (^Rush^) , and she asked him why he
came home so soone? then said (^Rush^) ,$] I haue done all my
busines in the field, and my Master hath sent me home to wash
<P E2V>
your Cheese basket, for it is full of haires, [$and so he went into
the Chamber, and with his knife he cut the rope that the
basket hung vp, and downe fell Priest and all into a great poole of
water that was vnder the window: then went he into the
stable for a Horse and rode into the poole, and tooke the rope that
hung at the basket, & tying it to the horses tayle, rode through
the poole three or 4. times. Then he rode through the Towne
to cause the people to wonder at him, and so came home 
againe. And all this while he made as though he had knowne
nothing, but looking behinde him, espyed the Priest. Then he
alighted downe, and said vnto him:$] Thou shalt neuer more
escape me, thy life is lost. [$With that, the Priest held vp his
hands and said,$] heere is a hundred peeces of Gold, take them
and let me goe. [$So (^Rush^) tooke the golde and let the Priest goe.
And when his Master came home, he gaue him the halfe of his 
money [^SOURCE TEXT: mouey^] , and bad him farwell, for he would goe #
see the world.$]

[}HOW (^RUSH^) BECAME SERUANT TO A GENTLEMAN, AND HOW THE
DEUILL WAS CONIURED OUT OF THE BODY OF THE
GENTLEMANS DAUGHTER.}]

   [$When (^Rush^) was departed from the Husbandman, he
went abroad in the Countrey, to looke if he could find
any more aduentures: and so long he trauailed about, that at
last he espyed a great Gentlemans place, vnto the which he
tooke his way. And when he was come thither, as chance was,
he found the gentleman walking vp and down before his gate.
And when (^Rush^) was approached neare vnto him, he put off his
bonet and saluted him saying:$] Rest you merry good 
gentleman: Welcome [$said he:$] Sir, [$said (^Rush^) ,$] I am a      #
poore young
man and am out of seruice, and faine would I haue a good
Master. What Countryman art thou [$said the gentleman$] & from
whence commest thou? Sir, [$said (^Rush^) ,$] I was borne farre hence
and many a myle haue I gone to seeke a good seruice, but none
can I find. What canst thou doe [$said the gentleman,$] and what
is thy name? Sir [$said (^Rush^) ,$] I can doe any manner of thing
that shall please you to set me vnto, & (^Rush^) is my name. [$Then
said the gentleman vnto him:$] (^Rush^) tarry heere with me, and I
will retaine thee into my seruice. [$When (^Rush^) heard the
gentleman speake so, hee thanked him much and tarryed there.
Then as the Gentleman and (^Rush^) went talking together, the
gentleman said vnto him:$] (^Rush^) thou hast trauailed farre and
gone through many strange Countries: canst thou shew me
where to finde any man, can Coniure a spirit out of a womans
body? Sir, [$said (^Rush^) ,$] why aske you me that question? I shall
shew thee, [$said the gentleman,$] I haue a Daughter which is a
faire young woman, but she is sore troubled in her minde, and
as I suppose shee hath some Diuell within her body. Sir, [$said
(^Rush^) ,$] I pray you let me see her, and I trust speedily to finde
remedy for her. [$Then the gentleman brought (^Rush^) into the place
and shewed him his Daughter. And when he saw her he knew
what she had within her body: Anon he said vnto the 
gentleman,$] sir there is remedy enough for this. Well [$said the
<P E3V>
gentleman,$] if thou canst finde me any that can helpe her thereof, I
will reward him well for his labour, and thee also. Sir, I will
shew you what is to be done, there is a place of Religion a
forty or fifty miles hence, wherein I was a seruant a long time,
and the Priour is a cunning man in that science: and I doubt
not, but if he were heere euen now she would be holpen within
this houre. [^...^]
[^THE GENTLEMAN SENT A SERVANT TO REQUEST THE PRIOR'S HELP.
WHEN HE ARRIVED, THEY DRANK SOME WINE BEFORE WALKING TOGETHER
IN THE GARDEN. THE GENTLEMAN THEN TOLD THE PRIOR ABOUT HIS 
DAUGHTER'S PLIGHT.^]
[^---^] Sir, the cause that 
you be come hither is this. It is so, that I haue a young
Gentlewoman to my daughter which is grieuously vexed and 
troubled in her minde, and as I suppose she hath some wicked
Spirit in her body, and sir, it was shewed me by a seruant of mine
which was long seruant in your place, that you could helpe her.
Sir [$said the Priour$] what is his name? [$The gentleman said$]
his name is (^Rush^) . [$And when the Priour heard his name hee
knew him well enough, and said vnto the gentleman,$] sir, cause
the gentlewoman to come before me and I trust in almighty
God, shortly to finde a remedy for her, [$and when the 
gentleman heard the Priour speake so, he was glad in his heart, and
commanded in all hast to bring foorth his Daughter before the
<P E4R>
Priour: and when she was come into his presence, he
commanded her to kneele downe vpon her knees, and also he
commanded her Father and her Mother, and all the company that
were there present, in likewise to kneele vpon their knees, and
pray vnto almighty God for the young Gentlewoman. And 
then he himselfe said certaine prayers ouer her: then he lifted
vp his hand and blessed her. and incontinent there flew a great
Deuill out of her mouth. And the Priour bound the Deuill so,
that neuer after he came there. Thus was the young
gentlewoman restored to her right minde and health againe. Then
the Gentleman would haue giuen to the Priour a great
summe of money for his labour, but he would take none, but
said vnto the gentleman:$] Sir, I haue a new Church in
building, and I lacke Lead to couer the roofe: and as it is
informed me, this is a plentifull Countrey thereof. 
Wherefore sir, if it will please you to giue me asmuch as shall serue 
me: I and my Bretheren shall bee your dayly beadsmen,
and you shall be prayed for as long as the world endureth.
<P E4V>
Yee shall haue as much as shall serue you, [$said the gentleman:$]
But how will you doe for the carriage? Well inough [$said the
Priour. Then the gentleman brought him to a great heape of
Lead, and bad him take asmuch as would serue him.$] 
[^THE PRIOR CALLED FOR RUSH, COMMANDING HIM TO INITIALLY CARRY THE 
LEAD TO THE PRIORY, AND THEN RETURN TO CARRY HIM HOME, WHICH HE DID.
