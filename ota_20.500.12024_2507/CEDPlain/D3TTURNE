<S SAMPLE 1>
<P 21>
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgman.^) $] What day were the Jewels delivered?
   [$Sir (^T. A.^) $] Saturday.
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Thursday was the Robbery, Friday he was
Examined, Saturday the Money was removed, and that night
the Jewels were brought and he committed.
<P 22> 
   [$Sir (^T. A.^) $] If I have said any thing that he is not        #
satisfied,
wherein I have not true spoken, let him ask me, I shall not do
him the least wrong.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just. Hide.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT HAS TWO FULL STOPS TO  #
FOLLOW Hide^] Do so Mr. (^Turner^) .
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Do your Honours understand of Sir (^Thomas^) the
time the Robbery was committed? I shall ask him some 
Questions.
   [$Sir (^T. A.^) $] I have only one word more to say to you, that
before he went to the (^Hoop^) Tavern. Nay (said I) Coll. (^Turner^) #
be
ingenious whether this was not Mr. (^Tryan's^) money that he
removed, and he confessed it was.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just. Hide.^) $] That money was removed from his own
house.
   [$Sir (^T. A.^) $] Yes, but his Wife, Children, and Maid,
denyed it.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just. Hide.^) $] Mr. (^Turner^) , will you ask him any
Questions? what are they?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] I would ask all this back again, you are upon   #
your
Oath, Mr. Alderman.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just. Hide.^) $] You need not tell him that he is     #
Sworn,
the Court and Jury understand it so.

   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Go on Mr. (^Turner^) , ask your Questions.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] My Lord I demand of Sir (^Thomas Aleyn^) ,      #
whether
I did not tell him at the first, there was a wicked young man
had belyed my house and Family, saying that he supped there
that night, when he had not supped at my house these Twelve
Moneths.
   [$Sir (^T. A.^) $] I think I have done him that right already, he
desired me to Examine that young man, who said he supped at
Coll. (^Turner's^) , but I found he had been nor was not there.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Upon (^Friday^) night when the Alderman         #
pressed me
concerning the thing I told him, I had some suspition of some
persons, who formerly should have robbed Mr. (^Tryan^) a year
agoe, and I employed (^Mosely^) the Constable and Mr. (^Tryan's^)
man to go to (^Ratcliff^) , and I went another way.
<P 23>
Pray ask Sir (^Thomas^) whether I did not promise him to do all
I could.
   [$Sir (^Tho. Aleyn.^) $] I pressed him hard, he said he would
endevour it.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Whether did not I tell him that that money was
carryed there on purpose to gain the other Fellowes that had
the Jewels. Said I, if this money be taken away, he that hath
the Jewels will not bring them, and the remainder of the
Money; but that this Money must bring him to it that they
might share it.
   [$Sir (^T. A.^) $] There was not one word of this, his
Examination was contrary; he told me 400 (^l.^) was received of a
Goldsmith, he knew not his name, and 200 (^l.^) was in his owne
house, and that he removed it for two or three dayes till this
foolery was over; he said it was his own money, I said an
honest man need not thus remove his own money.
   One thing I have omitted, when I was examining of him in the
(^Minories^) , word was brought me his Son was fled away at the
back dore; I bid them run after him, but they said they saw him
leap over a great Ditch; he was not heard of till Yesterday,
though I sent out my Warrants for him.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Your self (as Sir (^Thomas Alleyn^)     #
sweares)
said you knew not of whom you had part of the money, but the
other was your own, and yet afterwards that the money was
(^Tryan's^) ; why did you say so?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] I will tell you the reason, I would not have my
businesse spoiled, and did feign those answers. My Lord, I do
demand of him whether Mr. (^Tryan^) and I had not made a
Bargain in the morning, whether or no if he might have his Goods
the person should be free, and that he had agreed no blood
should be spilt, that he had rather lose all his money and Jewels
then to forfeit such an asseveration which the Theif had bound
me, that I should swear to him, that by the blood of Jesus Christ
that was shed for him and all Sinners, his life should
be free.
<P 24>
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] You are beside the businesse.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] My Lord, I ask Alderman (^Alleyn^) whether I    #
did not
tell him this.
   [$Sir (^T. A.^) $] I told your Lordships two souls were pawned, as
he said before.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Do not spend your time thus, the        #
question's
short, whether you are Guilty of Robbing, or breaking the house
of Mr. (^Tryan^) , or no.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] I am as free as any man here.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] They will not beleive your own words.
   [$Sir (^T. A.^) $] I think I have done him no wrong by this
Evidence.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] I hope, my Lord, I shall have the benefit to    #
call him
again for a Witnesse for me.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] You may ask him now.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] No, when I come to my defence.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Yes, yes.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Oh your Honours most humble Servant, I am very
sorry I have put him to this trouble.

[$Mr. (^Tryan^) , his Servant, and Mr. (^Garnet^) Sworn.$]

   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Mr. (^Tryan^) pray (as you are able)    #
give an
accompt of this businesse.
[^TRYON'S ACCOUNT OMITTED. HE RELATES HOW HE WAS ATTACKED IN HIS BED, 
BUT MANAGED TO CRY FOR HELP AFTER THE ROBBERS, WHO KNEW WHERE THE KEY 
TO THE CASH-BOX WAS, HAD STOLEN C. £1000.^]
<P 25>
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] How came they by the Jewels?
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] I forgot something concerning some Jewels,
these Jewels were in a drawer under my Table in the
Compting-house, he was privy to that, because he did frequent
my house very long, and was very familiar.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Who was privy to all this?
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] James Turner.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Mr. (^Turner^) , would you ask Mr.      #
(^Tryon^)
any Questions?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] By and by when I come upon my proof.
<P 26>
   [$ (^William Hill^) , Mr. (^Tryon's^) man sworn.$]

   All that I can say is this; when (^I^) went out I locked the 
door double, and those things were there then.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] About what time?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Seven or eight of the Clock.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Was he a bed then?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Yes my Lord; when I came home again, I found
all these things gone; going down into the
Compting-house we found some Jewels gone and some left, and those
were inconsiderable to those that were gone; the best were
cull'd and gone: on Saturday Collonel (^Turner^) was
Arrested with two Serjeants, and sent the boy at the Hoop
Tavern for me; I took two friends with me, Mr. (^Gvrney^) and
Mr. (^Pilkinton^) , he prayed me to speak to my Master that
he would give Bond for him that the Serjeants might
discharge him, and he hast about his business, or else it would
be spoyled; proceeding into some discourse, (^I^) was saying
to him, it was a great providence that (^I^) and the maid was
not then at home, for if we had we should have been killed;
he answered, saith he, no, they would onely have bound
you and the maid: (^I^) asked him how it was possible to get
in? he answered, one went through the Entry in the day
time, and there lay till night, went up staires, found a
candle, light it, went up to his Chamber, took the Key
and went down and let in others.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] This story I was informed (^I^) told him.
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] I asked him how he came to know it, he said he
examined them.
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Did he never tamper with you about
making Mr. (^Tryon's^) Will?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Yes my Lord, he came to me about a year ago,
I went with him to the (^Cock^) behind the Exchange, it was
in a morning, he took me privately aside, told me the old
Gentleman your Master is very sickly, cannot live long,
had a good Estate, or to that purpose, and it was pity he
would never make a Will, and such an Estate should go
<P 27>
to the Building of (^Pauls^) ; saith he, I have prest him
several times touching making his Will, he said he had done
it, when we both knew he had not, and I believe he will
not make one. He told of one that could Counterfeit a
hand.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] Was it not (^Grainger^) ?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Yes my Lord, that that man could Counterfeit
a Will, and I and Mr. (^Garret^) , and another good fellow
should be the three Executors, and a third person
Overseer, and that would please the old man; I answered, I
would not have to do in such an unjust thing for all the
world.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Did you go to (^Turners^) to Supper that
night this Robbery was committed?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] No my Lord, to Mr. (^Starkey's^) in               #
(^Fanchurch-street^) ,
the Maid went along with me.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] One question more, you said you came in and
found the doors open, did you come in before the 
Neighbours?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] No my Lord, I had not known of it but that one
Gentleman at Supper went home with a Gentlewoman in
(^Leaden-hall-street^) [^NO ITALICS FOR street IN SOURCE TEXT^] ,    #
and hearing there was such a Robbery
in (^Lime-street^) [^NO ITALICS FOR street IN SOURCE TEXT^] , (^I^)  #
run with a great fright, came in and
found the doors open, and found the Neighbours within.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] The thing understood touching the Will hath
another face; his Uncle was an acquaintance of Mr.
(^Grainger^) , his Uncle that bound him Apprentice that lived in
(^Cripplegate^) , now in (^Cornhill^) . This (^Grainger^) had
counterfeited a Will touching my Lord (^Gerrard^) , and some body
else about an Estate; said I to this young man, you have
an Uncle acquainted with a notable fellow, one (^Grainger^) ,
and your Master making no Will (speaking merrily) this
fellow is able to make it for him. Ask him if I did not tell
him his Uncle was acquainted with such a person.
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] You told me so indeed.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] (^Hill^) , by the Oath you have taken, did  #
he
not perswade you to endeavour that you and he and
(^Grainger^) should counterfeit a Will.
<P 28>
[^LAST LINE OF PAGE 27 REPEATED.^]
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] He did my Lord; he told me, That I, Mr.           #
(^Garret^) ,
and another good Fellow, should be the three 
Excecutors, and another person Overseer, and that this (^Grainger^)
could do it undesernably; I answered him, I would not
meddle with it for all the world.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Go, go, go, this is malice, for it was meer
jesting with him.

[$ (^Elizabeth Fry^) sworn.$] 

   Mrs. (^Turner^) came to my house on Saturday morning
last, at six a clock in the morning; she knocked me out of
my bed, (^I^) asked who was there, she said, A friend; who
are you said I? Come and see, sayes she; I said, who, Mrs.
(^Turner^) ? she said, yes; I went and dressed me, and let her
in; she said, there was a Friend of hers, a Merchant newly
broak, he had a Wife, and seven or eight children; they
desired to secure the money till they had taken their Oaths
the money was not in their house. She said, her Husband
and her Son (^Ely^) was coming with it. I went and lighted a
Candle, there was she and her Son (^Ely^) with the money;
she asked me, If I had a spare chest; I said, Yes, there
was one within; she went in, opened the Chest, and she
put in the wallets of money, I know not how much, my
Lord. I asked her if there was any more to come, she
said, Yes, her Husband was coming with more; she went
to the door and let it in, but I know not who brought
that.
   [$ (^Justice Bridgman.^) $] Did not Mr. (^Turner^) come in?
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] Yes, my Lord, he opened the bags, and asked his
Wife touching the Seals; She said, the Gentlewoman that
owed the money, had desired me to pull them off. They
offered me twenty shillings for my kindness in it, told me,
they had power to give it from the Gentlewoman; desired
me if my sister or any should ask about it, bid me conceal
it, because the discovery would ruin the poor
<P 29> 
Gentlewoman and her Children, but rather to say, that they
desired me to let some linnen lie there.
   [$L. (^Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Were the bags sealed?
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] I see none sealed.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] How many wallets were in the shop?
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] I saw but three, and they put one into a Chest in
the shop, and two in the kitchin.
   [$L. (^Ch. J. Hide.^) $] At that time when the mony was brought,
was there any discourse of a 1100. pound?
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] To my best remembrance it was so.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Not a word of the sum.
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] There was five wallets brought into my house, three
in the shop, two in the kitching.
   [$L. (^Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Had they bags at each end?
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] Yes, my Lord?
   [$Sir (^T. Aleyn.^) $] You hear what the wench sayes, she sayes,
there was five wallets, three in the shop, two in the
kitchin; (^I^) took two in the shop, and only one in the kitchin.
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] My Lord, (^I^) have two apprentices little girles, #
when
all the people were in the shop, said out aloud, that they
saw Mrs. (^Turner^) go out of the shop with something in her
Apron, covered with a red cloth, while (^I^) was above, my
Lord.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Who should convey it away?
   [$L. (^Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Your Son was there.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Pray my Lord, ask her, which is (^Ely^) .
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] That is, [$pointing to (^Ely^) .$]
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] It was false, this (^Ely^) carried none, the    #  
Boy knew
nothing of it; both my Sons are dear to me, and if either
more then the other, it must be my eldest, and yet (^I^) must
say, it was (^John^) my eldest Son that carried the money,
this Boy was at home; She hath forsworn her self.
   [$ (^Fry.^) $] Your wife told me that (^Ely^) was to bring some.

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 32>
[$Mr. (^Hanson^) the Goldsmith sworn.$]
   [$The bag sealed was shewn him.$]
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Have you seen the Letter?
   [$ (^Hanson.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Doth that Seal and the Seal of the bag     #
agree?
   [$ (^Hanson.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Mr. (^Tryon^) , whose letter was that?
   [$Mr. (^Tryon.^) $] Dr. (^Henry Kings^) Bishop of (^Chichester^) .
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Open the Letter, and see whether that be
the Letter you received from the Bishop of (^Chichester^) . 
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] Shall (^I^) read it?
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] It is his Hand and Seal.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] Shew the bag and letter to the Foreman of
the Jury; [$which was done, and most of the Jury viewed it.$]
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] You observe this evidence; this was one of
the bags that was taken in the (^Minories^) , that Collonel 
(^Turner^) was then removing: Mr. (^Tryon^) had 600. pounds of the
Bishop of (^Chichesters^) in bags sealed; it appears by the
Letter to be his seal, and these gentlemen sware this was one
of the bags then pulled out of the wallet, and Sir (^T. A.^)
has had it in his custody since.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] One thing more observe, he asked his Wife
when the mony was brought into this womans house, have
you taken off the Seals? his Wife said, The Gentlewoman
directed her to take them off.
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Some were taken off, but it seems this was
left on.

[$ (^Here^) Turner (^spoke somewhat to the Jury^) .$]
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Pray Mr. (^Turner^) discourse not with  #
the Jury,
your whispering will do you little good, though (^I^) think
they are honest men, and will not be guided by you, yet
we expect the same carriage from you, as from other
Prisoners; you shall have all the justice that may be.
<P 33>

[$ (^Cole^) the Serjeant sworn.$]

   [$L. (^Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Speak your knowledge.
   [$ (^Cole.^) $] On (^Saturday^) in the afternoon about three a    #
Clock,
my brother and I arrested Collonel (^Turner^) in an Action
of seven hundred pounds.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] At whose suit?
   [$ (^Cole.^) $] At the suit of (^Thomas Lyon^) , who with others  #
was
bail for him.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] It was only hearing of this foolery that caused #
it.
   [$ (^Cole.^) $] My Lord, we went to the Hoop Tavern, he sent for
Mr (^Tryons^) man, that he should engage for this account, 
that he might have his liberty to look after master (^Tryons^)
business; soon after came the Constable, and he charged
us to assist him to go before Sir (^Thomas Aleyn^) ; by and by
(^I^) was saying, Collonel (^Turner^) , how could this house be
Rob'd, and none of the doors broke? O said he, I
took a man in the (^Minories^) , who has discovered it me; he
told me that one going into the Cellar in the Day-time,
lay there till night, then went up Stairs, found a Candle
and light it, went up to the Old Gentleman's Chamber,
took the Key from his bed-side, and went down, and let
all the rest of the Thieves in; the young man being there,
said, it was well the maid and I was not at home, we
should have been killed; no sayes he, you would not have
been killed, only bound.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] As the Fellow told me.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Did he not say nothing touching Mr.
(^Tryons^) tooth?
   [$ (^Cole.^) $] He said that the Fellow putting his finger in his
mouth to gagg him, the Old Gentleman bit him; and he
strugling to get out his finger, pul'd out his tooth.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] You are very perfect at it Mr.          #
(^Turner^) ,
every way.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] (^I^) my Lord, (^I^) examined him every way.
<P 34>
[$ (^Cole^) the Yeoman sworn.$]
   My Lord, (^I^) can say only what my Brother said before.
[^SPEAKER NAME OMITTED.^] Tell it. [^COLE SPEAKS:^] (^I^) arrested   #
him, [$ (^&c.^) And so related in the same 
manner his Brother did.$]
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Mr. (^Hill^) , what do you know about      #
breaking
your own Desk?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] My Desk was safe locked, and the Key in my
Pocket, (^I^) lost out of that Desk about fourty five pound of my
own.
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Where did it stand?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Upon a Table in the Ware-house; the Jewels were
in a Drawer under the Table in the Counting-house.
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] How did you leave Mr. (^Tryons^) door?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Double locked.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] Who had the Key?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] (^I^) had.
   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Was there more then one Key?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Alwayes two.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] Who had the other?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] The other Key was in my Masters Chamber.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] Mr. (^Tryon^) , how was your own door opened?
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] (^I^) called some of my Neighbours, and Mr.
(^Vander Anchor^) came up to me, it seems they had forced open
the door with a Crow of Iron.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] The door of your Chamber do you mean?
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] No, the Street-door.
   [$L. (^Bridgman.^) $] How was your Chamber door opened?
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] (^I^) never lock my Chamber door, but pull it too.
   [$L. (^Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Mr. (^Hill^) , the Counting-house where  #
the
Jewels were, was that lockt?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Yes, and the Drawer (^I^) think was lockt,        #
sometimes
he does, and sometimes he does not lock it.
   [$L. Ch. J. (^Hide.^) $] Was the House doors open, or no?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Before (^I^) came, the Neighbours had broke open  #
the
Door.
   [$L. Ch. J. (^Hide.^) $] Mr. (^Tryon^) , were your Counting-house
and Till, where the Jewels lay, lockt?
<P 35>
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] Ever my Lord.
   [$L. (^Ch. J. Hide.^) $] That night?
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] Yes my Lord.
   [$L. (^Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Was it opened with a key, or broken open?
   [$ (^Tryon.^) $] (^I^) know not how it was opened, my key was among
a bunch of keys.

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 40>
   [$ (^L. Mayor.^) $] Pray repeat one part of your Evidence
again; that was, that some body came to Mr. (^Tryons^) house,
from the house in the (^Minories^) , charging Mrs. (^Turner^) to
have been at that house.
   [$Sir (^T. Chamb.^) $] (^I^) said, that before (^Turner^) came in #
with the
Jewels, Sir (^Thomas Aleyn^) had received a little note,
wherein was affirmed, that (^Turner^) and his Wife had been there;
with which she was acquainted, and swore and took on, she
was a Whore for she was not there.
   [$ (^S. T. Aleyn.^) $] When (^I^) examined Mrs. (^Turner^) , she  #
would
own nothing. Why said (^I^) , will you deny this which is so
apparent? that you were there (the maid told you so now)
you denyed it when I charged you with it.
   [$Mrs. (^Turner.^) $] I did not, it's false, what did --
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Prethee be patient dear (^Mal^) , come sit thee #
down. 
   [$ (^S. T. Aleyn.^) $] I asked Mrs. (^Turner^) whether she knew of
any money carried to the (^Minories^) that day; she said, she
knew of no money at all; and said she was a whore that
that said it.
<P 41>
   [$Mrs. (^Turner.^) $] They put it to me that I knew who brought
the money to my house, and that a Woman acquainted them
so; I said she was a lying Whore that said so.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Mr. (^Hill^) , what time of night  #
did you
go out that night?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] It was 7 or 8 a Clock.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Was the dore locked?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Yes. 
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Did you carry the Key with you?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Was there any more Keys?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] There was another above in the Chamber by my
Master's bed.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Did you find that other Key when
you came back?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] In the same place?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] I know not that.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Mr. (^Hill^) , you have been       #
acquainted
with some Transactions between Mr. (^Tryon^) and (^Turner^) ; was
he not employed about a Mortgage?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] Two or three.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Was not the Names of some persons
given to you to that purpose?
   [$ (^Hill.^) $] We have two or three Mortgages my Master lent
him so much money upon: We heard of one man, but
whether he gave Order to Mr. (^Turner^) to take so much money
upon the Land, we know not.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Mr (^Tryon^) , have you inquired   #
after
the persons?
   [$ (^Tryan.^) $] No my Lord; I did beleeve all was true.
   [$ (^Garret.^) $] I have enquired after Sir (^Theophilus          #
Gilpin^) , but
cannot find that he has any Estate in (^England^) .
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] My Lord, (^Gilpin^) onely assignes a Judgement of
(^Wescott's^) .
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Then if (^Wescott^) be good, it is
sufficient; you should inquire after him.
<P 42>
   [$Sir (^Thomas Aleyn.^) $] My Lord; (^John Turner^) his Son there,
fled away from me, when I came to the House in the 
(^Minories^) .
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Why did you flie away?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] I did not, Sir.
   [$Sir (^Thomas Aleyn.^) $] No! You ran away as fast as you could;
you got over a ditch.
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] My Lord, a Woman cryed out, Get away and
save your life; and I not knowing what the matter was, I went
away.
   [$Coll. (^Turner.^) $] Poor Boy; he thought Thieves had been
coming, and affrighted him.
   [$Sir (^Thomas Aleyn.^) $] As to (^Ely Turner^) , I examined him
upon the Sunday, the day after his Father was committed, he
would not confesse the carrying of any Money; and the Maid
swearing it, I committed him also.
   [$Coll. (^Turner.^) $] What's that of (^Ely^) ? Upon my Soul, the #
Boy
carried none.
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] I carried vvhat vvas carried.
   [$Coll. (^Turner.^) $] My Lord, one Son is as dear to me as the 
other, but if either be more, it must be my eldest; but yet
I must say, it vvas (^John^) my eldest Son that carried the
money.
   [$Sir (^Tho. Aleyn.^) $] My Lord, (^William Turner^) vvas brought
before me on Tuesday or Wednesday; Sir (^Rich. Brown^) sent out
his Warrant for him, being a person of evil name, and likely to
do such a fact: Being taken, he vvas brought before me. My
Lord, vvhen Mr. (^Tryon^) looked upon him he suspected him;
I examined him vvhen he savv Coll. (^Turner^) ; he said, not these
three years, not to speak to him; and yet one at the (^Cock^)
behind the (^Exchange^) said, this (^William Turner^) staid for Coll.
(^Turner^) at his house tvvo hours; that Coll. (^Turner^) came in,
paid for the Pot of drink, and for ought he knevv they both
vvent together; thereupon I committed him.
   In the Afternoon I ordered this person to send his Servant;
one came and made Oath that he came in, and inquired for
Coll. (^Turner^) , asked for him, staid tvvo hours for him; that
<P 43>
they vvent both out of the house together; and this vvas on
the Wednesday, the day before the Robbery.

a care of him, he is a dangerous fellow; presently after Col.
(^Turner^) came in and paid for a Flaggon of Beer, and went
away.
   [$Col. (^Turner.^) $] I drank not with him, did I?
   [$ (^Dawes.^) $] Not that I saw.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Sir (^Tho. Aleyn^) , Did not this  #   
(^William
Turner^) deny that he had seen Col. (^Turner^) lately.
   [$Sir (^Tho. Aleyn.^) $] He said positively he had not seen       #
him these
Three years so as to speak to him; said, he was grown too
high for him.
[$ (^John Rowse^) ( (^Dawes^) Servant) sworn.$]

   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Do you remember when (^Will.       #
Turner^)
was at your Masters house? which is he?
   [$ (^Rowse.^) $] That's he [$pointing to (^William^) $] he was    #

Wednesday the 6 of this month.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Did (^James^) (called Col.) (^Turner^)  #

   [$ (^Rowse.^) $] He came, and said he staid for the Col. and by and
by the Collonel came?

   [$ (^Rowse.^) $] He went to the Bar and paid the reckoning.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] What time of the day?
   [$ (^Rowse.^) $] About 12. or 1. a Clock.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Bridgeman.^) $] Did you ever see them both there
before?
   [$ (^Rowse.^) $] No, I never see them together before, but several
others have inquired for Col. (^Turner^) at our house.
<P 44>
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] By the Oath you have taken, Did (^William
Turner^) say he staid for Col. (^Turner^) , and that after Col.      #
(^Turner^)
came, he paid for the Drink, and they both went away
together, and this on the Wednesday?
   [$ (^Rowse.^) $] Yes Sir, it was so.
   [$Col. (^Turner.^) $] My Lord, I left him there; he followed me

doe.

<S SAMPLE 4>
<P 63>
   [$ (^L. Bridgman,^) $] I will tell you what you have done; you
have made a very long story, and have taken up the time
of the Court these two hours in a Narrative, and when all
is done, answer me, Have you any Witnesse to prove all this
Discourse between you and (^Wilde^) .
<P 64>
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] I have by Witnesses to prove, I said this, that
there was such Discourses between us.

   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] No doubt of it, and so will many a man
at (^New-gate^) frame such a story as this.

   [$ (^L. C. J. Hide.^) $] You have told a long story about         #
(^Wilde^) ,
that you took him by the Throat, and that you were alone, 
what Weapons had you?

   [$ (^Turner.^) $] None my Lord.

   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] Had you a Lanthern with you?

   [$ (^Turner.^) $] No my Lord.

   [$ (^L. Bridgman.^) $] What time of the Night was it?

   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Twelve a Clock my Lord.

   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] You staid till foure, so they were foure
houres a bringing of the money.

   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
<P 65>
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] You took a man in the dark by the
throat, that man that was guilty of such a thing, as when
that you did let him go to call his Companions, to bring
the money, bring fellows to you single; I would be glad to
know whether in this case they would not have knocked 
you on the head, and killed you?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] My Lord, (^Wild^) had engaged his soul, and I my
soul to him, that if I would not discover him him I should
go away free.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] Great security indeed.
   [$Col. (^Turner^) called several Witnesses, (^ (\ (viz.) \) ^) Mr.
(^Vandeput^) , Mr. (^Covel^) , Mr. (^Legoose^) Mr. (^Snow^) , and    #
Mr. (^Mosely^) the
Constable.$] [^TURNER SPEAKS:^] I desire my maid may be called; pray #
ask Sir

her up with Sir (^Richard Brown^) and two Marshals men (pray
Gentlemen make not a laughing business of this) Sir 
(^Thomas^) pray where is my Maid.
   [$Sir (^Thomas Allein,^) $] I had this maid upon examination, I
finde cause of further Examination, and thereupon
directed an Officer to take her, and she is now in the
Garden.

[$Mr. (^Mosely^) the Constable examined.$]

   When I came first to Mr. (^Tryons^) , at Mr. (^Tryons^) house, he
was bound, then he asked where his Man and Maid was,
he said he could not tell, by and by the man came in, and
being asked where he was, he answered he was at Coll.
(^Turners^) at Supper, presently after we went to Colonel
(^Turners^) , he came to the Window, his Wife and two Sons
were in bed.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] Did Mr. (^Tryon^) give you order to come to
him?
   [$ (^Mosely.^) $] Yes my Lord, he did.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide,^) $] (^Mosely^) you were Constable were you  #
not?
what discourse had you with Mr. (^Turner^) about a dangerous
place that you did suspect where some people may be to do
such a feat?
<P 66>
   [$ (^Mosely.^) $] I never heard of any such thing spoken.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] You say Mr. (^Tryon^) he wished you to call
(^Turner^) to him; did he give you any order or direction to
search his house? who wished you to go up to the house to
see whether his Sons and Daughters were in bed?
   [$ (^Mosely.^) $] Mr. (^Turner^) did my Lord.
   [$ (^Turner,^) $] He doth not say true my Lord; pray ask him
when he came to my door and I opened it, whether Mr.
(^Tryons^) servant were there at Supper that night; I said no. Is 
your sons within said he? I said I. Pray let me see them.
   [$ (^Mosely.^) $] I came to Mr. (^Turners^) house and knocked at  #
the
door with some others with me, at last the Col. came out
of his bed. I suppose he came out of his bed, being partly
naked, he came down to the door, I asked him where are
your sons; they are in bed says he; said I Mr. (^Tryon^) is
robbed, he would have you come to him.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] Did he desire you to go up?
   [$ (^Mosely.^) $] No my Lord, but I asking him whether his sons
were in bed, he said, I prethee go up and see.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] My Lord, I would prove where my sons were on
Thursday night at ten a clock.

[$ (^Lord Marquis of^) Dorchesters (^servant examined^) .$]

   My Lord, till nine a clock they were with me at my Lord
Marquesses house.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] What time came they thither?
   [$ (^M. Servant.^) $] Between seven and eight at night.

[$ (^Col.^) Turners (^Maid examined^) .$]

   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Come Maiden pray tell my Lord and the Court
when my sons came home this night.
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] Between nine and ten a clock.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] Were your Master and his Sons in bed all
Friday night or no?
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] Yes my Lord they were.
<P 67> 
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Did your Master go forth on Friday night?
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] No, he was at home and in bed all that night till
eight a clock in the morning, and Thursday night before.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] A silly soul, she knows not what she says.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] I will ask you again, was your Master at
home on Friday night?
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] No I think he was not.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J. Hide.^) $] Why did you say so before?
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] I cannot remember Sir.
   [$ (^L Bridgm.^) $] She knows her Masters mind.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] No upon my soul, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. Bridgem.^) $] My Masters of the Jury, this is the use that
is made of this Maids testimony; she will say any thing,
she is no fit witness, no trust to be given to her either one
way or other.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Pray call Mr. (^Cowel^) , Mr. (^Legoose^) , Mr. #
(^Cook^) the
Goldsmith.
   [$ (^L. Bridgem.^) $] What do you call these for?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] To prove my Condition, my Credit and 
Reputation.
   [$ (^L. Bridgm.^) $] The Jury knows that already.
   [$Mr. (^Cook,^) $] Thus much I can say, that I have known him
some twenty years, I have had dealing with him to the
value of several 100 (^li.^) I have trusted him, and have found
him very faithful. I have seen in his possession Jewels to the
value of eight or ten thousand pounds; by which I suppose
if he had been such a person he might have done himself a
kindness by breaking.
   [$Mr. (^Legoose.^) $] All I can say is I have an acquaintance with
this person, he was a Solliciter, dealt honestly and
faithfully in a business wherein I was concerned, he hath lived
very well.
   [$Sir (^Richard Brown.^) $] Where you have heard one              #
[^SOURCE TEXT: on^] man say
he is an honest man, have you not heard a hundred say
otherwise.
   [$Mr. (^Legoose.^) $] There hath been an ill report that he hath
been a person that lived high.
<P 68>
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] Sir (^Richard Brown^) , no man in (^England^)   #
can say
black is my eye.
   [$Sir (^Rich. Brown,^) $] Mr. (^Turner^) , you say you were upon
(^Tower-Hill^) all Friday night, whether went you in the
morning.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] I came home between four and five in the
morning.
   [$Sir (^R. Brown.^) $] Your maid offered to depose even now, that
you did not rise all that morning before eight of the Clock.
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] (^ (\Lapsis Linguae\) ^) ; If the Girle be      #
mistaken.
   [$L. (^Bridgeman.^) $] Do not trouble your self with that, her
evidence is of no force.
   [$Mr. (^Jeffories.^) $] Col. (^Turner^) , I cannot say any thing  #
that
will be advantageous to you, My Lord, and Gentlemen
of the Jury; I have heard Mr. (^Tryon^) hath trusted him with
Jewels to a good value, and that Mr. (^Tryon^) had a very
good repute of him.
   [$Sir (^Rich. Brown.^) $] Pray what report hath he upon the 
Exchange?
   [$ (^Turner.^) $] I owe nothing there Sir (^Richard^) , nor none  #
there
can lay any thing to my charge, except it be that I am a
Cavalier.

<S SAMPLE 5>
<P 72>
   [$Lord Chief Justice (^Hyde.^) $] (^William Turner^) , what say   #
you?
you see what is laid to your charge; first, you are a person
of loose life, there were two at his Bed-side, he beleives
you to be the person that gagged him, and helped to bind
him.
   [$ (^William Turner.^) $] I was never in his house in my life, til
with Sir (^Thomas Alleyn^) .
   [$Lo. Ch. Ju. (^Hyde.^) $] Where were you?
   [$ (^Will. Turner.^) $] At home.
   [$L. C. J. (^Hyde.^) $] Make that appear.
   [$ (^Wil. Turner.^) $] I have none here.
   [$L. C. J. (^Hyde.^) $] He saith it was a man as like you as can
be.
   [$ (^Will. Turner.^) $] And I am as innocent as may be.
   [$L. C. J. (^Hyde.^) $] (^John Turner^) , that which is against   #
you is
this, you on Saturday morning very early, was busie with
your Father and Mother in the removing the money, and
then when you had notice [^SOURCE TEXT: notive^] that you would be
apprehended, you got away.
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] Sir, I did not know who it was that was
come, whether to apprehend, or upon any other score, but
the woman speaking to me, flee for your life, or such
expressions, made me go away I know not how.
   [$Lord Chief Justice (^Hyde.^) $] Did not you bring some
mony?
   [$ (^John Turner:^) $] I Did my Lord.
   [$Lord Chief Justice (^Hyde.^) $] How much was brought at
that time?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] I carried away two Bags to (^Wild^) .
<P 73>
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just. Hide.^) $] Did you know him?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just. Hide.^) $] Did you carry these to (^Weild^) on
Saturday-morning? Did not you carry them to (^Fryes^) house?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] We took them afterwards from the house
where (^Weild^) appointed us to meet.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] At what time of the day did you carry
them back to (^Weild^) ?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] Before Sir (^Thomas Allen^) came that day, #
I
was coming for more.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] To what place?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] At (^Tower-Ditch^) .
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] At what house?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] No house, but I delivered them at 
(^Tower-Ditch^) .
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] At what time of the day?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] It was before Sir (^Tho. Allen^) came,     #
about 8
or 9 of the clock in the Fore-noon.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] Was there no people there? who was
there?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] I cannot tell; I saw several other
persons.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] Did (^Weild^) stand in the street?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] How came you to know him?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] By my Fathers direction; and I had seen
the man at our house that morning when he brought in the
money.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] Whereabouts? was it near the
Quest-house? that is, the great house that stands in the middle of
way?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] It was hard by the signe of (^Noah's^) Ark.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] This is a likely story to be believed, that
you should in the day-time between eight and nine in the
morning, meet in the (^Tower-Ditch^) that man that was a noted
Thief, that had been in (^Newgate^) ; that you should tarry for
this man to receive two Bags of money: see how it hangs
together!
<P 74>
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just. Hide.^) $] How often did you go?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] Twice.
   [$ (^Hide.^) $] How much at a time?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] A single Bag.
   [$ (^Hide.^) $] Had you a Coat or Cloak?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] Just as I am now.
   [$ (^Hide.^) $] Had (^Weild^) a great Black Coat? and what did he #
do 
with the money?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] I know not; but I delivered one in the
street, and then went and fetched another, and he staid
ready for it.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] Was this all the money that was brought in
the morning, save that that Sir (^Tho Allen^) brought away?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] It was all, to my knowledge.
   [$ (^Sir Tho. Allen.^) $] Colonel (^Turner^) confessed to me on
(^Thursday-morning^) [^NO ITALICS FOR morning IN SOURCE TEXT^] that  #
more came unto his house, but that Rogue
(^Weild^) took it away. 
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] How much?
   [$ (^Sir Tho. Allen.^) $] About 200 (^l.^)
   [$ (^L. Mayor.^) $] How many turns did you make when the
money was carryed from your Fathers house to the
(^Mynories^) .
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] Twice.
   [$ (^L. Mayor.^) $] Who went first?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] We went both together.
   [$ (^L. Mayor.^) $] How much was carryed between you both?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] The first time I carryed 200 (^l.^) as I can
judge.
   [$ (^L. Mayor.^) $] Who carryed any more?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] My Father.
   [$ (^Sir O. Bridgeman.^) $] What did you bring the second time?
   [$ (^John Turner.^) $] 300 (^l.^)
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] (^William^) , one thing more: What was the
occasion of meeting you and (^James Turner^) at the
Ale-house?
   [$ (^VVill. Turner.^) $] I did not meet him, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. Bridgeman.^) $] You came thither, and called for a Pot
<P 75>
of Ale, and said you staid for Colonel (^Turner^) .
   [$ (^W. Turner.^) $] It is not right; I onely asked if Col.       #
(^Turner^)
used the Horse; by and by he came and paid for the pot.
   [$L. (^Bridgeman.^) $] You two went together; what was the
occasion of your meeting together.
   [$Col. (^Turner.^) $] Finding him there, I said I could not drink
with him, and so we parted.
   [$ (^W. Turner.^) $] I called for a pot of drink, and having no
money to pay for it, Colonel (^Turner^) coming by, I called him in,
and desired him to pay for it, which he did.
   [$L. (^Bridgeman.^) $] The Boy swore you said you staid for Col.
(^Turner^) ; can you justifie you were at home, or in any other
place? it is a great suspition [^SOURCE TEXT: supition^] ; the old   #
Gentleman charged you
to be very like the man, and you can give no account where
you were, and (^Turner^) and you met together the day
before.
   [$ (^W. Turner.^) $] I was at home.
   [$L. (^Mayor.^) $] (^William Turner^) , when did you shave your
Beard last?
   [$ (^W. Turner.^) $] Before (^Christmass^) .
   [$L. (^Mayor.^) $] Who shaved it for you?
   [$ (^W. Turner.^) $] A Barber in (^Golding-Lane^) .
   [$L. (^Mayor.^) $] When his hair is shaved off his chin, the other
man whose Name is (^Christmass^) , being a smooth-chinn'd man,
it's very possible that might beget the mistake in Mr.
(^Tryan^) .
