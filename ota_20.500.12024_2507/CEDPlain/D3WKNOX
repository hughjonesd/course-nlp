   [$This Examinant saith, That on the (^1st^) of (^April^) ,        #
walking in the painted Chamber,
(^W. Osborne^) came to him and told him, that he being informed that #
he had lived in
the E. of (^Danby's^) Family for some time, he had something of      #
moment to
communicate to him, which might be a means to save the Lord Treasurer,
<P 14>
whereupon this Examinant walked with the said (^Osborne^) into the   #
(^Abby^) ; being in the
(^Abby^) , (^Osborne^) delivered Papers drawn up by way of           #
Information, being five in
number, none of them bearing any date, and one Paper of several      #
Memorials of
(^John Lane^) , and (^William Osborne^) : The next day they brought  #
him to the (^Cloysters^)
in (^Westminster-Abby^) , several meetings they had afterwards, and  #
four Letters they
wrote to him: About the fifth of (^April^) they went together to Mr. #
(^Cheyney^) at
(^Chelsey^) , one of his Majesties Justices of the Peace; but he     #
told them, the business
being of an high nature, and matter of State, he desired to be       #
excused: About
a fortnight after, this Examinant went to Mr. (^Dewe^) , upon the    #
same Errand, and
received the like Answer as Mr. (^Cheyney^) had done; not long after #
he went likewise
to Mr. Secretary (^Coventrey^) , who told him, that he being a       #
Member of the House
of Commons, by whom the said Lord Treasurer had been Impeached, he   #
could not
meddle in that business: None of the forementioned Gentlemen, his    #
Majesties
Justices of the Peace, had a sight of any of the Papers, but only    #
upon the
Information (which this Examinant made in his own Name) they, and    #
Mr. Secretary
(^Coventrey^) , made the same Answer.$]
   [$This Examinant being something scrupulous in medling in the     #
business, they
told him, that they had been with Captain (^Thuar^) formerly, and    #
had acquainted
him with this business; and that he had advised them, it being a     #
nice business, to
let it alone, till the heat of the Parliament should be a little     #
over: About a 
fortnight after that, (^Will. Osborne^) , and (^John Lane^) had      #
communicated these matters to
the Examinant, they complaining that they knew not where             #
conveniently to
lodge, this Examinant told them he would endeavour to find them      #
Lodgings;
and the very same day, by the direction of the Lord (^Dunblain's^)   #
Coach-man, went
to the (^Sugar-Loaf^) in (^Pickadilly^) , and took Lodgings on his   #
own account, for
himself, and two of his Friends, and lay there with them. At the     #
time of their going
from the said Lodgings, which was four or five days at most, the     #
said (^Osborne^) and
(^Lane^) paid to this Examinant two Shillings a-piece; and during    #
the time that this
Examinant was with them, they constantly paid their Club. This       #
Examinant
further saith, that he hath communicated this business to the Lord   #
(^Latimere^) , and
that he had given the Papers before-mentioned into his hands to be   #
perused,
which he hath now delivered into our Custody: He likewise declares   #
neither to
have seen or heard of any body coming to them from the Lords in the  #
(^Tower^) , or
knoweth of their ever having been at the (^Tower^) . And further,    #
this Examinant
saith, that he never directly or indirectly did supply the said      #
(^Osborne^) or (^Lane^) with
any money, or made them any promise of Reward whatsoever; only he
confesseth, that at the (^Tun-Tavern^) in S. (^Martin's^) Lane, he   #
flung down a Guinney on the
Table, the said (^Lane^) saying he had no money, and promising to    #
repay it; and

Weeks; about the

whilst he lived with the said
Mr. (^Oates^) , he saith, he daily sent his Servants to Morning      #
Prayers, reserving one
only with him, to dress him: This Examinant saith, that whilst he    #
was his
Servant, he was never charged by Mr. (^Oates^) of opening any of his #
Letters, or of any
other misdemeanour: He further saith, that three Informations marked #
the

by Mr.

saving the said

subscribed, (^John Lane^) , none else being present, and thinks that #
they were truly dated
when written. This Examinant confesseth, that he, and Mr. (^Knox^) , #
and Mr.
(^Osborne^) , lay privately this day fortnight in (^White-Fryers^) , #
from the (^Tuesday^) to the
(^Saturday^) following; and from thence they went and lodged in a    #
paved Alley, 
leading out of (^Chancery-Lane^) into (^Lincoln-Inn-fields^) , and   #
there they rested all the next

removed into

their share of Charges
from time to time, both for Diet and Lodging, to the said Mr.        #
(^Knox^) ; and then the
said Mr. (^Knox^) paid all the expences to the persons to whom it    #
was due, but not in
their presence.

   [$This Examinant having been this day brought to the door of the  #
Commitee of
Lords, in order to a further Examination of what he had formerly     #
deposed, being
<P 16>
brought back to the Prison without having appeared before the Lords; #
the 
Committee having, by reason of the King's being come to the House,   #
adjourn'd the
hearing of this Examinant until (^Fryday^) morning; this Examinant   #
being touched and
pricked in his own Conscience with a real and hearty remorse and     #
sorrow for the
great Guilt he had contracted, in falsely swearing and accusing Mr.  #
(^Oates^) and Mr.
(^Bedlow^) , desired one Mr. (^Ricks^) , one of the Yeomen of the    #
Guard, to endeavour to
find out Sir (^Will. Waller^) , to beg his pardon, and let him know  #
that he was now
fully convinced of his sin, and should confess the whole (^naked     #
truth^) , though he
should expose his own Reputation to ruine, rather than encrease his  #
Guilt by
justifying of what in his own Conscience he is convinced to be false.
   This Examinant declareth, that the first time he ever met Mr.     #
(^Thomas Knox^) , it
was at the Sign of the (^Hole in the Wall in Duffins Alley^) in      #
(^Kings-street^) , and that
there Mr. (^Knox^) advised him what he should say concerning Mr.     #
(^Oates^) , in
Reference to any discourse either of the King, Queen, or Lord        #
Treasurer; that at this
Examinant's [^SOURCE TEXT: Examinatnt's^] coming to that House, he   #
was not to ask for Mr. (^Knox^) , but for the 
Number (3) After some discourse there how they should contrive an    #
accusation of
Mr. (^Oates^) , The said (^Knox^) gave this Examinant directions how #
to do it; and it
being late they broke up their meeting: This first meeting happened  #
to be on the 
(^Tuesday^) , or (^Wednedsay^) , before he left Mr. (^Oates^) : The  #
second meeting was agreed to be
at the (^Owle^) in (^King-street^) , on the (^Sunday^) following, at #
three of the Clock in the
Afternoon, and whoever should come first, should ask for the Figure  #
of (3) at the
Bar, but Mr. (^Knox^) , having some other extraordinary business     #
they made no stay,
or came to any Resolution; but appointed a third meeting, which to   #
the best of
this Examinant's memory was at the (^Kings-Armes^) in the            #
(^Bowling-Alley^) : but the
said Mr. (^Knox^) not coming at the appointed time, the Examinant,   #
and (^Osborn^)
walked in the Cloysters, and had not been there long but Mr.         #
(^Knox^) came to
them, whereupon, immediately they took Coach, and went directly to   #
(^Chelsea^) ,
to Mr. (^Cheyney^) , where they were to swear some things against    #
Mr. (^Oates^) , according
to (^Mr. Knox's^) Instructions, in behalf of the Lord Treasurer:     #
This Examinant, and
the said (^Osborn^) stayed in the Coach, whilest (^Knox^) (as he     #
told this Examinant, and
(^Osborn^) ) went to speak with (^Mr. Cheyney^) , who stayed not     #
very long; and at his
return told them that (^Mr. Cheyney^) refused to meddle in the       #
business, whereupon
they return'd to (^White Hall^) . This Examinant being yet in (^Mr.  #
Oates^) his service:
The (^Monday^) following this Examinant came away from (^Mr.         #
Oates^) , and either on
that very day, or the day following, had another meeting with        #
(^Knox^) , and (^Osborne^)
at the (^One-Tun Tavern^) in St. (^Martins-Lane^) , by the sign all  #
of the Number (3)
where (^Knox^) treated this Examinant with Oysters, and Wine; and    #
after they had
eaten their Oysters, (^Mr. Knox^) , and (^Osborne^) , wrote out the  #
Informations, (^Knox^)
being the (^Dictator^) of them; and at the same time the said        #
(^Knox^) made this
Examinant, and the said (^Osborne^) swear secresie: what this        #
Examinant's part was to swear,
(^Knox^) prevail'd with (^Osborne^) to write down, because the       #
Examinant could not write
a good hand. The writings being finisht, (^Knox^) took them and put  #
them in his
pocket, and paid the reckoning, offering them before hand, if they   #
would either eat, or
drink, they might call for whatever they had a mind to; and told     #
them, because
it should not be said, he had given them money, he would contrive in #
a short time to
convey some to them, and appointed the same place to meet at the     #
next day by two
of the clock, and according to the agreement, they all met at the    #
said place; where
after they had drank a Pint of Sack, he dropped a Guinney on the     #
Table, and told
them, that on the next day they should have another; and after they  #
had been by him
enjoined secresie, they parted: The next day (^Osborne^) (as this    #
Exeminant was told
by him) he met the said (^Knox^) and received a Guinney according to #
(^Knox^) his
promise the day before; the same day as (^Osborne^) had received the #
Guinney of (^Knox^) ,
in the Evening (^Osborne^) came to the Examinant's Lodgings in       #
(^Westminster^) , and
then told this Examinant of the Guinney he had received, and         #
return'd him ten
shillings, which the day before this Examinant had lent him: A day   #
or two after
<P 17>
they had another meeting at the (^Green Dragon^) in the              #
(^Pel-mel^) , and there
dined, after Dinner, Mr. (^Osborn^) was desired by (^Knox^) to write #
a letter,
according to such a manner as he would direct, and caused him to     #
date the
Letter of a latter date, and direct the said Letter to him, which    #
being done
he put up the Letter in his Pocket; and having clubbed in the        #
payment of the
Reckoning which came to twelve pence a piece, parted for that time, 
appointing a meeting the same night to be at the (^Rose Tavern^) in  #
the (^Pel-mel^) , to
be at nine of the clock,$] where accordingly we met, and supped      #
together, and
conferred with (^Knox^) , asking how things went? to which he        #
answered (^very 
well^) ! about ten of the clock at night we parted, and came to      #
(^Westminster^) , and
agreed the next day to meet in a little Alley near the               #
(^Rose-Tavern^) in the
(^Pell-mel^) , at an (^Ordinary^) , about seven or eight in the      #
evening, where we met
and had a Supper, [$and at this House (^Knox^) took the first        #
lodging for this
Examinant and the said (^Osborne^) , and lay there the same night.   #
The next
morning after they had broke their fast, Mr. (^Knox^) came to this   #
Examinant and
(^Osborne^) , and told them that he had provided them another        #
lodging at the
(^Cider-house^) in (^Leicester-fields^) at the sign of the           #
(^Apple-tree^) , and at the said
Cider-house, this Examinant and (^Osborne^) continued from           #
(^Tuesday^) or
(^Wednesday^) to (^Saturday^) , during which time (^Knox^) caused    #
(^Osborne^) to write him a 
Letter, as he should direct him, which he did, and gave it to        #
(^Knox^) , who
continually advised both (^Osborne^) and (^Knox^) , to seem to press #
him earnestly to
engage in this business; on the Saturday this (^Examinant^) and      #
(^Osborne^) ,
changed their lodgings which were provided for them by (^Knox^) , in #
a little (^paved
Alley^) leading out of little (^Lincolnes-Inn fields^) into          #

said (^Knox^) lay with this (^Examinant^) and (^Osborne^) , in one   #
and the same bed:
The next morning (^Knox^) with this (^Examinant^) and (^Osborne^)    #
(their lodgings
being paid for by (^Knox^) ) went together into (^Whitefriers^) ,    #
and (^Knox^) took 
lodgings next door to a Musick house, where they all three lodged    #
for near
a week, after which time, Mr. (^Knox^) having (as he told this       #
Examinant)
pay'd the Reckoning; This (^Examinant, and Osborne, and Knox^) ,     #

until last
Fryday at which time this Examinant was seized at his Fathers house  #
at the
sign of the (^Wooll-pack^) in (^Westminster^) : This Examinant       #
farther saith, that
all charges for diet and lodging in the said respective places were  #
paid, and
cleared by Mr. (^Knox^) , unless at the (^Green-Dragon^) in the      #
(^Pell-mell^) , and the
(^Owle^) in (^King-street^) , where this (^Examinant^) and the said  #
(^Osborne^) paid their
Clubs, which to the best of this Examinants memory did not exceed
eighteen pence a piece. This (^Examinant^) doth further say that by  #
way of
encouragement the said (^Knox^) told Mr. (^Osborne^) , in his        #
hearing, that for what
he should say in behalf of the (^Lord Treasurer^) he should be sure  #
of a
considerable reward both of Money, and preferment. And the said      #
(^Knox^) did
likewise tell this (^Examinant^) for his encouragement that he       #
should want neither
money nor a good place as long as he should live: And least any of   #
these
proceedings should be discovered, either by (^William Osborne^)      #
[^SOURCE TEXT: (^Osbrone^) ^] , or this
(^Examinant^) , the said (^Knox^) , told them, that if either of     #
them should make a
discovery of him, he would be sure to dispatch them by one meanes or #
other,
and if he should discover them [^SOURCE TEXT: then^] he would freely #
grant them the same liberty.
This Examinant likewise saith, that (^Knox^) assured him, he should  #
not doubt
<P 18>
but that the (^Lords in the Tower^) would likewise own his kindness  #
to them
in Accusing Mr. (^Oates^) and Mr. (^Bedlow^) : And further this      #

discourse between Mr. (^Bedlow^) , and Mr. (^Oates^) tending to any  #
Accusation
against the (^Lord Treasurer^) ; but this Examinant did see the      #
Information that Mr.
(^Bedlow^) gave against the Lord Treasurer, which Mr. (^Wiggins^) ,  #
Mr. (^Bedlows^) Clerk,
shewed to this (^Examinant^) , after the same was sworn publickly.   #
And this
Examinant further saith, that he never heard Mr. (^Oates^) say that  #
he had any
accusation to make against the (^Queen^) , or had made any: and the  #
worst word he ever
heard him speak of the (^Queen^) was,$] (^Where is our Dame^) going? #
[$which was
when he saw the Guard drawn out in the Yard to attend her Majesty.   #
And
this Examinant further saith, that one day at Dinner, when Mr.       #
(^Wharton^) , Mr.
(^Oates his Father^) , Dr. (^Jones^) and others were present, some   #
discourse happen'd
between them about Sir (^John Robinson^) , and sometime after the    #
naming of him, 
Mr. (^Oates^) did say these words:$] (^We have not gone to bed sober #
these four years^) :
[$which  Mr. (^Thurston^) , Mr. (^Lane^) , and this (^Examinant^)    #
did think to be (^spoken of the
King^) , but this Examinant cannot say 'twas spoken of His Majesty,  #
in regard
he can give no reason why to apply it so. And he further saith, that #
he
cannot remember, or call to mind, that he ever heard Mr. (^Oates^)   #
speak any undecent
words of any passages between His Majesty and Mr. (^Cheffinch^) ;    #
and this
(^Examinant^) further saith, that he hath layen several nights with  #
Mr. (^Oates^) , but never
found he afford the least lascivious or undecent action to this      #
(^Examinant^) , but did
exhort this (^Examinant^) from time to time to lead a good course of #
Life, free from
doing evil, and often made this (^Examinant^) to read Sermons, and   #
other Books
by him: And this (^Examinant^) further saith, That upon the first of #
(^April^) last,
Mr. (^John Lane^) (now Prisoner with this Examinant in the           #
(^Gatehouse^) , and 
formerly fellow servant with this (^Examinant^) to Mr. (^Oates^) )   #
brought this
Examinant to Mr. (^Knox^) in the (^painted Chamber^) , who thence    #
went to the Cloysters
in the Abbey with this Examinant, where he discoursed about the      #
(^Earl of
Danby^) , and Mr. (^Knox^) proposed then to this (^Examinant^) ,     #
(^That if this Examinant
would swear, That Mr.^) Bedlow (^came to Mr.^) Oates (^his Chamber,  #
and there said,
that he had been with the^) Earl of Danby, (^and that the^) Earl of  #
Danby (^had
promised him money to go beyond Sea, and that this was a contrived   #
story, between
the said Mr.^) Oates, (^and Mr.^) Bedlow, (^to take away the Earl of #
Danby's Life^) ,
that in such case, this Examinant should have enough to maintain this
Examinant and a Footboy to attend him. And this Examinant saith,     #
that he
met Mr. (^Knox^) in the same Cloysters afterwards twice, they two    #
being alone,
when he alwayes continued his discourse, and promises of what great  #
rewards
this (^Examinant^) should have if he would swear that Mr.            #
(^Bedlow^) , and Mr. (^Oates^) ,
in this Examinants hearing contrived the design against the Lord     #
Treasurer,
<P 20>
whereby to prove; that the said Mr. (^Oates^) , and Mr. (^Bedlow^)   #
in this Examinants
hearing should say,$] (^Come let us contrive a story to ruine the    #
Lord Treasurer^) , 
[$and that Mr. (^Bedlow^) should within a day or two after come to   #
Mr. (^Oates^) and
say,$] (^now I have found out a way to do the Rogues business for    #
him: I will swear
he hath offer'd me money to go beyond Sea^) , [$and that Mr.         #
(^Oates^) should reply,$] (^you
could never have thought of a better way^) . [$And this              #
(^Examinant^) was to swear,
that all these things were spoken in this Examinants hearing: And upon
these Conditions Mr. (^Knox^) promis'd this (^Examinant^) sufficient #
reward. And
this Examinant saith, that Mr. (^Lane^) was not to swear to these    #
things, (as Mr.
(^Knox^) told this Examinant.) And this (^Examinant^) further saith, #
that He, Mr.
(^Lane^) , and Mr. (^Knox^) , met several times together, and when   #
Mr. (^Knox^) had
any thing to say to this (^Examinent^) , he took him aside in the    #
Room; and when
he had any thing to say to Mr. (^Lane^) , he took him aside also,    #
and so discoursed
them severally: But about this (^Tuesday^) was a (^fortnight^) , Mr. #
(^Knox^) took a
lodging for this Examinant, Mr. (^Lane^) , and himself, in (^White   #
Friers^) at the (^three
Flower de Luces^) , where they lodged, till the (^Saturday^) night   #
following, and in
that time Mr. (^Knox^) dictated to this Examinant, what should be this
(^Examinants^) , and (^John Lanes^) Depositions, and they were       #
written once before
at the (^one Tun Tavern^) in St. (^Martins Lane^) : And he saith,    #
that what Mr. (^Lanes^)
part in his Deposition about the (^Queen^) , was to be, was not      #
spoken of till the
the lodging in (^White Friers^) , though the other part of the       #
Depositions, were
dictated by Mr. (^Knox^) before: And he further saith, that the      #
(^four Letters^) , 
now shewed this Examinant marked (1) (2) (3) (4) are all of this
Examinants hand Writing, but were directed by Mr. (^Knox^) , what    #
they should
contain, and were antedated several days before they were written    #
(by Mr.
(^Knox^) his direction) because it should appear thereby, that this  #
(^Examinant^) ,
and Mr. (^Lane^) invited the said Mr. (^Knox^) to take their         #
Depositions, and to
bring them to light as a matter of Conscience, not of his, Mr.       #
(^Knox^) , his
own seeking; and this (^Examinant^) further saith, that the          #
(^Informations^)
marked (1.) (2.) (3.) (4.) (5.) and the (^Memorials^) marked (6.)    #
are all of
this Examinants hand Writing, and were all dictated                  #
(^ (\verbatim\) ^) to this
Examinant , to be the (^Informations upon Oath^) of this             #
(^Examinant^) , and the said Mr.
(^Lane^) : And this (^Examinant^) saith, that Mr. (^Knox^) took this #
(^Examinant^) , and
Mr. (^Lane^) in a Coach with him out of Town, with an intent to have #
them
sworn before Mr. (^Cheyney^) at (^Chelsea^) , where this             #
(^Examinant^) , and Mr. (^Lane^)
continoed in the Coach, while Mr. (^Knox^) went out, and at his      #
return Mr.
(^Knox^) told us, that Mr. (^Cheyney^) would not take the            #
Informations, but advised
they should be taken before (^one of the Privy Counsellors^) , who   #
should be one
of the (^Lord Treasurers friends^) : And this Examinant saith, that  #
afterwards
they removed their Lodgings into an Alley leading into (^little 
Lincolns-Inn-fields^) out of (^Chancery Lane^) , where they staid on #
(^Sunday^) was a seven night last;
and on (^Monday^) following they removed to (^Pickadilly^) , to the  #
(^three Sugar Loaves^) , in
all which time, and places Mr, (^Knox^) heartned up this Examinant   #
and Mr. (^Lane^)
to stand to the Depositions aforesaid: promissing great rewards, and #
bearing
all their expences, affording what meat or wine was desired, and     #
some Treats he
bestowed, which amounted to near twenty shillings a time at          #
(^Taverns^) . And this
Examinant saith, that Mr. (^Lane^) being taken, Mr. (^Knox^) sent a  #
Hackney-Coach to
this Examinants Lodging, at the said (^three Sugar Loaves^) in       #
(^Pickadilly^) , with
the (^Lord Dumblaines^) Coachman, and this Examinant went into the   #
Coach
and took up Mr. (^Knox^) at the (^Mews^) , and then this Examinant was
carried into (^White Friers^) , to another Lodging, where Mr.        #
(^Knox^) Lodged with
this Examinant one night, being (^Friday^) night last, and then he   #
said that the
<P 21>
taking of Mr. (^Lane^) would be for the better, because they should  #
sooner come
to an end; and he heartened up this (^Examinant^) , and said, that   #
if this
Examinant should be taken also, a thousand pounds Bail would be      #
given for this
(^Examinants^) Liberty. And he further saith that (^Mr. Knox^) gave  #
this (^Examinant^)
one Guinney at one time, by throwing it on the table, that this      #
(^Examinant^)
might take it up; but it was so orderd that it should not be given   #
this
Examinant, that he might safely swear no money was given him; and at #
the last
lodging in (^Whitefriers^) (^Mr. Knox^) came, and lay down on a bed  #
by the
(^Examinant^) , and then laid his Arm over this (^Examinant^) , and  #
let fall ten shillings, which
this Examinant took up also: And (^Mr. Lane^) told this              #
(^Examinant^) that (^Mr. 
Knox^) had given him one Guinny, in the same manner, by throwing it  #
on a 
Table. And he further saith, that Mr. (^Knox^) told this Examinant,  #
that he saw
Mr. (^Lane^) taken, and walked by Mr. (^Wiggins^) in a Troopers      #
Cloak at the
same time. And this day this Examinant being in a Room in the
(^Gatehouse^) , a Note was brought to this Examinant, it being       #
thrust under the door,
wherein was written these words, or to the effect following: (^You   #
will be
examined this afternoon; we always clubbed, and you paid two         #
shillings at the 
Sugar-Loaf^) : Tear this! but no name to it, which this Examinant    #
knows to be of
Mr. (^Knox^) his hand Writing; and further at present saith not.$]
