which is about 2000 (^l.^)

   [$ (^Busby.^) $] She has 20 (^l.^) a Year.
   [$ (^Mr. Serg. Darnel.^) $] What Age is she of?

   [$ (^Busby,^) $] She was unmarried.
   [$Then Mrs. (^Sabina Busby^) was called and Sworn, as also Mrs.   #
(^Nightingale^) .$]
   [$ (^Swendsen.^) $] My Lord, I beg the favour that only one       #
Witness be heard at a time.
   [$ (^Mr. Sol. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Nightingale^) , Do you know Mrs.   #
(^Pleasant Rawlins^) , and Mrs. (^Busby^) ?
   [$ (^Nightingale,^) $] Yes, I do.
   [$ (^Sol. G.^) $] Have they lodged at your House?                 #
[$ (^Night.^) $] Yes. [$ (^S. G.^) $] How long? [$ (^Night.^) $]     #
Above three Years.
   [$ (^S. G.^) $] Have you any knowledge of Mrs. (^Baynton^) ?      #
[$ (^Night.^) $] Yes. [$ (^S. G.^) $] How came you acquainted with   #
her?
   [$ (^Night.^) $] One Mrs. (^St. John^) came to me to know whether #
I took Boarders? I said, I had taken some, but 
would take no more, unless it were the same Ladies again.
   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] Who was it came to you?
   [$ (^Nightingale,^) $] One Mrs. (^St. John^) .
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Nightingale^) speak out that my Lord   #
may hear you.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did Mrs. (^Busby^) lodge with you?
   [$ (^Nightingale,^) $] Yes my Lord, we were very intimate before, #
and since it pleased God to take away
her Husband, I was pleased with her, and very willing to take her    #
into my House. 
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Acquaint his Lordship how Mrs. (^St. John^)   #
came to you.
   [$ (^Nightingale.^) $] Yes, my Lord, as near as I can. She came   #
to me and ask'd me, If I took Boarders? 
I told her No, I would take none except it were those Ladies I had   #
before, She told me she had an 
Acquaintance that was a Widow Lady that came out of (^Wiltshire^) ,  #
about a Suit of Law, and 
would be in a very sober Family near a Church; but however I deny'd  #
her Lodgings, and did expect to 
hear no more of her; but about three Weeks or a Month after she came #
to me again, and asked me 
whether I had altered my Resolution?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Go on.
   [$ (^Nightingale.^) $] My Lord, Mrs. (^St. John^) said, that the  #
Lady was come to Town on the (^Saturday^) 
Night before, very much Indisposed in her Journey. I asked her       #
whether she knew this (^Baynton^) or 
no. Mrs. (^St. John^) said Yes, she was very Intimate in the Family, #
and she said a great deal more of 
her, which I cannot remember. She said also, that she would have     #
Boarded her her self, and would 
have been glad of her Company if she had had Conveniences for her.   #
Then she asked me, whether 
she should come her self and give her own Character? We thought no   #
harm, she being a Woman, 
and not a Man. She further said, that Mrs. (^Baynton^) had been a    #
Maid whom I knew, and she 
believed she would take her. I enquired of another who lived in the  #
(^Mews^) , if he knew Mrs. (^Baynton^) ,
he said Yes, and that she came of a good Family. At length she came  #
and made a very modest 
Appearance in her Behaviour and Garb. She said to me, that I was     #
very curious in taking Boarders, 
and for that she liked me the better. I consented she should come.   #
She asked me what I would have 
a Week? I told her twelve Shillings for her self and ten Shillings   #
for her Maid. She concluded to 
come on the (^Wednesday^) following, which she did with her Maid, a  #
modest Girl and a Neighbour,  
which gave me the more Encouragement. She carried her self very well #
till (^Michaelmas-day^) [^NO ITALICS IN SOURCE TEXT FOR day^] at 
Night, when we heard of her New Brother; she seem'd Elevated at the  #
News, and fell into 
Convulsion Fits, which I believed were real Fits. She said she had a #
dear Brother, a good Christian, and he would 
come on the Morrow; when he came he brought two Gentlewomen with     #
him, very Modest, which I 
never saw before, nor since. Mrs. (^Baynton^) made a Pot of Coffee,  #
and sent for a Bottle of Wine, and 
she told her Brother before me, what good Lodgings she had, and said #
she wished he would come and 
<P 4>
Lodge near them, for she knew he had but a puney Stomach, and        #
believed he would like her Victuals; 
he said it was not convenient for him because his Business called    #
him every Day to the Change; she 
said also there was a Bowling Green near them, where he might divert #
himself, but all would not 
do. She asked me what I would have a Meal if her Brother should come #
at any time. I said, when 
I had other Ladies, if any of their Friends came I had twelve Pence  #
a Meal of them. On (^Friday^) he 
came. I went to Church, and left them together at Cribbage, as I     #
found them at my return.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What Day of the Week was this?                 #
[$ (^Night.^) $] The (^Friday^) before the Sacrament: Mrs. (^Baynton^)
said to Mr. (^Swendsen^) , before Mrs. (^Busby^) , you have an       #
extraordinary hand at making Punch, so they 
agreed to make a Bowl the (^Mundy^) following; but Mrs. (^Rawlins^)  #
hardly drank any, she not liking 
any strong Liquors. After this, she told me, her Brother was very    #
ill of his Journey, being lately 
come out of the Country, tho' I don't understand he was in't. The    #
(^Munday^) before (^Michaelmas^) Day 
we were at Dinner with two more than our Family, when Mrs.           #
(^Baynton^) said, she had an Interest in a 
(^Norway^) Ship, and invited us all Aboard; but he, (^ (\viz.\) ^)   #
Mr. (^Swendsen^) , did not come to our House till 
four Days after; but on (^Friday^) we concluded to go on             #
(^Saturday^) ; there were Eight of us in Company in all, 
Mrs. (^Rawlins^) , Mrs. (^Busby^) , I and my Daughter. and Mr.       #
(^Ball^) another Lodger, belonging to the Exchequer; 
we went, and had much Discourse; after having drank a Glass of Wine  #
the Cloth was laid, and the 
Master offered a Bowl of Punch; says Mr. (^Swendsen^) , (^Ladies, I  #
would please you all, and leave you all to 
your Liberties to drink what you please^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] Is this Person Mrs. (^Bayntons^) Brother?
   [$Mrs. (^Night.^) $] This is he that went for her Brother.
   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] Whereabouts is your House?
   [$ (^Nightingale,^) $] Near (^Tuttle-fields^) .
   [$Mr. (^Sol. Gen.^) $] This Mrs. (^Baynton^) came to you under    #
the Character of a Country Lady on a Law
Suit; do you understand that she was so?
   [$Mrs. (^Nightingale.^) $] My Lord, she said she came from the    #
(^Bath^) .
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] You misapprehend the Question, Do you         #
understand that her pretence was true or not?
   [$ (^Night.^) $] I enquired of several Persons who acquainted me  #
that the (^Bayntons^) lived in (^Wiltshire^) ; but it 
was not long before we began to suspect her, for there seemed to be  #
an extraordinary Love between 
her and (^Swendsen^) , more than is usual between Brother and        #
Sister. I said, Madam, I wonder you don't 
marry your Brother. She said, she thought that 'twas not lawful. I   #
said there was such a thing done 
in (^Westminster^) , of a Mans marrying two Sisters.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Pray call to mind what time it was that you   #
first gave notice to her that she should not 
continue in your Lodgings. [$ (^Night.^) $] When I first mistrusted  #
her, I gave notice of it in my Family; but we 
being all Women, and fearful of her, thought not fit to give her     #
warning till her Month was up; but 
before that, she came to me, and told me, and said, Mrs.             #
(^Nightingale^) , I have received a Letter from 
my Sister (^Baynton^) in the Country, which informs me, that the     #
Trustees will agree, and so I design to 
return when my Month is up, for this Town is very chargeable. Very   #
well said I, for I expect some 
Ladies very shortly. I went down to my Family and exprest my Joy to  #
them, and said, I was very 
glad Mrs. (^Baynton^) had prevented me, for if she had not given me  #
warning, I would have given her 
Warning, for I resolved she should not stay.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Nightingale^) , it seems you had       #
notice of Mrs. (^Bayntons^) ill Carriages; Did you take any 
notice of it to her self? [$ (^Night.^) $] No, I did not, but I gave #
the Maid notice as soon as I suspected any 
thing. [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Do you know whether the Maid had told any #
thing to her or not? [$ (^Night.^) $] The 
Maid said to her, Madam, Don't you see a strangeness in the Family?  #
Yes, said she, I can see and 
bear a great deal, but when I am rouzed I'll be like a Lion.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] How long was this before Mrs. (^Rawlins^) was #
taken away?
   [$ (^Night.^) $] I can't prefix the time, but it was before she   #
gave me warning.
   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] Was she gone from your House before this    #
thing happen'd.
   [$ (^Night.^) $] No, my Lord, she told me on (^Wednesday^) that   #
her time was out; but said, there is a Fellow 
in Town that I fear will cheat me, and I am taking out a Statute of  #
Bankrupcy against him, which I 
think will cause me to stay in Town a Week longer; she also told me, #
she had taken a place in the 
Coach to go on (^Thursday^) , but must lose her Earnest, for this    #
Business would detain her a 
Week longer.
   [$Mr. (^Raymond.^) $] Did you ever observe they were together in  #
private?
   [$ (^Night.^) $] No, my Lord, we never had any suspition of Mr.   #
(^Swendsen^) , but of the Woman; for she could 
put on all manner of Disguises.
[$ (^Mrs.^) Busby (^being called she is Sworn^) .$]
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Busby^) , pray do you know Mrs.        #
(^Rawlins^) ?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] Yes, I do.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] How came you first acquainted with her?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] My Brother (^Busby^) was one of her Guardians,   #
and put her under the Care of my Husband, 
while he was living, which was four Years ago this (^Christmas^) .   #
She came to us by the consent of her 
Guardian.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] At what place did you Lodg?
   [$Mrs. (^Busby.^) $] We lived in (^Stretton-Grounds^) , but since #
my Husband died, which is three Years last (^July^) ,
I left House-keeping, and then we went and lodg'd at Mrs.            #
(^Nightingale's^) .
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] How long have you continued at Mrs.           #
(^Nightingales^) ?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] We have continued there ever since.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Do you know Mrs. (^Baynton^) ?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] Yes, I do, she lodg'd at Mrs. (^Nightingales^) .
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Was there any body who used to come to her    #
there?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] None except a (^Change^) Woman.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] Do you know any thing of Mr. (^Swendsen^) ?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] Sir, The first of his coming to Mrs.             #
(^Nightingales^) was the Day after (^Michaelmas^) Day. Mrs. 
(^Baynton^) said, that she had a Brother that was to come to Town,   #
which he did the Day after, with two 
Gentlewomen, which I never saw, either before or since; but Mr.      #
(^Swendsen^) after this came several times 
to her as her Brother, her Sisters Husband, and she desired that he  #
might Dine with her sometimes; 
for which she agreed with Mrs. (^Nightingale^) at 12 (^d.^) (^per^)  #
Meal.
<P 5>
   [$ (^Sol. G.^) $] Was this Mrs (^Rawlins^) at any time in private #
with (^Swendsen^) ?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] Never that I know of in all my Life, we were     #
always in Company together when 
he Dined there, and the times that he Dined there, we computed to be #
9 or 10, he was there 
sometimes when we were not at home.
   [$ (^Sol G.^) $] How did Mrs (^Baynton^) behave her self when she #
was at Mrs (^Nightingales^) ?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] We thought very well of her, till at last we     #
discerned too much freedom between Mr. 
(^Swendsen^) and her self, we suspected her Vertue, and thought she  #
would Drink, and were informed 
she would Swear, she said she must stay in Town about a month or 6   #
weeks about a Suit of Law,
her Maid told her of the strangeness of the Family, she said they    #
had best be Civil, or else she 
would stay and plague them. She told (^Mrs Nightingale^) at length   #
the Town was chargeable, and 
her Business done, and that she would return into the Country.
   [$ (^Sol. G.^) $] What do you know concerning (^Mrs Rawlins^)     # 
being taken away?
   [$ (^Mrs Busby.^) $] Mrs (^Baynton^) knowing it was our custom to #
go to (^Oxenden Chappel^) , every (^Friday^) 
morning, she came and told us she had occasion to go to (^Golden     #
Square^) , and that being in the 
way, she invited us to go with her in the Coach, and she would set   #
us down at or near the 
Chappel. When we came to (^Dartmouth street^) , somebody bid the     #
Coach man stop, I expected she 
should set us down as she promised, on that side where I sat there   #
were old Buildings and as I was 
looking out, I heard Mrs (^Baynton^) cry out to the Coach man drive  #
on, and all of a sudden I saw a 
man in the Coach, which was (^Hartwel^) the Bayliff, Mrs (^Rawlins^) #
and I were in a very great fright 
knowing nothing: I said for God's sake let's come out, we are not    #
concerned, (^Hartwel^) said we 
were the persons that he came for, I begg'd of him to let us come    #
out, (^Hartwel^) had his Arms
about Mrs (^Rawlins's^) side, and said, 'tis this Lady and you that  #
I am concerned about. I ask'd him 
what it was, said he, let you and I have two or three words          #
together, and all will be well 
enough. I said, you don't think I will say any thing to you, unless  #
I have my Friends by me, Mrs
(^Baynton^) in the Coach, said no Madam be sure                      #
[^SOURCE TEXT: besure^] you don't. I could    
not tell what he would do with 
us, at length he carried us all to the Star and Garter Tavern in     #
(^Drury Lane^) , I press'd him to let 
us go to (^Fleetstreet^) , for I had Friends there. (^Hartwel^) was  #
very angry, and would hear nothing of 
it, when we came to (^Drury Lane^) , Mrs (^Baynton^) wou'd have had  #
us put on our Masks. I said I had 
done nothing amiss, and I wou'd not; when we were in the Room at the #
Tavern, Mrs (^Baynton^) 
hastn'd out of the Room as fast as she cou'd pretending to go for my #
Friends, Mrs (^Rawlins^) and I 
were in a great consternation, wondring what they would do with us,  #
I took hold of her Arm 
and told her I would live and dye with her. The Bayliffs came in and #
said she was their Prisoner,
and took her by violence from me, they told me she must go with      #
them, for they said she was 
Arrested by a Writ out of one Court, and I by one out of another,    #
when she was going I put my 
Head out of the Window, and cry'd Murder, Murder several times, when #
I pull'd in my Head
again, (^Spurr^) said what have you got by your Bawling, and said    #
they were better known there then 
I, they brought a Man to me who said he had Orders to keep me, and   #
that he had only a Crown 
for his pains, but he would not suffer me to send for any body. The  #
Gentlewoman of the House 
came up, and said I had done a diskindness to her House by crying    #
out Murder, she said to me 
look and see whether your Name be spelt right, for it may be a false #
Arrest, (^&c.^) (^Wakeman^) that 
went away with Mrs (^Rawlins^) came back again, and said the young   #
Woman was well, and that he 
left her eating Fowl and Bacon, I said I wish she was well. The      #
Gentlewoman of the House 
bid the Bayliff shew me the Writ, he said he cou'd not read well,    #
but there was the name of 
(^Sabina Busby^) at the Suit of one (^Jones^) , but when he heard my #
complaints a considerable while, he 
said he would go to my Friends, and would go as cheap as a Porter    #
and as soon. I sent him to 
Mr (^Thornton^) and Mr (^Nash^) , he pretended to go but return'd no #
more till night.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] You said you cry'd out Murther, how did Mrs   #
(^Rawlins^) behave her self then?
   [$Mrs (^Busby.^) $] It was her great fright and crying that made  #
me endeavour her rescue, when we 
said we wou'd dye together, then it was when they forc'd her from    #
me, the surprize was so great 
that made me cry out after that manner that I did, upon which some   #
Neighbours came in, but 
they told them it was an Arrest, and therefore they wou'd not meddle #
in it.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Mrs (^Busby^) , they kept you till night you  #
say, did they take or require Bail for you 
before you was discharged.
   [$Mrs (^Busby.^) $] I'll tell you Sir, if you please, I did not   #
know what I was Arrested for, it might be 
Murder or Treason for ought I knew, there was a little Boy by, said  #
Madam I know Mr (^Unkle^) ,
your Friend in (^Newmarket^) , and I'll go for him, he went, but     #
when he return'd again, he said he 
was not at home, which I thought was a lye, there was a poor man a   #
Labourer working in the 
Chimney, he gave me a whink, and said Madam I'll go for him; but I   #
said to him pray don't leave 
me, I began to be affraid, for I did not know how my life might be   #
concern'd. Said the little, 
Boy I'll go any where for you, I sent him for two Gentlemen who      #
came, the Bayliffs said they had 
an Action of 200 (^l^) against me, the Gentlemen told the Bayliffs   #
they were come to bail me. The
Bayliffs were very impudent, but shuffl'd about, a while and left me #
and took no further notice.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did they take any Bail for you.
   [$Mrs (^Busby.^) $] No they left me with these Gentlemen
   [$Mr (^Mount.^) $] When you went out in the Morning, did you      #
design to go any where else but to 
Chappel.
   [$Mrs (^Busby.^) $] No where else.
   [$Mr (^Mount.^) $] Was it your invitation to Mrs (^Baynton^) , or #
her invitation to you to go in the Coach.
   [$Mrs (^Busby.^) $] It was Mrs. (^Baynton's^) invitation to me, I #
had not a very good opinion of Mrs (^Baynton^) 
for we suspected her Virtue in the Family, by reason of her too      #
familiar carriage to her Brother, 
but being to go shortly away, I apprehended no harm.
   [$Mr. (^Mount.^) $] Did Mrs (^Rawlins^) go with you.
   [$Mrs (^Busby.^) $] She did.
   [$Mr (^Mount.^) $] Mrs (^Busby^) , do you know the Prisoner, is   #
this the Man that came to Mrs (^Nightingales^) 
House.
   [$Mrs (^Busby.^) $] Yes Sir.
   [$ (^Judge Powel.^) $] How long was it from the time that you     #
were parted after Arresting, that you 
saw Mrs (^Rawlins^) again.
<P 6>
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] The first time after was on (^Saturday^) , when  #
they were before the Recorder.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J.^) $] When did you find her. [$ (^Busby.^) $] On    #
(^Saturday^) in the Afternoon.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J.^) $] Was you at the finding? [$ (^Busby.^) $] No   #
my Lord. [$ (^L. Ch. J.^) $] What time was it
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] About Noon I believe.
   [$ (^Mountague.^) $] When you saw her put into the Coach, did you # 
hear her cry out?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] No Sir, it was I that cry'd out.
   [$ (^Mountague.^) $] Did Mr. (^Swendsen^) make any entertainments #
or no?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] But one as I know of. [$ (^Swendsen.^) Speaks to #
Mrs (^Busby^) , and said$] have you done,
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] I think so.
   [$ (^Swendsen.^) $] If you have, I'll ask you a question, did you #
know of any Love between Mrs (^Rawlins^) 
and me.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J.^) $] Did you know any thing of Love between Mrs    #
(^Rawlins^) and the Prisoner or no?
   [$ (^Busby.^) $] No my Lord. [$ (^Mrs.^) Bayntons (^Maid called   #
and Sworn^) .$]
   [$ (^Sol. G.^) $] Pray did you know (^Mrs Baynton^) ?             #
[$ (^Maid.^) $] Yes. [$ (^Sol. G.^) $] Was you her Servant?
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] Yes, Sir. [$ (^Sol. G.^) $] Who recommended you   #
to her? [$ (^Maid.^) $] Mrs (^St John^) .
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Do you know one Mr (^Swendsen^) ?             #
[^MAID ANSWERS.^] Yes, my Lord, there he is, [$pointing to him.$]
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Did you ever see him before you were hired to #
your Mistress. [$Maid,$] no my Lord, I 
never saw him before. [$ (^S. G.^) $] Did you see him, when you was  #
with your Mrs. [$ (^Maid.^) $] Yes my Lord.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Do you know whether there was any Relation    #
between them?
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] Yes, my Lord, they went for Brother and Sister.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] How long was you with her. [$ (^Ans.^) $]     #
About a Month. [$ (^S. G.^) $] How did she behave her self?
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Till the last of her time, very well, but the      #
Family had a mistrust of her long before she 
went away. [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Do you know the Reason why they       #
mistrusted her?
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] I do not know my Lord.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Do you know what was the cause the Family     #
mistrusted her?
   [$ (^The Maid.^) $] They thought her a loose sort of a Woman and  #
therefore they mistrusted her.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J.^) $] Did they discern any Familiarity betwixt them?
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] No more than as Brother and Sister.

on (^Wednesday^) before they were Arrested, 
(^Mr Hartwel^) , was at my House to see for me, but being not at     #
home, but in the Country, I came 
home about a 11 at Night, My Daughter said to me there was a VVrit   #
left by (^Mr Hartwel^) for me 
to be served and it must be done to morrow morning, on the morning   #
he came to me and said (^Mr

and called for a Pot of Ale
and a Bottle of VVhite VVine, and we had a Toast and some Cheese,    #
while I was there one (^Mr^) 
<P 7>

   [$ (^Wakeman:^) $] (^Thursday^) , he [^she IN SOURCE TEXT,        #
REVISED BY HAND^] appointed me to call upon him at 9 next morn. He   #
said if I came 
first we shou'd get what we had before, he came in before we had     #
done, and the man of the 
House was dressing himself in the Kitchin; we eat a Tost, and drank  #
the VVine, and after that 
we had another. (^Mr Holt^) call'd (^Mr Hartwel^) out, and said it   #
cannot be done, by and by he said 
it might be done, I don't know what it was, but they took me to      #
(^Stretton^) street, (^Mr Hartwel^) and 
(^Mr Spurr^) was with me, I was asham'd to stand in the street, so I #
went into
an Alehouse, and drank a single pot of drink.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Had you seen (^Mr Swendsen^) before that      #
morning? [$ (^Ans.^) $] No,
I never saw him before in all my life; At that, if't please your     #
Honour, (^Mr Hartwel^) and (^Mr 
Spurr^) went before, and bid me follow the Coach, I did so as near   #
as I cou'd, but cou'd not keep 
pase with the Coach, being lame, but at (^Dartmouth^) Ground (^Mr    #
Spurr^) stopp'd the Horses, and 
then I came up to the Coach, and (^Mr Hartwel^) I suppose gave the   #
word of Arrest, and into the 
Coach he went, but I did not go in because there was no room, but    #
rid behind it; the Coach 
was order'd to go to the Star and Garter Tavern in (^Drury-Lane^) ,  #
when we came there we went 
into a back room, and the Gentlewoman that had a Band-box said to    #
(^Mrs Rawlins^) I will go to 
some of your Friends.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] VVhat did they do in (^Stretton^) Grounds?
   [$ (^Wakeman.^) $] They were Arrested there, the Gentlewoman was  #
carry'd by (^Mr Hartwell^) to his 
House, and I follow'd them, but meeting with a Gentlewoman of my     #
acquaintance, she stopp'd 
me, when I came to (^Hartwel's^) House, where is she said I, they    #
told me she was below Stairs, I 
said I had a little business elsewhere that will detain me about an  #
hour, he gave me leave to go; 
VVhen I went out (^Mr Holt^) call'd me over the way, and ask'd me if #
(^Mr Hartwell^) was at home, I 
said yes, and is the young Gentlewoman there to? I likewise said     #
yes. He led me to the 5 Bells in 
(^Witch^) street; into a room where there were three boxes, and      #
carry'd me to the middlemost box, 
and there was a Gentleman.

Holt^) came into the room two or three times, then Mr (^Holt^) told  #
me I was discharg'd of my Prisoner, 
so away I went.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You were eating Stakes you say at the Vine     #
Tavern, was she there then?
   [$ (^Wakeman.^) $] There is a Court against the Tavern, and I saw #
the Gentlewoman looking out of the 
Vine Tavern, where there were new Sash windows, as I came over the   #
way thro the Court this 
Gentlewoman look'd out of the Window.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] VVhat, before you went in?
   [$ (^Wakeman.^) $] Yes my Lord, but I went in and saw him alone,  #
but knew not whom he was.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you see (^Mrs Rawlins^) there?             #
[$ (^Wakeman.^) $] No not at the Tavern.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] VVhen (^Hartwel^) took away this Gentlewoman, #
did she go away quietly, or did (^Mrs 
Busby^) and she make any outcry? [$ (^Wakeman^) $] She was a little  #
frighted.

[$ (^Wakeman^) $] about an hour and qr after.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] What answer did you give when they ask'd you      #
where the Gentlewoman was?
   [$ (^Wake.^) $] I said she was at (^Mr Hartwells^) .

had you no Process against (^Mrs Busby^) ?
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] No, none at all. [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] On what        #
account did you keep (^Mrs Busby^) ?
   [$ (^Wakeman.^) $] I did not keep her, but one (^Spurr^) was      #
employed to do it.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] You came back to (^Mrs Busbys^) did not you say   #
that you had been with the young 
Gentlewoman, who was eating Fowls and Bacon? [$ (^Ans.^) $] (^Mr     #
Hartwel^) ask'd me to eat some.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] Did not you shew (^Mrs Busby^) a Writ and read it #
to her?
   [$ (^Wakeman^) $] I cou'd never read a King's Bench Writ.         #
[$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Can you read a Marshals Court Writ? 
   [$ (^Wake.^) $] Yes but not the Latin of it. [$ (^Coun.^) $] When #
you went to (^Hartwel^) at the Vine Tavern did you
ask for (^Mrs Rawlins^) . [$ (^Wakeman.^) $] Yes, Yes, I ask'd where #
she was They told me they were
making an end of it. My Lord I had like to have forgot, I asked      #
where was the Prisoner and (^Mr

[$ (^Mrs Pleasant Rawlins^) Sworn$]
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Give an account to his Lordship after what    #
manner you were Arrested and carried 
from Tavern to Tavern.
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] My Lord I was Arrested with Madam (^Busby^) and   #
carried to the Star and Garter Tavern 
in (^Drury-lane^) . [$ (^L. C. J,^) $] How were you carried thither?
   [$ (^Mrs Rawlins.^) $] I was in a Coach going to (^Oxenden        #
Chappel^) , when 3 Bayliffs were about the Coach.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen^) $] Where did they carry you? [$ (^Raw.^) $] They  #
carried us to the Star and Garter in (^Drury-lane^) . 
   [$ (^S. G.:^) $] Who did they carry with you?                     #
[^RAWLINS ANSWERS.^] There was (^Mrs Busby^) , (^Mrs Baynton^) and   #
I, and (^Hartwel^) the 
Bayliff, when we came to the Star and Garter they forced me up       #
Stairs [^SOURCE TEXT: Sta rs^] into a Back Room, but we 
got into a forward room, but we had not been there long till they    #
parted (^Mrs Busby^) and I; (^Mrs 
Baynton^) was gone, for our Friends as she pretended. I was in a     #
very great Fright, but (^Mrs Busby^) 
saying we will dye [^SOURCE TEXT: "y" IN "dye" VERY FAINT^] together #
they took me by force from her; (^Hartwel^) swore a great Oath and   #
thrust 
me down Stairs and forced me out of a Back-door into an Alley, when  #
he went to put me into 
<P 8>
a Coach I cry'd out Murder, then he threatn'd to put me into         #
(^Newgate^) , he carry'd me to his House, 
and no body came to help me a great while, but (^Mrs Baynton^) said  #
that as she was going by the 
Door she heard my Name, and came in, in a mighty Fright; she said to #
me Madam I pity you, 
will no body Bail you? she told me I will send to my Brother who     #
shall be Bail for you, she sent 
for him, he came into the Room, and he said what is the matter with  #
you, I said enough is the 
matter when I am Arrested for 200 (^l.^) and owe no man a penny.     #
Said he in a Jacose way what 
makes you affrighted at that, I have a good mind to Arrest you my    #
self. Then they took me 
thence to the Vine Tavern in (^Holborn^) , where I was an hour or    #
two before I heard any thing of 
Marrying or any such thing.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] What did they do with you all that time?
   [$ (^Mrs Rawlins.^) $] They got a Dinner ready, and after we had  #
Dined, she begged of me to have 
her Brother, and said that if I did not marry him, I should be       #
ruined, I told her I would do 
nothing without the advice of my Friends. I desired my Friends to be #
sent for, but they would not 
admit it. She looked on my Ring on my Finger, and said let me see    #
your Ring from your Finger. 
I said no, you shall not. She said I will force it off. I said I'll  #
try that, but she forced it from me.
   [$ (^Swendsen.^) $] Remember you are upon your Oath.              #
[$ (^Mrs Rawlins.^) $] I know I am. When she 
took my Ring away, I askt her what she would do with it, she said    #
she should go and get a 
Wedding Ring made by it. I told her I would not marry without the    #
advice of my Friends. 
Away she went and bought a Ring, and came up again and said to her   #
Brother, she had a Ring; 
well said I give me my Ring and do what you will with the other; she #
said if I did not marry her
Brother I should be ruined for ever.
   There was a Minister in the House, whom they said had been there  #
about a quarter of an hour but 
I supposed longer, they brought him with the Clerk up Stairs; the    #
Parson saying I hear there is 
a couple to be married, he asked no Questions, but told me if I did  #
not marry this Gentleman, I 
should be sent to (^Newgate^) and ruined for ever.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] Give an account of what was after buying the Ring.
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] When they brought the Ring, they said to me will  #
you be marryed or no? I answered I 
will not, there are none of my Friends here, and I will not marry    #
without the consent of my Friends
they said if I did not I should be ruined for ever, so with many     #
Threats and Perswasions, they at 
last prevail'd with me to marry. I was forced to marry him out of    #
Fear, not of going to (^Newgate^) ,
but of being murdered.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] Where did they carry you? [$ (^Raw.^) $] To       #
(^Blakes^) House in (^Red Lyon-street^) , (^Holbourn^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What time of the day was it?                   #
[$ (^Mrs Rawlins.^) $] I cannot give an exact account; but I 
think it was Candle-light.
   [$ (^Swendsen.^) $] It was about 12 a Clock at noon.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What time was it that you were marry'd?        #
[$ (^Mrs Rawlins.^) $] My Lord it was about 3 a 
Clock.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] When you went to (^Blakes^) house, who was     #
with you there?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] None but Mr (^Swendsen^) , Mrs (^Baynton^) and I.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was there any Force or Threats us'd when you   #
were at (^Blakes^) House?
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Yes, there was my Lord. [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Give an #
account of it.
   [$ (^Rawlins.^) $] They thrust me up Stairs, and order'd to have  #
a Bed sheeted. Mrs (^Baynton^) said to me 
undress and go to Bed. I said I wou'd not. She said she wou'd pluck  #
my Cloaths off my back. I 
said she shou'd not. She told me she wou'd pluck off my Cloaths and  #
make me go to Bed.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] What did she do with you? [$ (^Ans.^) $] She put  #
me to Bed. [$ (^Coun^) $] Did she use any violence 
with you? [$ (^Ans.^) $] Such violence that made me go to Bed.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How came you to be released?                   #
[$Mrs (^Rawlins.^) $] It was [^was REPEATED TWICE IN SOURCE TEXT^]   #
(^Saturday^) morning 
before I was releas'd, there was some of my Friends came to the      #
place where I was.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Then you were with him all night?              #
[$ (^Raw.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr (^Swendson^) will you ask her any Questions?
   [$ (^Swendson.^) $] She must be my chiefest Evidence my Lord,     #
when the Witnesses come she must be the 
chiefest of them. [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You will not ask her any        #
Questions now, but when the Witnesses are call'd
   [$ (^Swendson.^) $] My Lord I presume she does not go out of the  #
Court. [$Orders given for her to sit down.$]
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] We have done with our Evidences at present.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr (^Swendson^) What do you answer to the      #
Evidence.
   [$ (^Swendsen.^) $] My Lord I am very much unprepar'd             #
[^APOSTROPHE VERY FAINT IN SOURCE TEXT^] for a Tryal at present.     #
[$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Why so?
   [$ (^Swend.^) $] Because I had but little time for preparation,   #
and I am not prepar'd, I desire that I may 
be allow'd Council.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] No, no, it cannot be allow'd you, and as for   #
the time of your Tryal you were told, 
if you would shew good cause to have it put off yet, the Court would #
have done it.
   [$ (^Swendson.^) $] Then I hope if I speak any thing that may be  #
prejudicial to my Cause, that the Court 
will not take advantage from it.
   The first time I was at Mrs (^Nightingales^) , I was desired by   #
Mrs (^Busby^) and Mrs (^Baynton^) to make a 
Bowl of Punch, which I did, and we were very Merry over it, then I   #
invited them to go on Board 
a Ship, which they all did, and we in a short time came very well    #
acquainted. My Lord, I desire 
my Wife might stand by her self, and none of them near her.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] There is none near her that will hurt her.
   [$ (^Swen.^) $] My Lord I beg she may stand by her self, that I   #
may have a fair Tryal, I pray your Lordship 
to grant me this favour. My Lord will you please to grant it?        #
[$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Must I grant it only for 
your humour? [$ (^Swen.^) $] 'Tis not a humour, my Lord, but of a    #
great consequence to me, will your 
Lordship grant me it? I beg it, my Lord, for 'tis the most material  #
thing I have to ask, I beg all 
those people may be removed from her, 'tis the greatest and most     #
material thing I have to say.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] I'm sorry for it? [$ (^Swen.^) $] It is so,    #
good my Lord grant me that.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] There's no body near her, that concerns you at #
all. [$ (^Swen.^) $] There are those by her that 
will do me no kindness. [$Then she is ordered to be removed.$]
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] My Lord her standing there is enough to       #
disorder her. [$ (^Swen.^) $] My Lord she is very well.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Remove her a little further. [$ (^Coun.^) $]   #
My Lord he does on purpose to fright her.
<P 9>
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] We went (as I was telling your Lordship)      #
aboard a Ship, and they invited me to come 
the Week following to partake of a Treat, accordingly I went, and    #
there was one Mr. (^Pugh^) , and he 
and I made a Bowl of Punch. Mr. (^Pugh^) at that time Courted Mrs.   #
(^Rawlins^) , and that little time I 
was acquainted with her I discerned she had a Kindness for me, as I  #
had for her; I told her I could not 
be easie while she suffred Mr. (^Pugh^) to Kiss her; she desired me  #
to be easie and it should be 
remedied.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mrs. (^Rawlins^) . Do you remember any such    #
thing?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] My Lord, I do not remember any such thing, or     #
that any such Words ever came out of my 
Mouth.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Did not you say this Mrs. (^Rawlins^) , Mrs.  #
(^Swendsen^) I should say, did not you say, If I would 
not sit by you you would not eat a bit or a crumb; when I sat by you #
and proffered my place to 
another, can you say you were not offended?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] No, I was not.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Are not you upon your Oath, did not you give  #
me some Encouragement?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] I do not know how I could shew it you, I know not #
of any such thing.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You ought to speak the truth because his Life  #
depends upon it. Did you in the first 
place ever admit of his Courtship in order to Marry you?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] No, my Lord, I don't remember any such thing.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you ever shew any kindness to him upon any #
such account?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] No, I don't know I shew'd him any more kindness   # 
than all the rest of the Family shewed 
him.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was you ever in his Company alone.
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] To give me more Ease and Satisfaction after   #
Dinner we had our Bowl and Walnuts, Mrs. 
(^Swendsen^) pilled the Kernels and gave them to me; she gave them   #
faster than I could eat; she heaped 
my Plate with them, every one at the Table took notice of it, and    #
she jogged me with her Knee, that I 
should take them, and gave some to Mrs. (^Baynton^) , and bid her    #
take them and give to me.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mrs. (^Busby^) , Were you there?

please to ask her your self?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mrs. (^Rawlins^) , did you e'er give pilled    #
Walnuts to him, or send them to him in particuler?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] No, my Lord, I do not know that I was more kind   #
to him than the rest of the 
Company.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Every Body took notice of it, and Mr (^Pugh^) #
in particular.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What do you say Mr. (^Swendsen^) ?
   [$ (^Swendsen,^) $] My Lord, Mr (^Pugh^) if he were here would    #
say the same as I do. He was afraid I should 
get away his Lady.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Where is he?
   [$ (^Court,^) $] He is in the Court.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You may have him for a Witness if you will
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] More than this, before he went away she told  #
him she did not care for him; this she spoke 
to make me more easie still: This I believe Mr. (^Pugh^) can         #
Witness, in as much as Madam (^Busby^) 
complain'd to her about it, at Mr. (^Scoreman's^) the Picture        #
Drawers, who is one of my Evidences, I desire 
he may be called.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Well, let him be called. 
[$So he was call'd and came.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Hear ye, he calls you to be a Witness, you are #
not to be upon your Oath, but are under 
the highest Obligation to tell the Truth.
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] While I was drawing a Gentlewomans Picture,   #
Mrs. (^Baynton's^) , there was a Fire, it 
began to be Cold, they fell into Discourse about Mr. (^Swendsen^)    #
and Mrs. (^Rawlins^) ; Mrs. (^Busby^) was there 
at the same time, they fell into Discourse about Mr. (^Swendsen^)    #
and the young Lady.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was she there?
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Where was it?
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] At my Lodgings, there were Mrs. (^Busby^) ,   #
the young Lady, and Mrs. 
(^Baynton^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Whose Picture were you drawing?
   [$ (^Scoreman.^) $] Mrs. (^Baynton's^) , They fell into Discourse #
relating to a matter of Love, 
between Mr. (^Swendsen^) and the young Lady. She said the young Lady #
had a Love for Mr. 
(^Swendsen^) , more than the other.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You heard her say so?
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] No, but I can say Mrs. (^Baynton^) said so.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] But tell us what you heard.
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] She should have said so, I did not hear her   #
my self, but afterwards upon a 
Discourse she said afterwards, what she had said she would stand to.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did she say?
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] I do not know that she said so or not.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] My Lord, may I speak it as well as I can, he  #
cannot speak (^English^) right, 
I'll speak it to him, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] No, no. Did you hear Mrs. (^Busby^) say any    #
thing? What did she say?
<P 10>
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] In way of Discourse she said so.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What, in way of Discourse, did she say nothing?
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] I heard the Lady only say that Word, that     #
all she had said she would 
stand to.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did you hear them talk about?
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] They were playing at Cards, and she took up   #
the Tricks of Mr. (^Swendsen^) ,
which discovered Love.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] The Question is, whether you did hear them     #
speak any thing of Love, or 
not?
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] My Lord, he would speak better with an        #
Interpreter.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Let an Interpreter be called for.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What Country-man are you?
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] My Lord, he is a (^Dane^) .
   [$The Interpreter, a Jury-man, was sworn, and beginning to talk   #
with (^Scoreman^) , and 
he then said,$] he's none of my Country, he is a (^Dutch-man^)       #
[^NO ITALICS IN SOURCE TEXT FOR man^] , I don't understand 
him.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] He speaks (^English^) well enough.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Very well, but he knows not where he begins,  #
he would say what Mrs 
(^Busby^) and Mrs. (^Baynton^) were speaking, but knows not how to   #
utter himself.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] He cannot say any thing for you.
   [$ (^Scoreman,^) $] I heard but a few Words, and cannot say much  #
of it.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You must have a better Witness, or you are in  #
a dangerous 
Condition.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] My Lord, Mr (^Pugh^) complained to Madam      #
(^Busby^) , that she slighted him 
very much.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What, for Love of you?
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Yes, my Lord, I could tell you of divers      #
things that pass between Lovers, that 
would be impertinent for me to relate to wise Men.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Let us hear some of them.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] When we were by our selves, she kissed me,    #
and squeezed me by the Hand, 
when we walked privately in the Garden.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did she kiss you?
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Yes, My Lord and squeez'd me often.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you not think her very coming?
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Yes, I did, and when we talk'd of Marriage,   #
she seemed to be very well 
pleased.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mrs. (^Rawlins^) , you hear what he says. Did  #
you Squeeze him by the Hand, and 
Kiss him? Is it true?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] No, my Lord, I did no such trick, not I, and as   #
for walking in the Garden, I did 
not walk in the Garden alone with him.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] I could mention a great many of these little  #
things, but if she denies them I 
cannot help it. 
   My Lord, the last time I was at the House we had a Barrel of      #
Oysters. I stood 
with my Hands behind me, and as she passed by at any time, she gave  #
me Squeezes [^SOURCE TEXT: Squezees^] by 
the Hand.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What say you to this Mrs. (^Rawlins^) ?
   [$ (^Rawlings,^) $] My Lord, I did not do so upon my Oath.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] She says she did not do it upon her Oath.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Now for the Matter of Fact; as for the Arrest #
I never knew any thing of it 
directly or indirectly, till I saw her at the Bayliffs House.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] If she did know any thing of, or was           #
consenting to the Arrest, why did 
you force her to the Tavern, and Marry her with a Parson you had     #
provided for 
that purpose?
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] She Married me with as much Freedom as could  #
be in a Woman.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What say you to that Mrs.?
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Will your Lordship please to ask her whether  #
I offered any Violence to her 
either by Word or Deed.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mrs. (^Rawlins^) , give an Account how you     #
were carried from the Bayliffs 
House.
   [$ (^Rawlins,^) $] My Lord, when I was at (^Hartwell's^) the      #
Bayliffs House, Mrs. (^Baynton^) 
pretended to come accidentally by, and that she heard my Voice, and  #
came in, and said, (^How 
do you do Mrs.^) Rawlins? You know how I do, said I. She pretended   #
to help me, and 
proposed to go to her Brother to Bail me, and he came, and I was     #
carried from 
thence in a Coach to the (^Vine^) Tavern. -- [$She was asked whether #
he came into the 
Coach to her?$]
   [$ (^Rawlins,^) $] Yes, he did.
<P 11>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you cry out when they put you into the     #
Coach?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] No my Lord, I did not cry out then, I made no     #
noise then.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did he do then? [$ (^Rawl.^) $] They      #
carry'd me to the (^Vine-Tavern^) a Prisoner.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] She went willingly enough from (^Hartwel's^)  #
House to the (^Vine-Tavern^) , because she thought that 
there she should be bailed.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mrs. What was the pretence of your being       #
carried from (^Hartwel's^) House?
   [$ (^Rawl.^) $] My Lord, They would not tell me before they       #
carry'd me to the place.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr. (^Swendsen^) , Will you ask any other      #
Questions?
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Not yet, my Lord. I desire the Parson may be  #
called that Marry'd us. [$Which was done.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Come Dr. You are not upon your Oath; How come  #
you to be concern'd in this Match.
   [$ (^Parson.^) $] My Lord, It was at the (^Vine-Tavern^) where I  #
saw them in (^Holborn^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was it the (^Mitre^) , or the (^Vine^) ?       #
[$ (^Parson.^) $] The (^Vine^) , I believe, my Lord,
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How came you there?
   [$ (^Parson.^) $] There was a Gentleman fetch'd Me and the Clerk  #
from the (^Fleet^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What to do? [$ (^Parson.^) $] He said there    #
was a Gentleman there to speak with us; When
we came there, the Clerk and I went up one Pair of Stairs and Drank  #
a Pint of Wine. Then we were 
led into another Room, I asked him what I was to do. He told me for  #
to Marry him to that Young 
Gentlewoman.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was there a License? [$ (^Parson.^) $] Yes;    #
When I saw the License I read it, and saw it a 
true License; Then I asked the Gentlewoman her Name, to know whether #
it was the same that was in 
the License; and found it was the same.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was it Written in the License that the         #
Marriage was to be performed at the (^Vine-Tavern^) ?
   [$ (^Parson.^) $] No my Lord, But a Blank was left.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you take the Queen's Duty?                 #
[$ (^Parson.^) $] No my Lord, But returned their Names 
to the Supervisor; My Lord, when I asked her Name, I also asked her  #
whether she was willing to be 
Married. She said she was willing. And another Gentlewoman was with  #
her, that said she was her 
Sister: I said to her; Madam if you consent, and your Sister is      #
willing, here is a License, for I believe 
there is no danger to Marry you.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you ask her any other way than in your     #
Form, (^Will you have this Man to your Wedded 
Husband^) . [$ (^Parson.^) $] I ask'd her whether she was willing to #
Marry, she said yes, she was willing.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] But did you ask her before you did the Office?
   [$ (^Parson.^) $] Yes my Lord, I did, and she consented to it.
   [$ (^Counsel.^) $] Pray who was the Person that came to the       #
(^Fleet^) to you, to carry you to the (^Tavern^) , was it the 
Gentleman at the Bar? [$ (^Parson.^) $] No 'twas not him.
   [$Mr (^Mount.^) $] How long was it before you went to him, after  #
you went into the Tavern?
   [$ (^Parson.^) $] My Clerk and I went in, and sat the Drinking a  #
Pint of Wine, about a quarter of an Hour, 
then we went to the Gentleman.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do you think that they should grant Licenses   #
to Marry in a Tavern, and out of Canonical Hours?
   [$ (^Parson.^) $] I never did it in all my life before, and never #
will do it again.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] What was the Reason, why you were conducted   #
into another Room, and not where they were.
   [$ (^Parson.^) $] I know not the Reason.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] How long were you in the Room where they      #
were? [$ (^Parson.^) $] I cannot well tell.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you Marry them as soon as you came in?     #
[$ (^Parson.^) $] Almost as soon.
   [$ (^Mount.^) $] Did you ever Marry any at a Tavern before?       #
[$ (^Parson.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Will your Lordship be pleased to hear the     #
License read.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] It may be read. [^THE FOLLOWING SPEECH IS      #
UNLIKELY TO BE THAT OF L. C. J., POSSIBLY SOL. GEN. OR PARSON.^] You #
may see the Date and the Names. The License is Dated (^Oct.^) 14.    #

The Names (^Haagen Swendsen^) in the Parish of St. (^Paul's^)        #
(^Shadwell^) ; and (^Pleasant Rawlins^) in the Parish of St. 
(^Mary^) (^White-Chappel^) . [$ (^Counsel.^) $] Is there any Blank   #
left? [$ (^Parson.^) $] Yes there is a Blank left that 
the Marriage may be in the Parish Church of St. (^Mary^)             #
(^White-Chappell^) , (^ (\vel\) ^) a Blank. [^IN SOURCE TEXT A BLANK 
SPACE OF ABOUT 18 CHARACTERS PRECEDES "a Blank".^]
   [$ (^Monteg.^) $] Were you Entertained there? [$ (^Parson.^) $]   #
Before the Marriage the Clerk and I drank a Pint 
of Wine in the first Room. [$ (^Mountag.^) $] Had you any Victuals   #
then?
   [$ (^Parson.^) $] Not before they Married; but after.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Pray Sir, Did you bespeak a Dinner before the #
Marriage? [^PARSON ANSWERS.^] No Sir, the Gentleman bespoke a 
Fowl. [$Mr. (^Dan. Cotchett^) , was called.$]
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] My Lord, I desire he may be asked whether he  #
heard any Noise, or whether any violence 
was offered to the Young Woman?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you hear any Noise, or perceive any        #
Violence offered to the Young Woman.
   [$ (^Cotchett.^) $] No my Lord. [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Ask Mrs.      #
(^Cotchett^) whether any Noise or Violence was 
offer'd to the Young Lady? 
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] I'le ask her that Question. Was there any      #
Noise, or Violence used to the Young Lady?
   [$Mrs. (^Cotchett.^) $] No my Lord, there was no Noise, they came #
in and asked for a Room, and I shew'd 
them a lower Room, but they would not have that, but went up, soon   #
after Mr. (^Holt^) the Vintner came 
down and went out, and Mr. (^Hartwel^) call'd for a Pint of Wine for #
the Coachman, but the Drawer 
Grumbled at it, and said he did not know who'd pay for't, then Mr.   #
(^Hartwel^) the Bayliff told me it was 
an Arrest, and that the Parson was to be Bail for the Lady, and at   #
that I very much wondred, and 
afterwards they told me there was a Wedding above, which we admired  #
at, that there should be a 
Wedding, and Bayliffs; And after all was over, the Gentleman and the #
Lady went out at the Back-Door, and 
took Coach. [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you see Mrs. (^Swendsen^)        #
discontented when she went out. No, my 
Lord, she seemed not Discontented; what I know I'll speak and no more.       
[$ (^Sarah Walker^) called.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do you live at the (^Vine Tavern^) ?           #
[$ (^Walker.^) $] Yes my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What Place? [$ (^Walker.^) $] Cook my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was you in the House when that Young           #
Gentlewoman was carried Prisoner there? Where 
were you then? [$ (^Walker.^) $] In the Bar, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you keep the Bar? [$ (^Walker.^) $] No, my #
Lord; but I was washing the Bar at that time.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you hear any Noise? [$ (^Walker.^) $] No,  #
my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you hear of a Wedding? [$ (^Walker.^) $]   #

say any thing for their Service?
<P 12>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What do you say to this? [$ (^Walker.^) $] My  #
Lord, only this, That if I knew any thing, and
discover'd it, I should be satisfied for my Trouble.

   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] When you came up into the Room, what          #
Condition was the Young Gentlewoman in?
   [$ (^Walker.^) $] She sat at one end of the Room and seemed to be #
very Melancholly.
   [$ (^Sol. Gen.^) $] How did she look when she went away?          #
[$ (^Walker.^) $] Not Melancholly then, when Orders 
were given about the Supper, I asked her what Sauce she would have,  #
she said she would eat nothing at 
all. [$Mr. (^Blake's^) Daughter being called.$]
