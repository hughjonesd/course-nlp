[$ (^Enter Lady^) Young Love, Wilmore.$]

   [$Lady (^Young.^) $] Bid the Coach set up, and let the things be  #
brought in
here My Daughter come! God bless you!
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] I am o'er joy'd to see your Ladiship, and to see   #
you look so
well.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Your Ladiships most humble Servant. [$ (^Salutes   #
her.^) $] 
   [$Lady (^Young.^) $] (^Belira^) , How do you like these figur'd   #
Velvets; this I
design for the Bed and Hangings; this Violet colour suits agreeably
with this Buff.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Most extreamly well, Madam; does your Ladiship     #
design a
Mixture?
<P 5>
   [$L. (^Young.^) $] I had thoughts of Paining and Bordering it with
this Crimson and Green; but that sort of Furniture has been my
aversion, ever since I saw my odious Lady (^Junkers^) Appartment
set forth with Scotch Plad and Damask.
   [$ (^Bel. aside.^) $] Confusion! How his Eyes are fix'd on her,   #
as if
his Soul received her Charms, and wanted pow'r to hide it!
   [$L. (^Young.^) $] I don't look well to day, Mr (^Wilmore^) .     #
[$ (^Looks in her 
Glass.^) $] 
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Your Ladiship can never look other.
   [$L. (^Young.^) $] (^Belira^) , thou won't flatter me; I have not #
red enough 
have I?
   [$ (^Mar. aside.^) $] But from the Eyes to the Chin, and looks    #
like the
Raddle upon a Sheep's Back.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Your Ladiship is mistaken, I never saw you look    #
better;
there's a Curl indeed out of order with the motion of the Coach;
Hold, incline your Head: So, very well, that Pink-colour'd 
Riband suits agreeably with your Complexion.
   [$L. (^Young.^) $] But do you really think, Mr (^Wilmore^) , I    #
look so well
to Day.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] He has reason to hope, Madam, that your Ladiship may
look better to morrow Night.
   [$L. (^Young.^) $] Have you catch'd hold of that report, who made
you so wise?
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Him that is to make your Ladiship so happy.
   [$L. (^Young.^) $] Indeed, indeed, Mr. (^Wilmore^) , it derogates #
from
you to talk with Girls: When I had a Mother, I durst never
think of approaching her without Fear and Trembling. Now
a Young thing as soon as ever she has bid farewell to Bibs and
Aprons, is ready for a Love, and thinks her self with Noise
and Impudence, better to be liked, than her Mother with all
her Experience.

[$ (^Enter Page.^) $] 

   [$ (^Page.^) $] Sir (^Rustick Goodheart^) desires to know if your #
Ladiship
be at leisure.
   [$L. (^Young.^) $] Always to him; I shall be glad of his Company
Daughter, I have taken that care of your Fortune, as deceives
not the Trust my late Lord reposed in me, Sir (^Rustick Good-heart^)
and I, have agreed upon your Marriage; my Authority secures
your Consent.
<P 6>
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Marriage, Madam, is a thing I have not thought on, #
yet
'tis a Journey for Life, and that once consider'd, we ought to do
every thing to make it as easie to us as possible.

[$ (^Enter Sir^) Rustick Good-Heart, Wildman.$] 

   [$L. (^Young.^) $] Sir (^Rustick^) , your Servant; where have you #
been since
dinner?
   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] Be Dad, taking a Glass to this pretty Lady's
health, Madam your Servant.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Your most humble Servant. [$ (^They salute        #
her.^) $] 
(^Wilmore^) , a very pretty Lady.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] I cou'd think so to, if 'twere not of the latest.
   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] Give me thy Hand sweet heart, thou'rt welcome
to Town, be Dad with all my heart.
   [$L. (^Young.^) $] What think you of a Walk in the Garden; the
Lovers are engag'd, and we wou'd leave them together.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] We wait upon you.
[$ (^Manet^) Sir Rustick (^and^) Mar$] 

   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] Which dost thou like best, my Dear, the Town,
or Country.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] The Town, Sir, beyond Comparison, all good Judges
are of my Opinion, I hope you are one of them.
   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] Before George not I, yet if it had not been #
for me 
you had been there still; I persuaded my Lady to send for you
up, and have provided a Husband for thee, Girl, what say'st
thou to a Husband, heigh.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] 'Tis a sort of Creature, has not yet fallen under my
Consideration.
   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] All in good time, Child; I like thee ne'er  #
the worse
for that. You don't look like the forward things of the Town,
that Marries a Man only to Cuckold him, Ods bobs thou wilt
not do that, I hope, Child.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] I don't understand you, Sir. 
   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] Come, we will be better acquainted, and     #
then thou
shalt understand me, heigh: to say truth, the way of making
Cuckolds is soon understood.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Pray, Sir, at once forgive, and satisfie my        #
curiosity; have
you spent your time mostly in the Town or Country.
<P 7>
   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] Be Dad, Child, the Country; I never came to
(^London^) but in times of Parliament, which thank Heaven were not
very frequent in our late Reigns; do I look like your Sickly
(^Londoners^) , the dregs of nothing but Pox and Wine, Hemh, --
Hemh, -- shew me any young Fellow of them all, that can match
me in Health and Vigour; neither Stone, nor Gout, nor the
relicts of any Distemper, but love of thee, Child.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Love of me, sure you mistake your self, one wou'd  #
have
imagin'd it, any other under the Sun at your Age.
   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] Why there, be dad you'r out, there's none   #
Lovers
but us old Fellows, the Young ones don't think it worth their
time; shew me such another as Old Sir (^Fair-Love Fondling^) ; 
why Child he does nothing but look Babies in her Eyes all day,
but bedad I believe he sees but in Imagination, unless he borrows
the assistance of Spectacles: He sets her, before George, in a great
Chair in the very middle of a Chamber, and himself for hours
together at her Feet, upon a Foot-stool, in admiration of her;
there's encouragement now.

[$ (^Enter^) Belira.$] 

   [$ (^Bel.^) $] My Lady (^Young-Love^) and her Counsel are in the  #
Parlor,
Sir, looking over the Writings, she desires your Company.
   [$Sir (^Rustick.^) $] I come, I come; Sweet Mistriss your         #
Servant, till
I see thee again.
[$ (^Exit^) Sir (^Rustick^) .$] 
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I came (^Marina^) to your deliverance, I imagin'd  #
how you
were teiz'd.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] O hideous! (^Belira^) , did I think in Nature,     #
there had been
such an ill bred, awkard thing; why he's so great a Monster
already, Horns can't make him worse.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] And yet my Lady (^Young-Love^) says you must Marry #
him.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] What with twelve thousand Pound, a great deal of
Youth, no contemptible stock of Beauty, besides an untainted
Reputation, that out-weighs them all; believe me, (^Belira^) , I'm not
so far ignorant of my own worth, to bury it in him.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I wish you don't ruine your self by the Refusal.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] That Marriage is the greatest, and you must use    #
all your
Interest with my Mother to prevent it; or resolve to make me
the most unhappy Creature breathing.
<P 8>
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] All aids that are in my power you may command: But
has not your Journey tir'd you, you will not be for the Park this
Evening.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] The Name has unweary'd me; I'll but change my      #
Cloaths [^SOURCE TEXT: Cloahts^]
and be ready for you.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] My Lady (^Young-Love^) has tir'd poor              #
(^Wilmore^) ; he has left
her to her Bonds and Conveyances, and is gone to the Park
before; wou'd not you wish to meet him there?
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Why thy question? He is my Mothers, and never can
be mine; but we trifle: will you favour me with your Company,
whilst I am Dressing?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I'll follow you.
[$ (^Exit.^) Marina.$] 
Yes, (^Marina^) , my Interest pulls too strong against you, to leave
you a Moment to your self till I have put it out of Fortunes
power to injure me,

(^Who trusts the fawning Jilt, must first believe,
I trust her not, and cannot be deceiv'd^) .
[$ (^Exit Omnes.^) $] 
<P 9>
[}ACT II. SCENE I.}]

[}ST. JAMES'S-PARK.}]

[$ (^Enter^) Smyrna (^and^) Olivia.$]

   [$ (^Smy.^) $] Pray, Gentlewoman be pleased to wear your Mask, till
we're got out of this Road of Foppery; I had better
have gone Ten Miles about.
   [$ (^Oliv.^) $] Lord, Mr. (^Smyrna^) , 'tis so hot, my Mask       #
stifles me; but
where are you going? I am sure Walking is not your Business,
especially in this place.
   [$ (^Smy.^) $] Yes, Wife, to chuse, that you may have the pleasure
of comparing your old damned Jealous Husband, to these Gay
stuttering Fops, that sail along by us; Here's your Gallant,
Mr. (^Wildman^) , coming, put on your Mask, I say; Not for the
World, I warrant you.

[$ (^Enter^) Wildman.$] 

   [$ (^Oliv.^) $] 'Tis too late, he has seen me, Husband, 'twill be
uncivil.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Mr. (^Smyrna^) , your Servant; The fair           #
(^Olivia^) here! Since
when is it, Sir, you have been so far reconciled to our Lewd
end of the World, to trust this Lady amongst us.
   [$ (^Smy.^) $] Hum, Sir, not too much of trusting neither, but yet,
as you say, 'tis a dangerous place, for an old Fellow, that has
an Handsom Wife; Have you not that Opinion of her, Mr.
(^Wildman^) ?
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] All the World must allow her that Character, but  #
Faith,
my Friendship to you, hinders me to think of her, as I would, if
she were not thy Wife.
   [$ (^Smy.^) $] And you, forsooth, Have not you a just Esteem of
Mr. (^Wildman's^) Merit?
<P 10>
   [$ (^Oliv.^) $] As I ought, I know my Duty to you, Husband, and   #
never
had a thought against it.
   [$ (^Smy.^) $] Why, very well, since you are both so indifferent, #
'twere
no great harm, if you never see one another again. As to you, 
Gentlewoman, 'tis Mortifying you too much, to suffer the Visits of
a Man, who has not Sense to know your Worth; And, let
me tell you, Mr. (^Wildman^) , I Love my Wife, and don't like
People that slight her Charms, and prefer my Friendship to
her Beauty, therefore till you come better prepared to do her
justice, your Visits will be but offensive, and if ever you make
another, I shall conclude you have taken a Friends Advice. Come,
Wife. [$ (^Ex. Smy.^) and (^Oliv.^) $] 
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Go thy ways, for an old Jealous, I wish be-gad, I #
could
say, Cuckold, but my honest Endeavours shall not be wanting to
make thee, that thou believest thy self.

[$ (^Enter^) Wilmore.$] 

   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Thank God for my deliverance, I'm got into the open
Air again, without the incumbrance of an old Woman, who is
not satisfied, unless you confine your Eyes to the Curse of meeting 
none but hers.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] If thou art weary already, what wilt thou be when #
the
Noose is fixt, and no kind relieving Hand can do thee the curtesy
of unslipping it.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] I confess, I have given the Town reason to         #
believe, I cou'd
allow (^May^) and (^December^) the two ends of time, to meet in our
expected Wedlock.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] The Opinion of thy Sense was not forfeited by     #
that, we
always believed, thou hadst enough to distinguish between the
glittering Metal and the Allay; But are you not resolved to Marry
my Lady (^Young-Love^) .
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] So far from it, that I wou'd run my self into any  #
other
Noose in (^Christendom^) , to avoid hers; (^Marina^) is the Goddess
here; You have doubtless heard her Father left her a Fortune
of 12000 (^l.^) on Condition she Married with my Lady (^Young-Love's^)
Consent, else Shame and Beggery to be her Portion.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] That any Man shou'd be so far wedded to the Follies
of his Wife to desire the entailing of them upon his Posterity.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] I have held a long Age of Dissimulation with her
Mother to permit her return to Town, and get her Fortune secured,
<P 11>
engaged my Father with the hopes of Marrying her, and
doubtless I shou'd prevail over the old Lady, if it were not for
another; but this is the hardest part of my Confession, for I think,
whatsoever Custom can persuade, that Man's a Villain, who
boasts a Lady's Favour.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Begad if our Town Ladies come to know how well
thou art principled, thou may'st e'en make thy own Markets
amongst them, 'tis not to be matched in thy green years, which
commonly reckons the pleasure of telling as the foremost delight
in an Amour.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] I am not Beaux enough for that yet. To be short    #
then,
(^Beliria^) who you know lives with, and governs my Lady 
(^Young-Love^) , did me the honour to like me, and I had reason to   #
believe
my self Master of her first Favours, I cou'd not shake off her
fondness, tho' all mine was secretly addrest to (^Marina^) , for     #
whose sake I
was forced to dissemble with (^Belira^) .
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Begad that was slavery enough, for the trouble of #
getting
handsomly rid of a Mistress, is ten times more than what it costs
to make her such.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] She catch'd the discovery from my Eyes, and        #
unknown to
(^Marina^) perswaded her Mother to send her into the Country, then
to confound me further, the old Lady grew fond of me, (^Belira^) 
putting it into her Head, that I wou'd Marry her, by which means, she
constantly secured her self of seeing me, being in the same House,
and reasonably thought, the interest she had in my Heart, ran no
hazard, by bestowing my Person upon an old Woman.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Then how comes it, she has suffered (^Marina^) to #
return,
for I perceive she manages at pleasure.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] 'Twas conditionally, I Married my Lady             #
(^Young-Love^) to
morrow, and consented that (^Marina^) should be bestowed upon my 
Father.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] And how do you think to evade either.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] 'Tis for that reason I make this discovery to      #
engage your
assistance, (^Belira^) will not suffer her to sign for her Daughters
Portion, till the moment of Execution, but my present uneasiness
is to entertain (^Marina^) , I have ordered Musick and Dancing after
Supper, if possible engage (^Belira^) in your Affairs, that she may  #
not
concern her self with mine.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] You have ordered your own without considering my
applications to (^Belira^) may ruine me with (^Orinda^) .
<P 12>
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Quite contrary, that Coquet never likes a Man so   #
well as
when he does not seem to be fond of her, trust my Opinion;
besides 'twere no Obligation if you did not run a little hazard for
your Friend.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] You shall command me, and now I consider, I'le    #
bring
Sir (^Amorous Courtall^) , who is Fop enough, to think all Women
that have fine Cloaths Beauties; him I design for the old Lady,
if she shou'd happen to like him 'twere no ill way of getting rid
of her.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] That will be admirable, but be sure ply            #
(^Beliria^) close,
she's handsom enough to reward your pains, and because of her
interest with my Lady (^Young-Love^) , the only Enemy I can
apprehend, -- They are come into the Walk, we'll meet them at
the next turn. [$ (^Ex. Wil. Wild.^) $] 

[$ (^Enter^) Marina (^and^) Belira; (^meeting^) Orinda (^they        #
salute^) .$] 

   [$ (^Ori.^) $] Your Lad'ships most joyful humble Servant, you'r 
welcome to Town; how long have you done it the honour to grace 
it with your presence.
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] But to day, Madam, I'm pleased at the good fortune #
of
meeting you so soon.
   [$ (^Ori.^) $] (^Beliria^) your Servant, O Gud I've been at the   #
Play-house,
where there has been the odiousest Play, so dull, that o' my
Conscience, I shan't abide to set my foot in it again this Twelve
Month. [$ (^Take snuff this time.^) $] 
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I believe there was very little Company there this
Weather; how come you to prefer that Diversion to (^Hide-Park^) ?
   [$ (^Ori.^) $] O Gud, you may very well ask (^Beliria^) , for     #
'twas no choice
of mine, an Alderman's Wife and Daughter did me the
displeasure to Dine with me, and press'd me beyond decency to go with
them; O Jesu, what a vexation 'tis to be with those precise sort
of People, that wou'd not go out of their Road, tho' to be less 
odious.
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] They were famously set out, I warrant you.
   [$ (^Ori.^) $] O most unsuitably, the very sight of their Trappings
wou'd have made you died of heat, of all things I hate Winter
Cloaths in Summer; what say you (^Beliria^) ?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] That there are a sort of People that think Finery  #
never
out of season.
<P 13>
   [$ (^Orin.^) $] Lard, (^Marina^) , I finish't a Copy of Verses    #
last night, which
I have sent to half a score of my Friends for their approbation,
I bestow'd the last upon admirable Sir (^Amorous Courtal^) , but     #
I'le send
you one of them.
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] You'l not fail.
   [$ (^Ori.^) $] Lard, Madam, what do you take me for? (^Beliria^)  #
must
come in too for a Judge.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Pray, what was the Subject?
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] I know none so Entertaining as her self.
   [$ (^Ori.^) $] O, Madam, your most grateful Servant, 'twas upon the
different Addresses I have had made to me of late; O Jesu,
such a glut of Foppery and Mankind; I long to breath a little
of the Country Air, that I may get rid of this Town Lumber,
and entertain my Muse alone with the reflections of what she has
left behind.
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] But, who is that Sir (^Amorous Courtall^) , he's   #
sprung up since
my reign.
   [$ (^Ori.^) $] O Gud, a very pretty Gentleman, (^Marina^) , so    #
Airy, so
well Drest, so Handsom.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] See how Opinions differ, if you'l take mine,       #
(^Marina^) , he's
the most out-cast Fop in Nature, he once made the Campagne,
but all he remembers of it, is running to (^Breda^) , which has given
him fears enough to keep at home all his life after.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] (^Orinda^) , Will you favour me with your Company  #
to night,
we have Musick and Dancing?
   [$ (^Ori.^) $] I'le wait upon you anon, 'tis my Lady Junket's     #
Visiting day,
and she'l never pardon me, if I omit my Devoir.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] O, that old Gossipping thing, she'l never have     #
lost the
relish of youth, but wishes so well too't, she'l bring young loving
things together in spight of their Hearts.
   [$ (^Ori.^) $] Fye (^Beliria^) , Gude I hate you, for being so    #
censorious,
because she allows the freedom of her Apartment to Quality of
both Sexes; A Lady of her age can't be friendly or so, but
presently she is thought procurish.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] O, very friendly, and then so grateful, one Treat  #
shall make
her yours all her life after.
<P 14>
[$ (^Enter Sir^) Amorous Courtall, Wildmore, (^and^) Wildman.$] 

   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Ladies, your humble Servant, 'tis a delicate       #
Evening.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Sir, your Servant, see (^Beliria^) , (^Orinda^) is #
stealing away, go
after, and bring her back.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I have ill Nature enough to break an Appointment,  #
and I
fancy here is one. [$ (^Ex.^) after (^Orinda^) .$] 
   [$ (^Wil.^) to (^Mar.^) $] I have that to say which it concerns   #
you to know,
favour me but with an opportunity after Supper, and let (^Beliria^)
know nothing of it.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] In the Garden I'le expect you.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Ten thousand ages, till then, O (^Marina^) , do    #
not fail me, my
Heart will suffer unspeakably if you shou'd.
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] No more, take my word I'le be there.

[$ (^Enter^) Orinda (^and^) Beliria.$]

   [$ (^Ori.^) $] O Jesu, sure (^Beliria^) you have lost your        #
senses, who wou'd
be seized thus. 
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Together, and so thoughtful, I see the growing     #
evil. [$ (^Aside.^) $] 
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Let me be nothing, Madam, if ever I saw any      #
thing so
killing as your Eyes, they have Charms, my Heart never
understood before.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Yours is a general gallantry to the whole Sex, Sir
(^Amorous^) .
   [$ (^Orin.^) $] Lard, Sir (^Amorous^) , what a loss shou'd we     #
have had, if
you had made the Campagne.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] I must confess I staid in pure Charity to the    #
fair Sex,
to expose them, by my absence, was an inhumanity my Heart cou'd 
not agree to.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] I fancy, Sir (^Amorous^) , you are very fortunate in
Amours.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Let me expire, Madam, if I have any reason to
complain, but those fair Eyes, makes me forget, every thing but
themselves.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I swear Mrs. (^Wildman^) , you talk pleasantly,    #
come (^Marina^) ,
shall we not be going?
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] When you please; (^Orinda^) we must not leave you
behind.
<P 15>
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] You'l give me leave to wait on you to your Coach,
Ladies.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Sir (^Amorous^) , not so fast, come back,         #
[$ (^Ex. Manet.^) [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Monet.^) ^] (^Wild.^) 
Sir (^Am^) $] I've a word with you.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Pax on you, let me go, I must wait upon the      #
Ladies,
'tis such an omission, that I shall never be pardon'd, nor deserve the
Esteem of a Gentleman amongst them.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] You may appologize for that anon, I call'd you    #
back, to
give you a little Advice.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Be sudden then, I cannot live, divided from      #
(^Marina^) . 
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] The old fire, that flames upon sight of every new #
Face,
but I design you for another, who exceeds her in advantages, as
much as you do all the Play-house Beaus in Dress and 
Gallantry.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] No ill Comparison; who is it? I dye to know.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] First then, she's prodigious rich, wears          #
extravagant fine
Cloaths, and has the best way of putting them on.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] O, of all things, I love a Lady well Drest, let  #
me be
nothing, if one that is other, does not look mean, and as if she
were to be loved according.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Then she's Amorous, and will no doubt be presently
taken with you.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] 'Pshaw, Pax, so they all tell me, I cou'd have   #
bated
her that part of the Character, 'tis surfeiting.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Her Fortune however is enviting, if you apply     #

   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Let me expire, if thou dost not talk             #
scandalously, I
hope 'tis not Matrimony thou hint'st at.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Why, you're too much a Man of Mode, to make the
burthen uneasie to you; a Civil Husband, and so forth, is all that a
Wife can rationally expect from you.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Gad, now I think on't, Cold Civility to a Wife,  #
gives
one a good air, let me dye, if I cou'd be fond of an Angel that I
was once Married to, but to be seen abroad with her, were an
extravagance, I shou'd never forgive my self for.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Or if it shou'd happen, once in an Age, I fancy,  #
you
you wou'd make just such meen, as my Lord (^Stately^) , and his Lady,
when they are together in one Coach at (^Hyde-Park^) .
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Just for all the World, or let me expire, let me #
never
breath, if I have not been passionately in love with her uneasie
Frowns, and even ravish't to find during the whole Park time she
<P 16>
had not bestow'd one word, nor look, upon her Lord, one wou'd
have sworn, but by her Frowns, she had not known him to be so
near her.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Gad, I think he matches her, his lolling back in  #
his
Coach, without glance or motion, speaks as much mortification
as her sulleness, the best we can conclude is, that they'r heartily
weary of one another.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Shew me that Married Couple who are not, but then
there's good Management in those Affairs, as in all others; Is it
reasonable to disgust one self with a Wives Company, only to
oblige the Town with Matter for remark, let her take her Coach,
and leave me the freedom of my Chariot, I'le give her the
Ceremony of the Glass as we meet, pass on and make no uneasie
reflections of the heavy load intail'd upon Mortal life.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Besides, my Widow will set all uneasiness aside,  #
and
repair the breach you have made in your Estate.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] The Campaign, the Campaign (^Charles^) , let me be
nothing, if I did not loose Baggage to the value of 1500 (^l.^) all my
Dressing Plate, Wardrobe, and Military Accoutrements, and
was glad to secure my self at (^Breda^) , with only the days
Provision upon my Back, thou art my Friend, to whom I may own
such a Misfortune, let me expire, if ever I was in such a
Consternation since I was born into the World.

with her Maid, Mrs. (^Phoebe^) .

what will People think of you?
   [$ (^Smyrn.^) $] What, Mistress, you'r afraid the Devil should    #
speak
Truth, and discover your Abominations.
   [$ (^Oliv.^) $] The Devil's the Father of Lyars, how shou'd he    #
speak
Truth.
   [$ (^Smy.^) $] You are the Mother of Lyars, and that Cuckold maker
(^Wild-man^) , one of your vile Disciples.
   [$ (^Oliv.^) $] Because you heard he courted me before I was      #
Married,
you think I must needs be naught with him.
<P 18>
   [$ (^Smy.^) $] No, no, very Good in your sense, I warrant; Naught,
why thou art not a Citizen's Wife for nothing; thou hast more
grace I trust in the Lord, than not to think Cuckolding thy
Husband a good honest practicable Thing; those are naught who
do it so awkardly that the World is acquainted with it; nay their
very Husbands, who are always the last in knowing the Favours
that are done them.
   [$ (^Oliv.^) $] But sure, you don't believe, that an ignorant     #
block-head

my case of
Enquiry your Ladiship can exceed all the Cunning men in

you won't make me as wise as your self, but put me here upon
unlawful means, the Sin will lye at your door, Wife, you'd as good
confess, and save charges into the Bargain.

Astrologer comes.
   [$ (^Oliv.^) $] Lord, Husband, what do you take me for? Why, if it
were so, do you think I'd be such a Fool to confess.
   [$ (^Smyr.^) $] No; Thou'rt wiser o' my Conscience, but be sure   #
you are
as trusty to other Folks; you Women have she Friends that you
discover your failings to, and that way the Secret comes about; 'tis
for your Interest, as well as mine, to keep the matter private, if
'twere but for the sake of preserving your Lovers, they are squeamish
amongst such a glut of Womens Flesh, and are disgusted by that

only whether my Wife do me Justice, you understand me Friend;
I'm plaguily afraid of being a Cuckold, an ignorant Cuckold, Sir,
for that's all; Pray consult the Stars, that I may come to the
knowledge of my good Fortune.

Devil in
the Circle.

sorry
ignorant Knave, that has more Will than Power to do Evil.
   [$ (^Smyr.^) $] They say a Woman can out-wit the Devil, and I     #
believe
out-Face him too -- Well, Mr. (^Knowlittle^) , have you done? What
do the Stars say, am I represented with Horns like Capricorn, with
a certain Tall young Gentleman in my Figure, who does my Wife
the Honour to Love her, better then she can her Husband.
   [$ (^Know.^) $] Your Wife, Sir, looks like a good Virtuous Lady,  #
and
your Figure speaks you to be a mighty dissatisfy'd Person, a little
troubled in your Brain with Jealousie; but either my Skill deceives
me, or you have no occasion for it.
   [$ (^Smyr.^) $] How say you Master (^Knowlittle^) , do you like   #
my Wife too?
does the Stars denote me for further Cuckoldom, what
encouragement do they give you, to take her part for she's so bad, not
one Devil in Hell dares do it without a Bribe.

   [$ (^Smyr.^) $] Ay Friend, and I see 'tis more than thou canst    #
do, thou art
going to convince me of the Vanity and Folly of all those who
have helped thee to deceive themselves.
   [$ (^Know.^) $] How, Sir, do you undervalue my Profession?
   [$ (^Smyr.^) $] O no, Sir, Your Profession is a very Learned      #
Profession;
but I much doubt the Skill of the Professor.
   [$ (^Know.^) $] Were it not for this Virtuous, Good Lady, I cou'd #
show
you a Proof of my Art wou'd make you tremble; yet verily it may be
a means to acquit her; how say you, Sir, if you dare stand it,
I'll raise a Familiar to convince you, and protect your Wife near me.
   [$ (^Smyr.^) $] Wou'd you frighten me into an Opinion of your Art,
you that can't tell a Man whether, or no, he's a Cuckold; I have
no Faith in you, and therefore dare stand the Worst.

   [$ (^Wild.^) $] To Morrow, Sir (^Rustick^) is the happy day.
   [$Sir (^Rus.^) $] Be-gad, I long for the Sack-posset, and
throwing the Stocking; that was the Fashion when I was Married, and a 
good Sociable one too; I mean to make use of it still. He, he, he! I
have bin telling her, how eager all the young Fellows will be of     #
hitting
the Bride in the Face; but be-dad, I hope I shall hit her better 
somewhere else; before (^George^) , I'll try to get a Nap in this    #

Dream of to Morrow, before to Morrow comes.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Sir (^Rustick^) is falling asleep over his Wooing. #
When we force 
Nature beyond her self, she must return for a recruit.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Be-gad Madam! You don't know what an Insipid      #
Fellow I
am this way; I never Love taking fruitless pains: If I had not a real
Inclination for you; the Devil take me, I if wou'd pretend it. For
where's the satisfaction of dissembling; when that, which shou'd be a
reward to our endeavours, disgusts our Inclinations.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] You Men of the Town, never value a Woman for her   #
self,
'tis only to increase the Wretched number, tho' your selves are never 
the better for it.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] That's only seen amongst the Loose, Idle part of  #
Mankind;
who not setting a value upon their own Reputations, think it no fault
to Expose a Lady.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Well, not disputing any further your Talent of     #
Secrecy, what
Security can you give of your Sincerity?
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Your Charms, and the opinion the World has of my  #
Sense:
Be-gad, wou'd you have a more undoubted one? If a Woman be very
handsome, and meets with a Man who has Wit enough to know and
value it; the Consequence speaks it self, and needs no Corroborating
Evidence.

easie; but
Pox, why this haste, to bring a young Fellow into slavery? Does he
know the Design?

how she'l

Countenance, to let a young Fellow know, one has a mind to lye with  #
him,
one Night sooner than he design'd.

(^For to Love is Noble frailty, but Poor sin,
When once we fall to Love, unlov'd again.^) [$ (^Exit^) Orinda.$] 
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] O your Ladyship flatters me, or let me dye! But  #
to say
what has bin said before, Blows from hands so soft, who wou'd not    #
bear!
   [$L. (^Y. L.^) $] Sir (^Amorous^) , you are a Judge of Decorum    #
and Decency;
what say you to walking in, and seeing the Bridall Bed?
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] I'll follow your Ladyship through the World; but #
I shall
expire in seeing the place where my Happiness is to be Sacrificed.
   [$L. (^Y. L.^) $] O Jesu! 'Tis a thousand pities so pretty a young
Gentleman shou'd have an uneasie Moment. [$ (^Exeunt.^) $] 

[$SCENE (^Changes to the Garden.^) $]

[$Wilmore, (^and^) Marina.$]

   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Grant, I dispense with that one Form of our Sex,
disbelieving a Lover; when he first tells us he is such; how can you
avoid my Mother, or delay her expectations? (^Belira^) , whose       #
reasons I
could not comprehend before; will do all that's necessary to ruine
our intelligence.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] If nothing else can secure me, your Denial must.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Twelve Thousand Pounds is a Forfeiture too great   #
to oblige
an Enemy with. I hear (^Belira's^) voice, she must not see us        #
together.
[$ (^Exit Marina.^) $] 
[$ (^Enter^) Belira, (^followed by^) Wildman.$] 

   [$ (^Bel.^) $] But why do you follow me?
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] But why do you fly me?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] (^Marina^) shot that way. I see (^VVilmore^) at    #
the bottom of the
Walk, I have business with him; oblige me, and leave us together.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] You Command me. [$ (^Exit^) Wildman.$] 
[$Wilmore (^comes forward^) .$]
   [$ (^VVil.^) $] Here so late (^Belira^) ?
<P 26>
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I come in search of you, the Bride expects you.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] To Night! It must not be.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] The same thing as to Morrow, the sooner 'tis over  #
the better;
for in these cases our fears are the worst part of our punishment. Was
not (^Marina^) with you? she is wanted. Sir (^Rustick^) has drank    #
himself
into a Matrimonial Temper, and Mr. (^Priest-Craft^) Swears twelve at #
Night,
is as Canonical as that of Noon.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] (^Belira^) , have you Loved me!
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Has not my Ruin told you?
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Then do you Love me?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Yes, to see you happy -- But the Mask is off, and  #
thou canst
Cheat no more, and I no more believe.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] You never Loved, but now abhor me.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] You reproach me with what I wou'd be; do not, do   #
not rouze
the Woman in me, I wou'd be Calm to Night and see you Married.
   [$ (^VVil.^) $] Rather see me Buried.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Perhaps so -- Cou'd the remembrance of my Wrongs   #
but sleep
with thee, I wou'd not Envy thee a quiet Grave.
   [$ (^VVil.^) $] Farewel, we part for ever, I'll leave the Town    #
this Minute.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] At least, Sir, if you will not Marry your self,    #
but unkindly leave
your Bride thus in the longing Moment; do your Father the honour to
grace his Marriage.
   [$ (^VVil.^) $] What have I done, that you shou'd wish to make me #
Wretch'd?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] What hast thou left undone to make me such?
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Your Reputation yet stands fair, and unless        #
[^SOURCE TEXT: uless^] your own
Indiscretion betrays you the Secret shall be such, with me for ever.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] But thy heart, Traytor, thy perjur'd Heart; tell   #
me, how shall
I get it back?
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Never this way, I assure you.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] 'Tis given for gone then -- Go -- Live as Wretch'd #
as I can
make you, I'll think no more upon you.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Where, Madam, are you going? [$ (^going.^) $] 
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] To a Wedding, Sir, (^Marina's^) Wedding; you say   #
we must not
Dance at yours.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Rather of the two (^Belira^) , but why to Night?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] All Bridgrooms are not as backward as your self;   #
your Father
has the start of you, in desire as well as years, he is impatient of #
his
Happiness.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] You are Peevish (^Belira^) ; does you Love make    #
you Jealous?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I have none, the (^Moor^) has taught me better; no #
longer
doubting, away at once with Love and Jealousie.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Then 'tis Spite disturbs you: In what have I       #
deserved it?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Look in thy false perfidious Heart, and take my    #
Answer
thence.
<P 27>
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] That speaks of nothing you can quarrel with.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Then I will stay and argue with thee, how often    #
hast thou told,
thou coud'st for ever Love me?
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] I told you that I cou'd, not that I wou'd.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Poor Caviller, those who can jest with Oaths, can  #
play with
Words -- You'l come after and wish the Bride Joy.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] We must not part thus, you were not used to fly my #
Arms.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] By all that's good, he has got the sorry cunning   #
of our Sex;
just so does a Wife when her Husband has caught her false, the gilting
Creature cries, Do you believe it Spouse? you do not use to be so
unkind -- Ha, ha, ha, -- Let me Laugh, tho' 'tis maliciously; go on,
I'm in the Vein of Audience; let me hear some disagreeable Truths,
and how well thou canst turn Woman; (^Marina^) is at stake before you,
do it handsomely; I wou'd be fortified in my Aversion, and have my
hate implacable.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] 'Tis Barbarous to insult, where you shou'd rather  #
pity.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I do, let all the World be judge else; nay, do     #
more than Pity, I
wou'd prevent your Ruin, and stop the Passage up to your undoing,
wou'd save you from the Ills, nay, Scorns of Poverty, keep your      #
Friends
such, and put it in your Power to be one by still Preserving you: The
Worlds opinion, who judge of Merit but by Fortunes Favours.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] We know the Extent of your Generosity: But serve   #
me as I
wou'd be serv'd, (^Belira^) .
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I thought this was your way: I mistook you for him #
that was to
Marry my Lady (^Young Love^) -- But I'll go look for certainties
within.
[$ (^Going.^) $] 
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Come back (^Belira^) , 'tis my last Call: I wou'd  #
satisfie thy
Womanish Revenge, and let thee see me Curst by any other way than
Fatal Marriage -- Take my Sword -- Thy Malice can supply thy
want of use, despight can furnish strength, and too often thou hast
found the way to my unhappy Heart to miss it now.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Ha, ha, ha, in Love to dying! By all that's good,  #
turn'd
(^Hero^) : Your Mistress, Sir, is much obliged -- Keep your Sword,
it may be a Fortune better worth than all your Fathers Lands; there's
Wars abroad, you may employ it in, 'twill keep your Wife from
wanting here at Home.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Am I indeed your Scorn, Proud, Fantastick Woman; thy
liking was foul Lust; not Love: That gentle Name brings
Happiness, but thou -- Let me not think upon thee, for fear it force
my Tongue to something worse, than shou'd be said of Ladies;
I've served it seems, as long as you cou'd like, and now you chuse
another.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Wou'd it were come to that, I wou'd exchange thee, #
for
<P 28>
the last of Men, and think the Bargain Cheap, wou'd part with
all that goodly Form, for honest Ugliness, and think it fairer; thy
Youth for Age, and Doat upon his Doatage -- So in return I found
but Truth, mark well that word, that word has Charms thou never
knewest, and which out-weighs thine.
   [$ (^VVil.^) $] (^Belira^) , thou hast power to read my Soul; thy #
Magick
Spells are irresistable. How hast thou found this Failing in my
Vertue, which I not knowing of, my Wants cou'd never miss till
now?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Thank my Wit, Natures best Gift -- I've seen your
shuffling poor designing Arts, to wave this Marriage and promote
another. Your care too, of (^Marina's^) Fortune falsly guilded with
the weak pretence of Generosity; 'twas not doubled thick enough
for me: But because Doubts never shou'd condemn the Man I
Loved, I wou'd not seem to doubt till I was certain; therefore
no more dissembling, 'tis vain, (^Marina^) never shall be yours; and
if you cou'd not think it an unhappiness, I fain wou'd keep you 
mine.
   [$ (^VVil.^) $] Give me this Night to think in, I'll promise      #
nothing, but this:
I'm Grateful where I am obliged.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] To shew your Power, I will; my Lady (^Young Love^) #
through my
persuasion designed this the Marriage Night; I'll excuse you to her,
but not one word or thought of (^Marina^) , for in that Moment she   #
shall
be bestowed upon another; I wou'd divide the World, rather than
you shou'd meet; I hope to Morrow, we may give you joy; this Night
I find but little.
[$ (^Exit^) Belira.$]
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Less thou hast left behind, O the Curse of         #
Lewdness! What
Woman's Fair after we find her Faulty? What Lady Innocent, when no
longer Chaste? Or who so vain to hope for Honour, or for Pity from
that Soul who wants it for her self?

[$ (^Enter^) Wildman.$] 

   [$ (^Wild.^) $] What I hear 'tis deferrd, there's no hopes of     #
Posset.
(^Belira^) has dissmiss'd me till to Morrow, she's gone to your      #
Bride; by
this time Sir (^Amorous^) has supplanted you, he is shut up with     #
her, and
has impudence enough to bid fair for it.
   [$ (^VVil.^) $] They talk of Eating against ones Stomach, but no
Surfeit is so nauseous, as what I'm in danger of, (^Belira^) catch'd #
me in the
Action; and Faith, a sinner must have more impudence than I, who
can deny matter of Fact.
<P 29>
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Be gad, I have Pimpt to a fair end: What to let   #
a Woman
out-wit thee? How cou'd you once think of being sincere to one, whose
Interest runs counter to yours? I would have dissembled as much Love
as I had Aversion; nay Counterfeited my first desires, and suffered  #
her,
to believe she had preserved the Conquest of me now, that I might have
Triumphed over her all my life after.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Very well, I am railed at on all sides.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] Thou hast this Moment in thy Face, all the        #
Mortification
of poor Lenten Penitents, and lookst more akin to the Spirit than the
Flesh. I believe thou art not in the condition of Wedlock. Confess
your Misfortune to my Lady (^Young-Love^) , I know no reason, why a
Man shou'd pretend false Courage, when by it he runs himself into an
inconveniency, he might have otherways avoided.

[$ (^Enter Sir^) Amorous.$] 

   [$ (^Am.^) $] Faith, if lying, dissembling and flattering, can    #
deserve her, I
have done it. After we parted, I underwent the Mortification of an
Arrest, which has the better fitted me for that of Matrimony; 'twas
necessary for me, to have just got out of the Baliffs hands, to be   #
able to
go through with her, or else let me expire, if I cou'd have done it.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] But what's the Consequence, Sir (^Amorous^) ?
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] No more, than deferring the Marriage. The Duce   #
take me if
I don't think it Exceeds all (^Hercules's^) Labours, to be able to   #
perswade
a Widow to lye alone, when she is resolved to have a Bed-fellow.

[$ (^Enter^) Ready.$] 

   [$ (^Wild.^) $] The next Affair shall be resolv'd in your         #
Chamber, where
I'll wait Sir (^Amorous^) and you in a Minute.
   [$ (^Wil.^) $] Nay if you wou'd be private, I'm discreet.
   [$Sir (^Am.^) $] Let me be nothing, if he has not some melting    #
Billet, I
know it by his very Air. Good Fortune to thee (^Charles^) .
[$ (^Exeunt Sir^) Amorous, Wil.$] 
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] [$ (^Reads,^) $] Hum! to Morrow Morning like a    #
Phisician. (^Ready^) , where
had you this Letter?
   [$ (^Ready.^) $] Mrs. (^Phoebe^) brought it to your Lodgings. She #
says her Master
has bin at the Fortune-tellers, to Enquire, whether your Honour had
made him a Cuckold.
   [$ (^Wild.^) $] I am sorry, the Devil cou'd not answer him in the
Affirmative: She writes me word that (^Smyrna's^) sick with his      #
fright, and that
I may pass upon him for a Physician; however, I believe my skill lyes
most (^Olivias^) way. (^Ready^) , go and knock up my Apothecary;     #
borrow
his Velvet Coat with the great Gold Buttons. A few hard words, of
Plebotomy, Purgative, Laxative, and I shall be set up in my          #
Profession,
<P 30>
and look like any Collegiate Doctor of them all -- Why then, the
Devil take me if I don't go -- Now the matter's brought to
Perfection, I'll not fall asleep over the Brazen Head, when it       #
shou'd answer
me. Yes.
(^I'll watch the falling of the Golden Shower,
And reap my Harvest in the shining Hour.^) [$ (^Exeunt omnes.^) $]
