<P 11C2>
   [$ (^Cryer.^) $] The evidence you shall give,
between our Sovereign Lord the King 
and the prisoner at the bar, shall be the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but 
the truth; so help you God. Kiss the 
book. [$ (^ (Which he did.) ^) $]

   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Mr Thomas, pray 
tell my Lord, and the Jury, what your 
business is.
   [$ (^Henry Thomas.^) $] I am clerk to Mr Jones, 
a Stationer, in the Temple.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Look upon this 
deed [$ (^ (giving him the counterpart executed
by the prisoner.) ^) $] Do you know the 
hand-writing of that engrossment; if so, tell 
us whose it is.
   [$ (^Henry Thomas.^) $] This is my hand-writing 
as far as to the words (^ (In witness 
whereof,) ^) and so on.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] How came you not 
to engross the whole?
   [$ (^Henry Thomas.^) $] I cannot positively say. --
We sometimes leave out the conclusion 
by gentlemen's desire, in order that they 
may add a covenant, or some such thing, 
if it should be thought necessary; but 
I cannot particularly recollect the reason 
why the conclusion was omitted in this 
case.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] How many parts 
of this deed did you engross?
   [$ (^Henry Thomas.^) $] I engrossed this; and, 
as appears by our day-book, another part.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] From whom did 
you receive the instructions for these 
engrossments?
   [$ (^Henry Thomas.^) $] From Mr Jones's son.
<P 12C1>
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Were the parts you 
engrossed agreeable to the draft?
   [$ (^Henry Thomas.^) $] They were.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Look at the words 
(^ (thirty-five pounds) ^) engrossed at length in 
the reddendum and covenant, for payment 
of the rent in this counterpart; were they 
part of the original ingrossment, or were 
they afterwards inserted in blanks left for 
that purpose?
   [$ (^Henry Thomas.^) $] I engrossed them at the 
same time that I engrossed the rest, 
agreeable to the draft.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] Prisoner, would 
you ask this witness any question?
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] We will now prove 
the execution of this counterpart by the 
prisoner. -- Call Mr Fannen. [$ (^ (Who appeared, and
was sworn.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Alexander Wedderburne, Esq; of counsel for 
the Crown.^) $] Mr Fannen, look upon this 
deed; [$ (^ (giving him the counterpart) ^) $] did
you see it executed, and by whom?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] This deed was executed 
by Mr Ayliffe in my presence.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Tell us, if you can 
recollect, when this was, and where?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] I am not sure; but to 
the best of my remembrance, it was 
sometime the beginning of December last, at 
Mr Fox's house.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Was there any other 
deed executed at the same time?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] There was another part 
executed by Mr Fox.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Look upon the back 
of this deed; are you one of the 
subscribing witnesses? 
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] I am; and so I was to 
the other part, which was executed by Mr 
Fox.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Had you any 
conversation with the prisoner touching this 
<P 12C2>
lease immediately after the execution of 
it?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] I had; but I cannot say, 
whether it was immediately, or a day or 
two after the lease was executed.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Where was this?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] It was in my room at 
Mr Fox's house; I was not sure, though 
I guessed, that the deed executed by Mr 
Fox and witnessed by me, was a lease 
of Rusley park; and, therefore, I asked 
Mr Ayliffe, whether Rusley park was 
let; to which he answered,that Mr Fox 
had been so good to let it him at the 
rent of thirty or thirty five pounds a year --
I am not positive which. -- And he 
expressed great obligations to Mr Fox for his 
goodness in so doing.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I should be glad to look at 
that deed.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] You shall see it as 
soon as it has been read. In the mean 
time, would you ask this witness any 
question?
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] My Lord, we will now call 
a witness to prove the concluding words 
of this counterpart (^ (In witness whereof 
the parties to these presents have hereunto 
interchangeably set their hands and seals, 
the day and year first above written) ^) to be 
of the prisoner's own hand-writing -- Call 
Mr Ellis Dawe. [$ (^ (Who appeared and was 
sworn.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Mr Dawe, look at 
the concluding words in this deed, 
beginning with the words (^ (In witness whereof) ^)
and tell us if you know the hand-writing.
   [$ (^Ellis Dawe.^) $] I do: I am well acquainted 
with the prisoner Mr Ayliffe; and believe 
these words to be of his hand-writing.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Look upon the 
endorsement; I mean the title of the deed 
<P 13C1> 
written upon the back of it; Whose 
hand-writing do you take that to be?
   [$ (^Ellis Dawe.^) $] I believe it to be Mr 
Ayliffe's hand.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Are you well 
acquainted with his hand-writing?
   [$ (^Ellis Dawe.^) $] I am.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Have you seen him 
write?
   [$ (^Ellis Dawe.^) $] I have often seen him 
write.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] We have now fully 
established this deed, and desire it may be 
read.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] Let it be read.
[^SUMMARY OF THE DEED'S CONTENT OMITTED. THE DEED IS THEN SHOWN  
TO BOTH JURY AND PRISONER.^]
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] My Lord, we will now 
proceed to prove the publication of the 
lease mortgaged by the prisoner to William 
Clewer, Esq; and which bears date the 
22d of Nov. and is at the yearly rent of 
5 l. and for that purpose we will first 
prove the mortgage, wherein that lease is 
recited. -- Call Walter Hargrave. [$ (^ (Who 
appeared and was sworn.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Mr Hargrave, look at your 
name set upon the back of this mortgage, 
as a witness to the execution of it; and 
tell us, whether that is your 
hand-writing?
<P 13C2>
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] This is my hand.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] By whom did you see this 
mortgage executed?
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] By Mr Ayliffe. -- 
I saw him sign, seal, and deliver it, as 
his act and deed. 
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Where did you see it 
executed?
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] At Mr Priddle's 
chambers, in the King's-Bench-Walks, 
in the Inner-Temple.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Is your name, set as a 
subscribing witness to the receipt for the 
consideration-money, likewise of your hand 
writing?
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] It is: I saw Mr 
Ayliffe sign this receipt for 1700 l.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Did you see the prisoner, 
at the time of the execution of this 
mortgage, deliver any title-deeds to Mr 
Clewer?
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] Yes, he delivered 
several deeds to Mr Clewer, and that lease 
[$ (^ (pointing to the lease set out in the 
indictment) ^) $] was one of them.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Do you remember any 
request being made at this time, to keep 
the mortgage of that lease a secret? and 
if you do, tell us by whom such request 
was made, and who were present.
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] Mr Ayliffe desired 
Mr Bradley, Mr Green, Mr Clewer, and 
myself, to swear that we would keep it 
secret.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] What answer was assigned to 
this?
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] We told him we 
would take no such oath.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Was any reason given for 
such request?
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] The reason Mr 
Ayliffe gave, was, that he would not on 
any account have it come to Mr Fox's 
ears.
<P 14C1>

[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $]

   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Pray Sir, have 
you any particular reason for 
remembering this lease, so as to be sure, that it 
was one of the title-deeds delivered by the 
prisoner to Clewer?
   [$ (^Walter Hargrave.^) $] Yes, I have. -- I'll 
show you.-- I remember it by this stamp.
[$ (^ (Pointing to an imperfect blotted 
country-stationer's mark in the margin.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Cryer.^) $] Mr Jones is come. -- [$ (^ (Who 
appeared, and was sworn.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] My Lord, with 
your lordship's leave, we will now go 
back to the leases engrossed at Mr Jones's, 
to which he ought regularly to have been 
examined before, but that he happened 
not to be in court. -- Mr Jones, do you 
remember any person's applying to you, 
some time in the latter end of the year 
1758, to have a lease of Rusley-park, in 
Wiltshire, engrossed in the name of 
Ayliffe?
   [$ (^Mr Jones.^) $] Yes; I did three parts of such 
lease, Fox and Ayliffe. -- My clerk Henry 
Thomas engrossed two of them, and 
Henzell the other.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Were there any 
particular directions given you by the person 
who brought the draft to your house, 
about omitting the common conclusion?   
   [$ (^Mr Jones.^) $] I can't positively say, 'till 
I see the deeds themselves. [$ (^ (The 
counterpart of the lease executed by the prisoner 
being thereupon put into his hand) ^) $] We 
engross'd this deed down to the words, (^In 
witness^) . -- But the conclusion beginning 
with those words is of some other person's 
hand. -- It was omitted to leave room for 
<P 14C2>
something to be added, and must have 
been ordered so by the person who brought 
the draft.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] Mr Fannen; the 
last witness, has said there were three parts 
of the lease engrossed at his house, how 
many parts did you see executed? 
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] There were only two 
parts executed; the original lease and 
counterpart; the first by Mr Fox and the 
other by Mr Ayliffe.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] My Lord, we desire that 
the mortgage to Clewer, which we have 
proved to have been executed by the 
prisoner, may be read, in order to shew that 
the lease which Hargrave swore was 
delivered to Clewer, is the very lease recited in, 
and assigned by, that mortgage.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] Let it be read.
[^SUMMARY OF THE MORTGAGE'S CONTENT OMITTED.^]
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] We will now, my Lord, 
proceed to prove, that the lease thus 
recited in, and assigned by, this mortgage to
Clewer, and proved to have been delivered 
to him by the prisoner, is forged. --
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Mr Fannen, be 
pleased to look at this lease. -- [$ (^ (The lease set out 
in the indictment.) ^) $]  Is the name John 
<P 15C1> 
Fannen, written upon the back as a 
subscribing witness, of your hand-writing?   
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] No Sir, it is not my 
writing?
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Look at the name H. 
Fox, subscribed at the bottom of it; is 
that Mr Fox's hand?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] It is not.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Are you well 
acquainted with Mr Fox's hand-writing?
   [$ (^Mr Fannen.^) $] I am.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] How long have you 
been acquainted with it?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] I have known Mr Fox's 
hand-writing these thirteen years.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] Is your name upon 
that deed like your hand-writing?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] There is an imitation 
of my hand, but it is a very bad one.

[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $]
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Do you always 
write your name in the same manner?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] I suppose I may not 
always write it exactly the same, but as 
nearly so as possible.    
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Then, how 
can you be positive, that this is not your 
hand?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] Because it is a very bad 
imitation of it.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] What reason 
have you for calling it a bad imitation?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] Because it is not like it. 
It was certainly intended to imitate my 
hand; but compare that writing with 
mine upon the counterpart, and you'll see 
a very great difference.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Look at these 
[$ (^ (producing three several letters) ^) $] are these 
of your hand-writing?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] They are my writing.

[$ (^They were delivered into court.^) $]
<P 15C2>
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Can you positively 
swear, that your name on the back of that 
lease is not of your hand-writing?
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] I do.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice, to Fannen.^) $] The 
counterpart, which has been read, is dated 
the 27th of November: and you have 
said, that, at the time of the execution 
of it, there was but one part executed by 
Mr Fox; I would, therefore, ask you, 
whether, in that month, or within a short 
time before or after, you was witness 
to any other deed between Mr Fox and 
the prisoner? 
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] No, my Lord, I was 
not: I remember being a witness to this 
counterpart executed by the prisoner, and 
to the original executed by Mr Fox, but 
to no other deeds within that year.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Call Mr Hobson. 
[$ (^Who appeard, and was sworn.^) $] Take that 
lease into your hand [$ (^ (the lease set out 
in the indictment) ^) ;$] is the name, James 
Hobson, which is written upon the back of 
it, of your hand-writing?    
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] No, Sir, it is not.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Does it appear to 
you to have been writ with an intention 
to imitate your hand? 
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] It certainly was 
intended to be an imitation of my hand?
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Does it resemble 
your hand-writing?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I think very little. There 
are two letters particularly that are very 
bad; the (^H^) is much wider than I write 
it, and the tops of the (^n^) are not at all like 
mine.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Look at the 
counterpart, are you a subscribing witness to it?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I am: I remember my 
being a witness to the prisoner's executing 
this counterpart, and to Mr Fox's 
executing the original.
<P 16C1>
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Was you ever a 
subscribing witness to the execution of any 
other deed between Mr Fox and the 
prisoner?    
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I don't recollect that 
I ever was.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Are you sure that 
you was not a witness to any such deed in 
the month of November last?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I am certain I was 
not.
   [$ (^ Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Or in December?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I do not remember that 
I was.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] When was this deed 
executed?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] To the best of my memory 
it was upon the 11th of December. 
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] Can you recollect 
whether you witnessed any such deed 
within a month or two before, or after, the 
month of December, 1758? 
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I don't remember that 
I was a witness to any other deed at all.

[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $]

   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] You say you 
was not a witness to any other deed 
executed by Mr Fox to the prisoner. -- Pray, look 
at this instrument; did you not see Mr 
Fox execute it, and are not you a 
subscribing witness? [$ (^Giving him a paper 
writing, signed and sealed by Mr Fox.) ^) $]
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] That is my hand-writing, 
and I saw Mr Fox set his name to this 
paper.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] You may not, 
perhaps, understand what is meant by a (^deed^) ; 
and, therefore, I will ask you, whether 
you remember your being a witness in the 
months of November or December last, 
or at any time before or after, to the 
execution of any other (^parchment-deed^) by 
<P 16C2>
Mr Fox, besides the lease and counterpart, 
which you have mentioned?   
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I do not remember that 
I was.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Are you acquainted 
with Mr Fox's hand-writing?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I am well acquainted 
with it.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Do you live with 
him?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I do.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] How long have you 
known his hand-writing?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] About eight years.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Look upon the name 
H. Fox subscribed to the deed [$ (^ (the lease 
set out in the indictment) ^) ,$] is that Mr Fox's 
hand-writing?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I believe not.
   
[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $]

   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Tell us why you 
think so.
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] Because of the I in the H. 
[$ (^ (pointing to the first limb of the H.) ^) $] which 
Mr Fox always makes with a pointed 
top; whereas, the top of this is round; 
and because of the (^x^) , the end of which 
is turned in a different manner from what 
Mr Fox usually does.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Look at these 
(^x's^) ; [$ (^ (producing some papers signed H. Fox.) ^) $] 
and tell us wherein they differ from this.
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] The turn of the (^x^) on 
the parchment is rounder than in those of 
Mr Fox's writing.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Do you think 
it possible for a gentleman, in the course 
of his signing his name, to write always 
just alike?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I think it is possible for 
a man to write always very much alike?
<P 17C1>
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Have you 
observed any difference in the manner of Mr 
Fox's signing his name to a frank, and 
when he subscribes it to a deed or letter?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] He does make a 
difference.    
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Describe that 
difference.
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] Mr Fox uses a different 
(^X^) in his franks, from what he does at 
other times; he turns the first limb of it 
towards the right, and draws a strait 
stroke a-cross.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Pray look at 
his name on this paper, is this his 
writing?
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] It is.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Is not the top 
of that (^I^) [$ (^ (pointing to the first limb of the 
H, upon the last paper) ^) $] larger than the 
top of this?  [$ (^ (Pointing to the first limb of 
the H on one of the former papers.) ^) $]
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] It is larger; but they are 
both pointed.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Is not that (^x^) 
[$ (^ (upon the last paper) ^) $] like the (^x^) subscribed 
to the deed? [$ (^ (The lease in the indictment.) ^) $] 
Compare them carefully.
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] If you look at them 
together, you will see a very great 
difference.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Look at the 
name H. Fox upon this paper. [$ (^ (Producing 
a frank.) ^) $] Is not that H very like the H 
at the foot of that deed? [$ (^ (The lease in the 
indictment.) ^) $]
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] There is but very little 
difference except in the (^x's^) .
   [$ (^John Fannen.^) $] This frank may probably 
be one of the prisoner's making; for he 
used sometimes to frank in Mr Fox's 
name.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Do you know what 
business Mr Ayliffe was of formerly?
<P 17C2>
   [$ (^James Hobson.^) $] I know nothing more of 
him than that he was Mr Fox's steward.

[$ (^The papers were all delivered into court.^) $]

   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] My Lord, we will now 
corroborate the evidence of the two last 
witnesses, by the testimony of other 
gentlemen well acquainted with their 
hand-writing, and with Mr Fox's. -- Call 
Mr Netherton. [$ (^ (Who appeared, and was 
sworn.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Q.^) $] Do you know Mr Fannen?    
   [$ (^Samuel Netherton.^) $] I do; and have been 
intimate with him several years?
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Have you seen him write?
   [$ (^Samuel Netherton.^) $] Yes: I have seen him 
write many times.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Look at his name, set as a 
subscribing witness to the execution of this 
deed. [$ (^ (The lease set out in the indictment.) ^) $] 
Is that his hand-writing?
   [$ (^Samuel Netherton.^) $] This is not his hand. -- 
The manner in which this is wrote, 
particularly as to the shape of the letters, is 
not at all like it. -- Mr Fannen makes the 
strokes of his n's farther asunder, freer and
rather sharper, and turns the bottom of 
his J much rounder. 

[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $] 
   
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Look at the 
name John Fannen on these papers; 
[$ (^ (producing two letters) ^) $] do you believe these 
to be his hand?
   [$ (^Samuel Netherton.^) $] I believe they are?
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Are the tops 
of these (^n's^) [$ (^ (upon the paper) ^) $] sharper than 
those upon the parchment? [$ (^ (The lease set out 
in the indictment.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Samuel Netherton.^) $] They appear so. --
There is more similitude between the 
<P 18C1> 
names on those papers, than between 
either of them, and the name on this 
parchment.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] Do you, or do you 
not, believe the name John Fannen, on 
that parchment, to be his hand-writing, 
or are you doubtful?
   [$ (^Samuel Netherton.^) $] I am not in the least 
doubtful, my Lord; it is certainly forged.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Call Mr Cox. [$ (^ (Who 
appeared, and was sworn.) ^) $] Do you know 
Mr Hobson, who has just now been 
examined? 
   [$ (^Samuel Cox.^) $] I do.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Are you acquainted 
with the manner of his hand-writing?   
   [$ (^Samuel Cox.^) $] I am.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Then look at the 
name James Hobson on the back of this 
deed. [$ (^ (The lease set out in the indictment.) ^) $] 
Do you believe that to be his hand? 
   [$ (^Samuel Cox.^) $] That is not his hand-writing.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Are you clear in that 
opinion?
   [$ (^Samuel Cox.^) $] I am.

[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $]

   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Pray, tell us 
the grounds of your objection?
   [$ (^Samuel Cox.^) $] I object against the (^H^) , the 
(^b^) and the (^n^) . Mr Hobson makes his (^H^) 
very narrow; this is very wide; the (^b^) and 
(^n^) are remarkably different.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] How came you 
to be so well acquainted with his hand?
   [$ (^Samuel Cox.^) $] I have received many letters 
from him.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] But did you 
ever see him write his name?
   [$ (^Samuel Cox.^) $] I have often.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice, to Cox.^) $] Do you 
believe Hobson's name upon the back of 
<P 18C2>
that deed to be his hand-writing, or not, 
or are you doubtful?
   [$ (^Samuel Cox.^) $] My Lord, I have no doubt 
at all; I do believe, that this is not his 
hand.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] We desire Mr 
Calcraft may be sworn. [$ (^ (Which was done 
accordingly.) ^) $] Mr Calcraft, I need hardly 
ask you, if you are acquainted with Mr 
Fox's hand-writing?
   [$ (^John Calcraft,^) Esq;$] I am very well 
acquainted with his hand; having often 
seen him write.
   [$ (^Mr Wedderburne.^) $] Then, Sir, please to 
look at the name H. Fox subscribed to 
this deed. [$ (^ (The lease set out in the 
indictment.) ^) $] Is that Mr Fox's hand?
   [$ (^John Calcraft,^) Esq;$] I don't take it to 
be his hand. I never saw him make an 
(^H^) as this. 
   [$ (^L. Ch. Justice, to Mr Calcraft.^) $] Some 
persons, from being more conversant in 
writing, have a more discerning eye than 
others; therefore, Sir, I would ask you, 
whether, from your particular 
acquaintance with Mr Fox's manner of writing, 
or from your knowledge of writing in 
general, you can take upon you to say, that 
you do or do not believe this name to 
be of Mr Fox's writing, or have you any 
doubt about it?
   [$ (^John Calcraft,^) Esq;$] From the 
knowledge I have of Mr Fox's hand, I really 
believe that this is not of his writing; 
I never saw Mr Fox make such an (^H^) as 
this.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Swear Mr Donisthorpe. 
[$ (^ (Which was done.) ^) $] Pray, Sir, are you 
acquainted with Mr Fox's hand-writing?
   [$ (^George Donisthorpe,^) Esq;$] I have been 
acquainted with his hand-writing above 
twenty-eight years.
<P 19C1> 
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Then look upon the name 
H. Fox subscribed to this deed. [$ (^ (The lease 
set out in the indictment.) ^) $] Do you take 
that to be Mr Fox's hand?
   [$ (^George Donisthorpe,^) Esq;$] I do not take 
it to be his hand. 
   [$ (^L. Ch. Justice.^) $] Do you believe, that 
it is not Mr Fox's hand? or are you 
doubtful whether it is or not?
   [$ (^George Donisthorpe,^) Esq;$] I am as 
certain as I can be of any thing which I did 
not see done myself, that this is not Mr 
Fox's hand-writing.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Are you in any station 
under Mr Fox?
   [$ (^George Donisthorpe,^) Esq;$] I have now 
the honour to be his steward.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Do you know Mr Ayliffe, 
the prisoner at the bar?
   [$ (^George Donisthorpe,^) Esq;$] I have known 
him many years.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Are you acquainted with 
his hand-writing, particularly his 
engrossing hand?
   [$ (^George Donisthorpe,^) Esq;$] I am well 
acquainted with his hand-writing; but 
I never saw him engross.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Can you take upon you to 
say, whether you believe the engrossment 
of this deed [$ (^ (the lease set out in the 
indictment) ^) $] to be the prisoner's hand?
   [$ (^George Donisthorpe,^) Esq;$] I don't call 
this an engrossing hand.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Then can you tell us of
whose hand-writing you take this deed 
to be?
   [$ (^George Donisthorpe,^) Esq;$] I am certain 
this is Mr Ayliffe's hand, as certain as 
I am that the name H. Fox at the bottom 
is not of Mr Fox's writing.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] We must desire Mr Dawe 
to stand up again. [$ (^ (Which he did.) ^) $] Mr 
Dawe, you are acquainted with the 
prisoner's hand; pray, look upon this deed, 
<P 19C2>
[$ (^ (the lease set out in the indictment) ^) ;$] whose 
hand do you take it to be?
   [$ (^Ellis Dawe.^) $] I believe it to be Mr 
Ayliffe's hand.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Swear Mr Dalby. 
[$ (^ (Which was done.) ^) $] Did you, Sir, ever see 
Mr Ayliffe write?
   [$ (^James Dalby,^) Esq;$] Yes: I have a great 
many times.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Look upon the body 
of this deed. [$ (^ (The lease set out in the 
indictment.) ^) $] Do you believe it to be of the 
prisoner's hand-writing?
   [$ (^James Dalby,^) Esq;$] This is a much 
stronger hand than he usually writes; but the cut  
and turn of the letters are so exactly the 
same, that I believe it to be his, though 
I cannot say I ever saw any of his writing 
upon parchment before.

[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $]

   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] If you never 
saw any of his writing upon parchment, 
and you admit this to be a stronger hand 
than his, what reason have you to say this 
deed is of his writing?
   [$ (^James Dalby,^) Esq;$] I have often seen 
Mr Ayliffe write, and I have received many 
letters from him; and I say, that the turn 
of the letters in this deed greatly 
resembles the manner of his hand-writing.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Let Mr Jones stand up. 
[$ (^ (Which he did.) ^) $] Pray, look at the 
engrossment of that deed. [$ (^ (The lease set out in the 
indictment.) ^) $] Do you know any thing of 
that hand-writing?
   [$ (^Mr Jones.^) $] This is not the hand-writing 
of any of my people. -- It is not an 
engrossing hand, but very badly wrote.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Are you positive that this 
is not the hand-writing of any of the 
persons whom you employ?
<P 20C1>
   [$ (^Mr Jones.^) $] Yes; I am certain that this 
was not wrote by any of the people whom 
I employ, or ever did. 
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Have you ever seen any 
writing like it?
   [$ (^Mr Jones.^) $] It seems to me to be the 
same hand with the concluding part of 
the counterpart engrossed at my house.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] Give him the counterpart, 
to compare the concluding words of the 
two deeds. [$ (^ (Which was done.) ^) $] Now from 
your skill and practice in writing, do you 
take these two conclusions, beginning at 
the words, (^ (In witness) ^) to be wrote by 
the same hand, or by different hands?
   [$ (^Mr Jones.^) $] They are exactly alike, and
appear to me to have been both done by 
the same hand; and I believe them to 
have been wrote by one person.
 
[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $]

   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Both what!
   [$ (^Mr Jones.^) $] The whole of this deed, 
[$ (^ (the lease set out in the indictment) ^) $] and the 
words (^ (In witness) ^) to the end in the
other. [$ (^ (Pointing to the counterpart.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Swear Samuel Lodge. 
[$ (^ (Which was done.) ^) $] Mr Lodge, do you 
know Mr Ayliffe's hand?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] Yes; Sir, I have been 
acquainted with him many years.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Have you seen him 
write?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] I have seen him write 
several times.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Did you live with 
him?
   [$ (^Samuel.^) $] I used to be frequently 
backwards and forwards with him.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Then look at the 
body of that lease, [$ (^ (the lease set out in the 
indictment) ^) $] and tell us of whose 
hand-writing it is?
<P 20C2>
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] I believe it to be Mr 
Ayliffe's, it greatly resembles his hand. 
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Had you not some 
conversation with the prisoner some time 
about the month of December last, 
concerning a lease from Mr Fox to him of 
Rusley-park?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] I remember I copied the 
draft of such a lease, in order to be carried 
to Mr Paterson, for his perusal.                                                     
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] What was the rent 
reserved?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] I left a blank for the 
rent, Mr Ayliffe having told me, that 
he did not know what the rent was to be; 
he said it was to be a small one; perhaps, 
5 l. a year; and possibly, but a 
peppercorn.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] What was done 
with this draft?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] When I had wrote it, 
I believe I carried it to Mr Paterson. 
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Do you know of the 
engrossing of that draft?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] No, Sir, I don't.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Did the prisoner, at 
any time after the lease was executed, tell 
you what the rent was?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] He told me it was five 
pounds a year.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Did you see the 
lease itself after it was executed?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] I did.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] When did you see 
it, and upon what occasion?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] I can't directly say the 
time; but I believe it was in December 
last; Mr Ayliffe delivered it to me, among 
other writings, at Mr Priddle's chambers, 
or coming from thence.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Did he at that time 
tell you what the rent was? 
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] No; not at that time; 
but I looked to see. I had to put the parcel 
<P 21C1>  
into my pocket; and going soon after,
to the vault; and having no waste-paper, 
I took out the writings, which were 
wrapped up in a new's-paper, and tore 
part of it off. This gave me the 
opportunity of seeing that the lease of Rusley 
was in the parcel; upon which, I had the 
curiosity to look into it, and see what
the rent reserved was; and then I saw that 
it was 35 l.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Was that lease of 
the prisoner's hand-writing?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] No: it was a very 
different hand, more like the hand-writing 
of the counterpart which has been produced 
here, as far as a person can carry the 
resemblance of hand-writings in his mind.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Did you look at 
the name subscribed at the bottom?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] Yes: it was signed 
H. Fox.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] You said you had 
known the prisoner a long time; what 
was he originally?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] I believe he kept a 
school.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] What school?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] A writing and reading 
school, I believe.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] Where was it he 
kept a school?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] At Lineham, in the 
county of Wilts.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] You say you are 
acquainted with the manner of the 
prisoner's hand-writing; pray, look at the 
signature, H. Fox, at the foot of this deed, 
[$ (^ (the lease set out in the indictment) ^) ;$] whose 
hand-writing do you believe that to be?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] It appears to me to have 
a strong resemblance of Mr Ayliffe's 
hand-writing.
   [$ (^Mr Serjeant Davy.^) $] What reason have
<P 21C2> 
you to think so; have you ever seen him 
sign Mr Fox's name?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] I have two or three 
times seen him frank letters in Mr Fox's 
name; and this looks like Mr Ayliffe's 
manner of writing Mr Fox's name, though 
it is wrote larger than what he used to do 
in the franks.

[$ (^Cross Examination.^) $]

   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Did the prisoner 
use to write Mr Fox's name in the manner 
it is signed to that lease?
   [$ (^Samuel Lodge.^) $] Yes; except the (^x^) , 
which he wrote like that used by Mr Fox 
in his franks.
[^MR. ASTON'S SPEECH OMITTED: HE DECLARES THE FORGERY PROVED.^]
<P 22C1>
[$ (^The forged lease was then read, and by the 
counsel for the prisoner compared with 
that set out in the indictment.^) $]

   [$ (^L. Ch. Justice,^) $] [$ (^ (to the Clerk of the 
Arraigns.) ^) $] Are the words (^thirty-five pounds^) , 
both in the reddendum and covenant of 
the counterpart, engrossed in words at 
length; and is there any razure in either 
of them in the lease set out in the 
indictment?
   [$ (^Clerk of Arraigns.^) $] The rent reserved 
in the counter-part is engrossed in words
at length, and there is no razure in the 
lease.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] My Lord, we rest it here.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Justice.^) $] Mr Ayliffe, the counsel 
for the Crown have now gone through 
their evidence; this, therefore, is the time
to make your defence.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] The name to the lease 
is Mr Fox's own hand-writing; that is 
all I know.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Justice.^) $] Have you any witnesses 
to call.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] My Lord, we 
<P 22C2>
beg leave to examine a few witnesses for 
the prisoner. -- Call Gabriel Cruse [$ (^ (Who 
appeared.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Gabriel Cruse.^) $] My Lord, I was 
subpoena'd last Monday at Salisbury, and am 
come up here from the country; I have 
not been paid for my journey or expences; 
therefore, I hope I shall be considered.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Justice.^) $] That is never done in 
cases of felony.

[$ (^Whereupon Gabriel Cruse was sworn.^) $]

   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Do you know 
Mr Fox?
   [$ (^Gabriel Cruse.^) $] I know him: but I have 
very little acquaintance with him.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Do you know 
any thing of a lease executed by him to 
the prisoner? 
   [$ (^Gabriel Cruse.^) $] No: I know nothing 
of his executing a lease.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Did you not 
hear Mr Fox make some declaration 
concerning a lease he had granted to the 
prisoner?
   [$ (^Gabriel Cruse.^) $] He told me that he had 
ordered the prisoner to prepare a lease at 
thirty-five pounds a year; but seemed to 
think that he had been imposed upon; 
for he said the lease, which had since been 
produced to him, was only at five pounds 
a year. -- That is all I know of the matter.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Explain yourself; 
what was it Mr Fox said?
   [$ (^Gabriel Cruse.^) $] He said, that the draft of 
the lease was at thirty-five pounds a year, 
but that he had signed the lease without 
reading it.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Did you ever see 
the lease he was he was speaking of in Mr Fox's 
hands?
   [$ (^Gabriel Cruse.^) $] No: I never did.
<P 23C1>
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Call Adam 
Brown. [$ (^ (Who appeared, and was sworn.) ^) $] 
Are you acquainted with Mr Fox's 
hand-writing?
   [$ (^Adam Brown.^) $] Yes: I know it well.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] How long have 
you been acquainted with it?
   [$ (^Adam Brown.^) $] About a dozen years.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Here, take this 
deed. [$ (^ (The lease set out in the indictment.) ^) $] 
Look at the name H. Fox at the bottom 
of it; do you or do you not believe that 
to be Mr Fox's hand?
   [$ (^Adam Brown.^) $] The first glance of it 
shews a great aukwardness. -- This is 
not Mr Fox's hand, but a very bad 
imitation of it. -- There is a stiffness in this 
that I never observed in Mr Fox's writing. 
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Call Thomas 
Bonnell. [$ (^ (Who appeared, and was sworn.) ^) $] 
Of what profession, Sir, are you?
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] I am an Attorney.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Pray, look at 
this deed [$ (^ (the lease set out in the indictment) ^) ;$]  
did you ever see this in Mr Fox's hands?
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] No, Sir, I never saw 
it before.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did not Mr Fox make some 
acknowledgment to you about it?
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] That was matter of 
private conversation, which I don't know 
whether I am at liberty to repeat. 
   [$ (^L. Ch. Justice.^) $] Raise your voice; I don't 
hear you.
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] Mr Fox asked me if 
I knew any thing about the lease of 
Rusley-Park.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Where was this 
conversation?
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] I attended Mr Fox at 
Holland-House. -- He told me Ayliffe had 
grossly imposed upon him, for he had 
made the rent 5 l. instead of thirty-five 
pounds, and seem to intimate, that he 
looked upon it as a fraud and not a forgery.
<P 23C2> 
He said, he had first intended it should 
be at 40 l. a year; but that being desirous 
Mr Ayliffe should have it upon beneficial 
terms, he had ordered him to make it at 
35 l. That was nearly the sense of what 
passed at that time.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] What time was 
this?
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] About the latter end 
of July, to the best of my remembrance.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Was it before 
or after Mr Clewer had sent Mr Fox the 
lease that was in mortgage to him?
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] I believe it was after 
that. -- I think, Mr Fox told me he had 
seen it; -- but I will not be positive to 
this; -- I am sure he said it was 5 l. 
instead of 35 l.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Prisoner.^) $] Did Mr Fox 
appear to speak of it as an imposition 
upon him, or as a forgery?
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] I believe that Mr Fox 
at this time thought that he had been 
imposed upon, and made to execute a 
lease at 5 l. instead of one at 35 l. as he 
had agreed to.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice, to the counsel for the 
prisoner.^) $] If you build upon Mr Fox's 
opinion or belief concerning this matter, 
you may call him as a witness, and have 
the benefit of his evidence, although they 
are not at liberty to call him on the part 
of the Crown.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Mr Fox, my Lord, 
is near at hand, and will be forth-coming 
if they desire to examine him.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Prisoner.^) $] My Lord, we 
don't desire it?
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Mr Bonnell, are 
you not sure that Mr Fox told you he had 
seen the lease in mortgage to Clewer?
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] I think he told me so, 
but am not certain.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Did he say 
nothing to you about the counterpart?
<P 24C1>   
   [$ (^Thomas Bonnell.^) $] I think he mentioned 
it; but to be particular as to what he said 
I cannot.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Prisoner.^) $] My Lord, we 
beg leave to call some witnesses to the 
prisoner's character.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Justice.^) $] That seems 
unnecessary; for the prisoner's character 
before this particular fact has not been 
impeached; on the contrary, it appears that 
Mr Fox himself, 'till lately, had so good 
an opinion of him, as to employ him to 
be his steward. But proceed in your own 
way.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Call Francis 
Scull. [$ (^ (Who appeared and was sworn.) ^) $] Do 
you know Mr Ayliffe?
   [$ (^Francis Scull.^) $] Yes, I have known him 
a great many years, ever since he lived in 
the parish of Lineham.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] What was his 
general character?
   [$ (^Francis Scull.^) $] I generally looked upon 
him as an honest man. I scarcely ever 
heard any thing to his discredit. -- He 
was formerly steward to Madam Horner; 
and when she died he continued steward to 
Mr Fox.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Did he continue 
Mrs Horner's steward to the time of her 
death? 
   [$ (^Francis Scull.^) $] I don't know whether he 
did or not. -- But I have one particular 
reason to look upon him as a very honest 
man. -- He had, it seems, turned away a 
servant of Mr Fox's, upon which I 
applied to him to desire he would employ 
him again; -- No, says he, I'll not employ 
a servant, or any one, that is not a friend 
to Mr Fox's interest, my honour will not 
let me do it: for Mr Fox's interest is 
concerned, as several persons have made 
complaints of him to me.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Call James 
<P 24C2>
Doleman. [$ (^ (Who appeared and was sworn) ^) $] 
Do you know Mr Ayliffe?
   [$ (^James Doleman.^) $] I do.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] How long have 
you known him? 
   [$ (^James Doleman.^) $] I have known him a 
dozen or fourteen years.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] What was his 
general character?
   [$ (^James Doleman.^) $] He bore a very good 
character during that time; I looked upon 
him as an honest man, and never heard to 
the contrary in all my life.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Call John Tuck.  
[$ (^ (Who appeared and was sworn.) ^) $] Do you 
know Mr Ayliffe?
   [$ (^John Tuck.^) $] Yes, I have known him 
many years.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] What is his 
general character?
   [$ (^John Tuck.^) $] As to his character, as far 
as ever I heard, he is a man of credit and 
reputation.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown,^) $] Where do you 
live?
   [$ (^John Tuck.^) $] At Chippenham in the 
county of Wilts.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] When you speak 
of credit, What do you mean?
   [$ (^John Tuck.^) $] That he is a very honest 
man.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Don't you know 
that he has of late been in very distressed 
circumstances?
   [$ (^John Tuck.^) $] I don't know it.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Mr Tuck, you heard what 
Mr Lodge has sworn against me; did he 
not give me a very good character but a 
week ago?
   [$ (^John Tuck.^) $] I have heard him give 
you a good character.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Call Mr Bradley. 
[$ (^ (Who appeared and was sworn.) ^) $] How long 
have you known Mr Ayliffe?
<P 25C1>   
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I have known him a 
year and an half, or thereabouts?
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Was you not one 
of the subscribing witnesses to the mortgage 
executed by the prisoner to Mr Clewer?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] Yes: I was.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Then look upon 
the back of that deed, [$ (^ (the mortgage) ^) $] and 
tell us whether your name there is of your 
hand-writing?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I will not disown it; 
that is my hand-writing.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Then I suppose 
you was present, and saw the prisoner 
execute it.
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I certainly did?
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Do you 
remember any request made at that time to keep 
this mortgage a secret? 
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I do.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Was it not that 
an oath of secrecy should be taken? 
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I cannot say that. --
I only know that it was desired the 
mortgage might be kept a secret.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Who was it that 
desired it?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I believe it was Mr 
Ayliffe's Attorney.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Did not Mr 
Ayliffe himself desire it?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I don't remember that 
I heard him say any thing about it.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Was Mr Ayliffe 
present when his Attorney desired it?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I believe he was.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Tell us what was 
said about it?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] It was said Mr Fox 
would be very angry, if he knew that 
Rusley-Park was sold or mortgaged; and 
that therefore Mr Ayliffe was desirous it 
should not be talked of.
<P 25C2>
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] Who said all 
this? Ayliffe, or his Attorney?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I really cannot swear 
which of them said it; I only know 
that this was spoke at the time the 
mortgage was executed to Clewer.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] What is the 
Attorney's name?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] Mr Priddle was the 
Attorney; I think it was he repeated 
those words; but I cannot recollect 
positively who it was.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Was it said in my hearing?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] I cannot say you 
heard it. -- You was there when this deed 
was signed.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] Is it an 
unusual thing for a mortgager to desire 
that his being under a necessity to 
incumber his estate should be kept a secret, 
and his circumstances not be exposed?
   [$ (^William Bradley.^) $] No: I conceive that 
it is often desired.
   [$ (^Counsel for the prisoner.^) $] If a mortgage 
is paid off at the time, is there any 
occasion to disclose it at all?

I should think there 
can be none.
   [$ (^Mr Aston.^) $] My Lord, we think it 
unnecessary to reply, or make any 
observations upon the evidence given for the 
prisoner.

   [$ (^My Lord Chief Justice then, in a very
full, clear, and impartial manner, summed 
up the evidence on both sides. After which 
the Jury withdrew for about six minutes, 
and being returned into Court, were called 
over.^) $]
   [$ (^Clerk of the Arraigns.^) $] Gentlemen of 
the Jury, Are you all agreed on your 
verdict?
<P 26C1>
   [$ (^Jury.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Clerk of the Arraigns.^) $] Who shall say 
for you?
   [$ (^Jury.^) $] Our foreman.
   [$ (^Clerk of the Arraigns.^) $] John Ayliffe, 
Hold up your hand [$ (^ (which he did) ^) .$] 
Gentlemen of the Jury, look upon the 
prisoner; how say you, is he guilty of 
the felony and forgery whereof he stands 
indicted, or not guilty?
   [$ (^Foreman.^) $] Guilty.
   [$ (^Clerk of the Arraigns.^) $] What goods or 
chattels, lands or tenements, had he at 
the time of the same felony and forgery 
committed, or at any time since to your 
knowledge?
   [$ (^Foreman.^) $] None.
   [$ (^Clerk of the Arraigns.^) $] Hearken to your 
verdict as the Court has recorded it: 
You say that John Ayliffe is guilty of 
the felony and forgery whereof he stands 
<P 26C2>
indicted, and that he had no goods or 
chattels, lands or tenements, at the time 
of the same felony or forgery committed, 
or at any time since, to your knowledge, 
and so say you all.
   [$ (^Counsel for the Crown.^) $] My Lord, there 
is another indictment found by the Grand 
Jury of the county of Middlesex, against 
the prisoner, for the forging and 
publishing another duplicate of the lease of 
Rusley; upon which we are ready to 
proceed to tryal, but that we think it will 
be taking up the time of the Court 
unnecessarily, as the prisoner is already 
capitally convicted. And, indeed, as a 
second conviction could only serve by way 
of aggravation, we do not desire to throw 
any difficulties in the way to mercy.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] It certainly is unnecessary.
   [$Upon which the prisonner was 
remanded to Newgate.$]
