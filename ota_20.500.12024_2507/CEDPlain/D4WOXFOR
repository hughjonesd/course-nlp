   [$This Informant saith, That last
Night he was at a Neighbour's
House in the (^Northgate-street^) in
(^Oxford^) aforesaid, and hearing a great
Noise of Breaking of Windows, he went
out; and when he came into the Street he
saw a great many Soldiers throwing Stones
at the Windows of Mr. (^Hurst^) the
Ironmonger, being encouraged by an Officer of
the Regiment, whose Name this Informant
knoweth not; and after some time, a
Gentleman, whom this Informant believes was the
Major, said to them,$] (^Come in, Boys, and drink,
and then go out and at it again^) ; [$and
accordingly they did go in with him, and when they
came out again, the Major, pointing to Mr.
(^Hurst's^) House, said to the Soldiers,$] (^Down
with that House, and I will see it out^) ; [$upon
which they throw'd more Stones at Mr.
(^Hurst's^) Windows, and then went up the
Street, and afterwards into the High-Street,
breaking Windows all the way they went,
<P 4>
and afterwards came back to the (^Star^) for
fresh Orders, as they pretended; and after
they had stay'd there some little time, they
went down the (^Northgate-street^) , and thro' the
(^North-gate^) , breaking the Windows all the
way they went, and beating some People.$]

   [$This Informant saith, That he was last
Night standing by the Bonfire against
the (^Star-Inn^) in this City, and there saw a
great many Soldiers breaking Mr. (^Hurst's^)
Windows, and while they were about it, one
of the Lieutenants, whose Name this
Informant believes is (^Hamilton^) , came out and
lighted his Pipe at the Bonfire, and all the
while looking upon them; and when he had
lighted his Pipe, he walked over into the
Lane next Mr. (^Hurst's^) , and the Soldiers
followed him; but what he said to them this
Informant knows not; but said, That the
Soldiers went immediately to gathering up of
Stones, and then went up the Street, and
down the High-Street, all the way breaking
of Windows; And when they came near
<P 5>
Sir (^Daniel Webb's^) House, Sir (^Daniel^) overtook
them, and ask'd them what they meant by
making such a Disturbance? Whereupon
they immediately fell a swearing and cursing,
and several of them stuck him with their
Sticks; and one (^Fosty Magee^) , a Corporal in
the Colonel's Company (as this Informant is
since told he is) drew his Sword, and held it
against Sir (^Daniel^) : Whereupon this
Informant told him Sir (^Daniel^) was a Justice of
the Peace, and one of the Magistrates of the
City: Upon which the said (^Magee^) curs'd Sir
(^Daniel^) , and said, (^He did not care what he was^) ;
further said, (^He was a Rogue and a Rascal^) .
After which, they went over to Mr. Mayor's, and
broke his Windows; and when Mr. Mayor
came out to demand the Reason, several of
them, and particularly the said (^Magee^) , came
up to Mr. Mayor with their drawn Swords;
and further saith, That Mr. Mayor went
with his Mace, and accompany'd Sir (^Daniel
Webb^) to the Major at the (^Star-Inn^) , to
complain of the Disorders by the Soldiers, and
to desire his Assistance; and as they came
away from him this Informant heard the
Major say,$] (^Go to the Devil like a Parcel of^)
Jacobites, (^or I will make you go^) .

   [$This Informant saith, That when
they were lighting the Bonfire, last
Night, against the (^Star-Inn^) , he, this
Informant, shut up his Father's Shop-Windows
(the House being over against the (^Star^) ) and
went in to his Work; and after a very little
time, this Informant's Sister said, (^She heard
the Glass-Windows rattle^) , which this
Informant could not at first believe; but soon after
this Informant heard it himself, and then
went out to see who it was that broke the
Windows; and when he came out, he saw
the Major of the Regiment take up a Stone,
and brake the Windows with it; upon
which this Informant said,$] Sir, (^I will take a
Note of your Name^) ; [$whereupon the Major
drew his Sword, and ran after this
Informant, and said,$] (^Damn you, will you take
Notice of Names^) ? [$But this Informant ran
into his Father's House, and lock'd the Door
before the Major could overtake him; but
they still continu'd to break the Windows,
which, after some time, provok'd this
Informant to go out again, and then he saw the
Major throw a Fire-Stick from the Bonfire
at his Father's Windows; and did at the
<P 7>
same time likewise see the Tapster at the
(^Star-Inn^) , and one (^Edward West^) , the
under-Tapster, throw Firesticks at, and broke the
said Windows; and further saith, they broke
a great deal of (^China-Ware^) , and that one of
the Firesticks hung in the Window-Curtain,
and that there was no Person in the House
besides this Informant's Mother, his two
