OF THE REVEREND JUDGES OF THAT COURT, HOLDEN AT WESTMINSTER, THE 6TH

<P 12>
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Pray, my Lord, give me your Favour, I      #
would not
<P 13>
interrupt you; but to make things clear as we go, I desire to ask    #
you,
when you came first to Mr. (^Hambden's^) House, who spake first,     #
when you
were all met together?
   [$ (^Lord Howard,^) $] Every body discoursed what they pleased.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] But who gave an Account of the Reason of the 
Meeting? Will you please to recollect, and tell what you know who    #
began 
the Discourse?
   [$ (^Lord Howard.^) $] Something introductive to it was said by Mr. 
(^Hambden^) , we being at his House, as 'tis natural to conceive for #
any
Gentleman at whose House People are met, to say, Pray let us sit     #
down, and
talk of our Business. Something leading and introductive was said by
him.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Pray, my Lord, as near as you can          #
remember, will you
give an Account what was the thing he began to discourse of? Did he
seem to take any Notice, or have any Knowledge of your Meeting, and
other things before?
   [$ (^Lord Howard,^) $] It was a general Hint and Intimation to us #
of the Ends
of our Meeting, that we were there come to consult and advise one
with another how to put things into a better Method and Posture than
formerly: And he desired that we would sit down and discourse of
these things. My Lord, I would not charge my self with Particulars
positively.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] Upon what Questions did you debate and  #
consult,
my Lord?
   [$ (^Lord Howard,^) $] Those were started severally. Some would   #
speak of
the Time when it should be, whether it were not convenient now or
when? Others offered something concerning the Places, whether it
should be begun in the City or in the Country, or both together. 
Others took it into Consideration what Persons were to be prepared in
the several Countreys to be assisting in it that were probable to    #
carry
it on. And then some discoursed concerning the raising of Money, 
and then what summ should be raised, and I think that was started by
the Duke of (^Monmouth^) ; but I am sure the summ that he named was 20
or 30000 (^l.^) The last thing that was talked of, but which was
concluded to be the thing principally to be taken care of, was the   #
setling such
a Concurrence and Correspondence with (^Scotland^) that they might   #
chime
in at the same time, that so we might give as many diversions both
from home and abroad as could be at one and the same time.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord (^Howard^) , Did Mr. (^Hambden^)   #
discourse of this
matter?
   [$ (^Lord Howard,^) $] I cannot speak to the Discourse of any one #
in 
particular; for I cannot say it was put to the Vote as we formerly   #
express it,
but it may be said we were all consenting and concurring.
   [$ (^Lord Ch. Just,^) $] Did any of you dissent from the Riseing?
   [$ (^Lord Howard,^) $] No, no my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did any of you oppose it at all?
   [$ (^Lord Howard,^) $] No, no, That was discoursed of as a thing  #
resolved.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] I ask you this Question, my Lord (^Howard^) ,  #
Was there any sort
of Complaint made of the Government, That it was uneasie and that
occasioned you to enter into these debates?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] There was I cannot say a Complaint, because  #
there was
no Person to complain to; but it was spoken of as a matter of great
<P 14>
grievance, that such a Force and Violence should be put upon the     #
City in
their Election of Officers, and the tendency of that as to all       #
Juryes tho'
I cannot distinctly remember the particular things.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You say you were talking of a Messenger to be  #
sent into
(^Scotland^) to my Lord of (^Argyle^) and others to chime in with    #
you in this
matter as you say, pray did you come to any Resolution about that, and
what did you resolve upon?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] That there should be one only at that time.  #
And
afterwards it was the matter of the debate at the next Meeting,      #
which was
that Meeting at my Lord (^Russels^) , which was about this time
twelve-month in (^February^) sometime.
   [$Mr. (^A. Gen.^) $] How long after the first Meeting at Mr.      #
(^Hambden's^) was that?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] My Lord, I think it was about a fortnight.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Who was there?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] The same Persons that met before. But then   #
there was
little spoken of but the Business of (^Scotland^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was Mr. (^Hambden^) there at the second Meeting?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] He was there.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] At my Lord (^Russels^) you say it was?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What Resolution did you come to then?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] Then we came to a Resolution that some Body  #
should be
sent, and we began to discourse who was fit, and Col. (^Sidney^) he
propounded (^Aaron Smith^) , to some of the Company he was known, to #
others not;
but those that did know him did approve of him as a fit Person. 
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] To whose Province was that comitted of     #
sending this
Person into (^Scotland^) ?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] Col. (^Sidney^) undertook it himself.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did the rest consent to it?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] Yes, no body did oppose it; but left it to   #
him.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you Name the Person then that was to go?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] He was not so named as to be with any        #
solemnity
approved or disproved; but it was left to Col. (^Sidney^) to manage  #
it, and he
naming (^Smith^) as a fit Person (he told us that by the by not to   #
put it
to the Question for our Approbation) and some of us knew the Person,
others did not. I was one that did know him, and did think him a     #
very fit
Man to send.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray, my Lord, who was the Person? Be pleased  #
to tell the
Jury so as they may know it. [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] (^Aaron Smith.^)
   [$Mr. (^J. Withins,^) $] Had you any discourse with Col.          #
(^Sidney^) , my Lord, 
afterwards that he was sent? [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray give an account of that?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] About three or four days after this Meeting  #
at my Lord
(^Russels^) , I went to Visit Col. (^Sidney^) at his House, and      #
while I was there
in the Room, he went to his Cabinet, and out of a Drawer where there
was five or six hundred pound in Gold as I could guess, he took a good
many pieces, I do not know directly how many; but he took out so
many as he said was threescore Guineys that he was going to carry to #
(^Aaron
Smith^) , I went not in my own Coach, and therefore went away with him
in his Coach, and he set me down at (^Southampton Street^) at my own
Lodging. I went no further, but he did, and he told me afterwards it #
was
conveyed to him, and that he did go.
<P 15>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How long was that after your second Meeting at #
my Lord (^Russels^) where you
say you intrusted Col. (^Sidney^) to send one into (^Scotland^) ?
   [$ (^L. Howard,^) $] I think it may be less then a Week, four or  #
five days, that I saw him
carry the Money. After this he said, he had given him this Money,    #
and was gone:
And when he was dispatched, in a Week after I was making enquiries   #
after him, and
Col. (^Sidney^) said, he had not heard of him since he went away;    #
but about a fortnight
or three Weeks Col. (^Sidney^) said he had heard of him, That he was #
at (^New-Castle^) and
stay'd there; but he wondered he could hear no more of him. I then   #
went into 
(^Essex^) , and when I came back from thence, he told me, he was     #
come, but I had never
seen him, not to this day, indeed I had once appointed a Meeting     #
with him at Mr.
(^West's^) Chamber; but something or other happened, we did not meet.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] We have done with my Lord (^Howard^) , if  #
they will ask him any
Questions they may.
   [$ (^L. Ch. J.^) $] They know their time, when the Kings Attorney #
has done with any
Witness then they may examine him, if they please. If they will not  #
call your other
Witnesses. [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Will you ask him any Questions?
   [$ (^Mr. Jones.^) $] No, no, by advice they are to ask him nothing.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] We shall give your Lordship and the Jury  #
an account in the next place,
that we have traced (^Aaron Smith^) into (^Scotland^) . And for that #
we shall call some
Witnesses which indeed we did not produce before at any Tryal,       #
because we had not then
discovered so much. We shall bring you the Person at whose House he  #
lay at
(^New-Castle^) , and the very Messenger that was sent with him to    #
conduct him a by-way into
(^Scotland^) . Call (^Sheriffe^) and (^Bell^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Look you Gentlemen, You that are at the Bar,   #
there you must let the Jury
stand by themselves. I see there are a great many others             #
intermingled with them, and
you Gentlemen of the Jury, If any whisperer talk to you, we expect   #
that you should
tell us who they are; for we will suffer no remarks to be made but   #
what are openly
made to the Court, and the Jury by the Counsel of both sides.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Swear (^Sheriffe^) and (^Bell^) .          #
[$ (which was done) $]
   [$M. (^Williams,^) $] What is this Man's Name Mr. (^Att.^) ?      #
Friend what is your Name?
   [$ (^Witness,^) $] My Name is (^Sheriffe^) ,
   [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] Pray give my Lord and the Jury an account   #
What you know of any
Person that lay at your house some time since and whether you have   #
seen him since? My Lord
this Gentleman did not know (^Aaron Smith^) before, and therefore I  #
desire Mr. (^Atterbury^) 
may be called and examined again. Mr. (^Atterbury^) , do you know    #
(^Aaron Smith^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Atterbury,^) $] Yes, I know him very well.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Had this Gentleman a view of (^Aaron       #
Smith^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Atterbury,^) $] Yes, he had. He was brought where (^Aaron #
Smith^) was, and this
other Person was by before him too, and I was by when they had a     #
view of him.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Now pray give an accompt what you know of  #
the man you saw?
   [$Mr. (^Sol. Gen.^) $] Where is (^Aaron Smith^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Atterbury,^) $] He is in the Kings Bench Prison, and he   #
was brought by (^ (\Habeas Corpus\) ^)
to (^White-hall^) before the King. where these two persons were      #
brought likewise [^SOURCE TEXT: ikewise^] , and
there this man (^Sheriffe^) did own that (^Aaron Smith^) was the man #
that was at his house; 
and the other (^Bell^) owned that he travelled towards (^Scotland^)  #
with him, and that he
was hired to shew him the way into (^Scotland^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did (^Aaron Smith^) say any thing?
   [$Mr. (^Atterbury,^) $] He would not Answer any thing at all, nor #
say a word.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray give an account Mr. (^Sheriffe^) ,    #
who it was that lay at your House,
and when it was, and what he said was his Business, and by what name #
he went?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] Indeed his Business I did not know; but he #
was at our House about the
middle of (^February^) , it was thereabouts.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] When was it? what (^February^) ?               #
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] The last (^February^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] You say he was at your House last          #
(^February^) , pray tell the Court where
that is? [$Mr. (^Sheriff,^) $] At (^New-castle^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Do you keep any Inn there?                 #
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What Sign? [$Mr. (^Sheriffe.^) $] The Sign #
of the (^Black-spread Eagle^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] And what did he do there?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] He stayed there one Night and went away,   #
and returned again in twelve
days or thereabouts, and came to my House again.
<P 16>
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Whither did he go from you?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe.^) $] He went (^Southward^) as I suppose, I know #
no further.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] But when he first came to your House,      #
which way went he?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe.^) $] He went (^Northward^) towards              #
(^Scotland^) , as he himself said, And
desired to have one to shew him the way: And I sent for this Man,    #
and when he came to
him he hired him to go with him, and I was by.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] When he first came to your house about the     #
middle of (^February^) was twelve
month, Whither was he bound then, (^Northward^) or (^Southward^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] He was going to (^Scotland^) , that is     #
(^Northward^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] And you say after he came back again, and lay  #
another Night at your house.
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] Yes, ten or twelve days after he did.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] And which way went he then?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] Then he came (^Southwards^) towards        #
(^London^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you take exact notice of the Man?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] Yes, I saw him before his Majesty and the  #
Council.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] And upon your Oath that same man you saw there #
was the same man that                                                #
lodged at your house in (^February^) was 12 month?
[$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] Yes, it is.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What name did he go by at your house?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] He went under the name of Mr. (^Clerke^) , #
but what his Sirname was I 
can't tell. [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Had he a servant with him?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] He had a man with him that stay'd at our   #
house during the time of
his going (^Northward^) ? [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What did he call    #
his name.
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] (^Wil. Langston.^) 
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did he desire you to furnish him with a    #
guide?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] He told me his Servant did not know the    #
way, and his horse was a 
little lamish, and desired me to get a guide for him. For after he   #
had dined at our
house it happened to be a rainy day, and he could not go further     #
that night, and 
therefore desired me to get him a man that knew that Countrey, and I #
sent for this same
man, and he hired him; and he went along with him next morning, my   #
Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Whither was he to go?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] Truly I did not know; but he told me he    #
did not know the way into
(^Scotland^) , and I directed him to a Gentlemans house at           #
(^Jadbrough^) in the way.
   [$ (^Lord Ch. Just.^) $] Is that the Road to (^Scotland^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] Yes, the high Road to one part of          #
(^Scotland^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did he tell you to what part or place of       #
(^Scotland^) he was to go?
   [$Mr. (^Sheriffe,^) $] He named the West of (^Scotland^) , I      #
think he named (^Douglas^) , but I do not  
know what place certainly he designed for. [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $]     #
Then where is (^Bell^) ?
   [$ (^Bell,^) $] Here. [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] Had you a view of     #
this man they call (^Aaron Smith^) ?
   [$ (^Bell,^) $] Yes, I had.
   [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] Give an accompt, whether you saw him in the #
North and when and where.
   [$ (^Bell,^) $] This man, Mr. (^Sheriffe^) , sent for me. I live  #
at (^New-Castle^) and there I keep
Hackney Horses to serve any Gentlemen, or be a Guide to them as      #
there is occasion, and Mr.
(^Sheriffe^) sent for me, and when I came he told me the Gentleman   #
wanted a Guide into
(^Scotland^) . We immediately agreed, it was upon Thursday night     #
before that we call (^Easter 
Eve^) . [$ (^Lord Ch. Just.^) $] When was it say you?
   [$ (^Bell,^) $] It was the Thursday before (^Easters-Even^) , so  #
they call it with us, that is
(^Shrove-Tuesday^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Ay, they call it so in those places, because   #
'tis the Even of the Fast of
(^Ash-wednesday^) , the beginning of Lent -- Well go on.
   [$ (^Bell,^) $] We went away on Friday the next morning on our    #
Journey towords
(^Jadbrough^) , and the 2d day which was Saturday in the afternoon   #
my horse tired,
whereupon he left me with my horse and took the Mans man of the      #
house where he left me
to guide him, for my horse would not ride up with him being tired,   #
and he resolving to
go on, and he bid me follow him on the Sunday morning to             #
(^Jadbrough^) Town, which
I did, and we stayed there all Sunday. And on Monday morning I saw   #
him take horse
and another man that was his guide, and away they went, as I think,  #
he said towards
(^Douglas^) he was going. And he pay'd me, and I returned again from #
him to (^New-Castle^)
and left him.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray how far was this, you say you went with   #
him to (^Jadbrough^) , how far
distant is that from (^New-Castle^) ?
<P 17>
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] To (^Jadbrough^) my Lord? [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $]   #
Yes.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] 'Tis (^Forty^) Miles my Lord.                     #
[$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] How near (^Scotland^) is it?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] 'Tis within some (^six^) Miles of the (^English^) #
Border.  
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Did you see him at any time after that?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] I saw him at his coming back again; being at      #
(^Sheriffs^) house, his
Wife asked me if I would go up and see the Gentleman that I went with
towards (^Scotland^) : So I went up, and he made me eat and drink at #
the Table
with him.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] What Name did he go by?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] He went by the name of (^Clerk^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Was there any Servant with him?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] There was a Man that came with him as a Servant   #
there, and was all
the time at (^New-Castle^) , that he was gone towards (^Scotland^) , #
till he came back
again.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Mr. (^Attorney^) , Did this Man see         #
(^Smith^) at the time the other saw him?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Yes, I did.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] And is that the Man that went by the name   #
of (^Clerk^) at
(^New-Castle^) , and that you went with towards (^Scotland^) ?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Yes, It is.
   [$ (^Mr. Atterbury.^) $] And when they charged him with it,       #
(^Aaron Smith^) did not
deny it.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did you go any by-Road to get into        #
(^Scotland^) ?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] No, 'tis the Road Gentlemen usually go to         #
(^Jadbrough^) , and so on; 
because 'tis something the nearer way to that part of (^Scotland^) , #
as we judge it
to be, therefore Gentlemen use it.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Is it an high-open-Road?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Yes, 'tis the high-open Way to that part of the   #
Country.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord (^Howard^) , Pray were the Names  #
of any of the
(^Scotch-men^) mentioned at your Meeting, that were to be sent for?
   [$L. (^Howard.^) $] Yes; There was my Lord (^Melvin^) , Sir       #
(^John Cockram^) , and one
(^Cambell^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Now, my Lord, We will give you an         #
account, That as (^Smith^)
went into (^Scotland^) , so these persons soon after came into       #
(^England^) .
   [$ (^Jury-Man.^) $] My Lord, We desire that my Lord (^Howard^)    #
would name those
(^Scotch-men^) that were to come.
   [$L. (^Howard.^) $] There was my Lord (^Melvin^) , Sir (^John     #
Cockram^) , and one (^Cambel^) ,
one that was of my Lord (^Argyles^) Name and Family; and there was   #
another
Name, but I can't remember what that Name was.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] We shall give you an Account, my Lord,    #
That they came
immediately after this to Town; and at the breaking out of the Plot, #
they
Absconded.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Mr. (^Attorney^) , Has my Lord (^Howard^)   #
his Pardon?
   [$ (^Mr. Attorney.^) $] Yes, my Lord, he has.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Then your Lordship may be covered.
   [$L. (^Howard.^) $] I can't tell, but they may ask me some        #
Questions.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Then you may be uncovered when they ask   #
them, in the
mean time your Lordship may be covered. Swear Sir (^Andrew Foster^)  #
[$ (which
was done.) $] Pray Sir, will you tell my Lord and the Jury what you  #
know
about the (^Cambell's^) , and Sir (^John Cockram's^) being in Town?  #
Or any other
(^Scotch-men^) that you know of?
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster.^) $] My Lord, I did see those Gentlemen in #
the beginning of
last Summer. Sir (^John Cockram^) , and Mr. (^Monrow^) , and         #
(^Cambell^) the Son, I did
see; but the Father I did not, but I do know he was in Town, tho I   #
saw him
not.
<P 18>
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] How do you know it?
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster.^) $] I had Messages from them.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Sir (^Andrew^) , You say, you saw Sir       #
(^John Cockram^) , and (^Monrow^) ?
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster;^) $] Yes. [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Did you    #
see any body else?
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster.^) $] I saw Sir (^George Campell^) the Son.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] What became of them upon the Discovery of #
the Plot?
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster.^) $] Sir (^John Cockram^) did Abscond, and #
Mr. (^Monrow^) was taken
into Custody.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] What became of the others?
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster.^) $] The (^Campells^) were both in Custody.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did you see any Commission they had?
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster.^) $] I did see a Commission that Sir       #
(^John Cockram^) had.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] What was it for?
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster.^) $] To make a Purchase of some            #
Plantations beyond Sea, I
think it was (^Carolina^) .
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Ay, where my Lord (^Shaftsbury^) had an     #
Interest.
   [$Sir (^Andrew Foster.^) $] It was some of the (^West-Indies^) .
   [$L. (^Howard.^) $] I did omit that passage my Lord --
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray was it discoursed then, what should  #
be the Blind for
these Gentlemen that were notorious Dissenters, that they should     #
come to
Town from (^Scotland^) about?  
   [$L. (^Howard.^) $] It was to carry on a Plantation in            #
(^Carolina^) . The (^Scotch^) 
Gentlemen were personally known to my Lord (^Russel^) only; and my   #
Lord (^Russel^)
was to write the Letter to them, and, I suppose, did.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Mr. (^Atterbury^) , What do you know of   #
these (^Scotch-men^) 
coming to Town; and what became of them afterwards?
   [$Mr. (^Atterbury.^) $] My Lord, about the beginning of (^July,   #
Fourth, Fifth^) , or
(^Sixth^) , or thereabouts, I had some Information, That there were  #
some (^Scotch^)
Gentlemen that had been shifting up and down, and at that time were  #
about
(^Black-Fryers^) , lodged there secretly. I immediately went with    #
the King's
Proclamation, and some Warrants that I had to apprehend some         #
Traytors that
were fled: And when I came, I found that Mr. (^Common Serjeant^)     #
having
Notice of them, had beat up their Quarters, and they were endeavouring
to escape by Water; but there they were catched. There was Sir (^Hugh
Campel^) , and (^Bayley^) , and Sir (^George Campel^) , and some     #
others, I know not the Names
of them all; truly I can't tell whether (^Monrow^) was not another,  #
but Sir (^Hugh
Campel^) I had in my Custody, and (^Bayley^) was immediately         #
committed to the
(^Gate-house^) ; and the rest of the Gentlemen I afterwards took in  #
a cunning Hole by
(^Moor-Fields^) , in a back house. And when I came there, I found    #
them lyeing
on the Bed in the middle of the Day; and had them Prisoners in my
Custody two or three Months; and then they were all sent out of my   #
hands into
(^Scotland^) Prisoners. Six of them there were, my Lord, that I saw.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] We have done my Lord, only we desire that #
a word of a
Record may be read.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] What Record is it Sir?
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Of Collonel (^Sidneys^) Attainder.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord, We shall desire your Judgment,    #
whether that
Record ought to be read against Mr. (^Hambden^) ; I perceive by Mr.  #
(^Attorney^) , that 'tis
a Record of the Conviction of Mr. (^Sidney^) , which ought not to be #
given in
Evidence against Mr. (^Hambden^) upon this Indictment.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] We make use of it, to shew how upon       #
former Tryals, upon
this Evidence, Verdicts have gone.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] We are in your Judgment, my Lord, if by    #
Law it may be
given in Evidence against Mr. (^Hambden^) , who is neither Party nor #
Privy to it, 
nor Indicted for the same Offence.
<P 19>
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Let it alone then.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Well, Mr. (^Attorney^) does not press it.   #
What say you to it, 
Gentlemen, for the Defendant?
[^MR WILLIAMS' LONG SPEECH OMITTED: HE ARGUES THERE IS NO-ONE LEFT TO 
CONTRADICT LORD HOWARD'S TESTIMONY, THERE ARE NO FACTS TO SUPPORT 
HOWARD'S ACCUSATIONS, AND THAT HOWARD HAS INVENTED LIES ABOUT A 
CONSPIRACY IN ORDER TO SECURE A PARDON FOR HIMSELF.^]
<P 21>
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] What do you mean by that, Mr. (^Williams^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] By being a Witness against the Defendant   #
and others, he has
procured his own Pardon.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] That is a little harsh Expression --
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord, I explain my self thus --
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] 'Tis an harsh Word, and too roundly         #
expressed; You had need
to explain your self; 'Tis a little too rank, as though the King's   #
Pardon were
to be procured by Blood.
[^MR WILLIAMS' LONG SPEECH OMITTED: HE ARGUES THAT HOWARD IS AN 
UNRELIABLE WITNESS AS HE FIRST SWORE THERE WAS NO CONSPIRACY, THEN 
INVENTED A FURTHER CONSPIRACY TO SECURE HIMSELF A PARDON, AND HAS 
SINCE ADMITTED E.G. THAT LORD RUSSEL WAS INNOCENT. MOREOVER, WILLIAMS 
SAYS ALL THE EVIDENCE ABOUT SMITH HAS NO RELEVANCE TO HAMBDEN'S CASE 
AS HAMBDEN WAS MERELY PRESENT WHEN SMITH'S MISSION WAS MENTIONED.^]
<P 23>
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] And consented to it?
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] I would not strain any thing my Lord,      #
further than the
Evidence is.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] Nor do not Misrepeat it neither.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] I design not any such thing, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] But you do though: For he Swears it, every  #
one of them
consented.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] By silence it must be then. For he does    #
not say, That he said
any thing. He Swears only Collonel (^Sidney^) undertook to manage    #
it, to
send a Person; and my Lord (^Russel^) to write the Letter.
   [$ (^L. C. Just.^) $] And all the rest Consented to it.
<P 24>
[^MR WILLIAMS' LONG SPEECH OMITTED: HE ARGUES THAT THE CASE AGAINST 
SMITH IS NOT PROVED, NOR IS IT PROVED THAT HAMBDEN CONSENTED TO 
SMITH'S MISSION. MOREOVER, HAMBDEN IS A SOBER, STUDIOUS, CHARACTER 
WHO LIVES A RETIRED LIFE AND HAS SPENT MUCH TIME ABROAD DUE TO 
ILL-HEALTH, INCLUDING DURING MUCH OF THE CONSPIRACY.^]
   [$Mr. (^VVallop.^) $] My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I       #
desire to make one
Observation, before we call our Witnesses.
<P 25>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray do not take up our time altogether in     #
Speeches, but go on
to your Evidence.
   [$Mr. (^Wallop.^) $] I desire to observe but one thing, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Make your Observations at last, but spend not  #
our time in
Speeches. I know you will expect to be heard at last, and so you shall
whatever you will say.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Call the Earl of (^Anglesey^) , the Lord   #
of (^Clare^) , and Lord (^Paget^) .
Mr. (^Ducas^) . [$ (who appearing was sworn) $] Now we have him here #
we
must begin with him, my Lord. Mr. (^Ducas^) , Pray what did you hear #
my
Lord (^Howard^) say at any time concerning this Conspiracy, and who  #
were
concerned in it, and who were not?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] My Lord (^Howard^) came once to the house of  #
Colonel (^Sidney^) ,
I believe it was about 8 days after the Imprisonment of Colonel      #
(^Sidney^) ,
and when he was in the house, I ask't him, What is the matter my Lord?
he did answer me, he was told there was a Plot against the King and  #
the 
Duke, and one general Insurrection to be made, and that Colonel      #
(^Sidney^) 
sent a man into (^Scotland^) , to which thing my Lord (^Howard^)     #
sware laying
his hand on his breast, saying, (^God knows all things, and God      #
knows I know
nothing of that; and I am sure if Colonel^) Sidney (^had known any   #
thing, he would
tell me^) ; and I said, what is the matter, my Lord? are you afraid? #
and he
made answer to me, (^No honest man is safe in his own house, I pray  #
you lend
me a Bed to lie in^) . And he asked me about the Goods of Colonel    #
(^Sidney^) ,
because of the Plot and such things, and he desired to have them     #
removed
to his house; and he said, rather then go to the Tower he would do any
thing. [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Speak again to the Jury that did not   #
hear you, what
said my Lord (^Howard^) to you?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] He said, rather then to be a Prisoner again   #
he would do any
thing. [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Who to be a Prisoner again?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] My Lord (^Howard^) . [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $]   #
What things were
spoken of? [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] He said he would do any thing.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Were you speaking of the Conspiracy? Of    #
the Plot?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] He spake of the Plot, and said he knew        #
nothing of it.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] What did he say Sir?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] He said to me and swore, he knew nothing of   #
it, and called
God to witness.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Pray did he then say he would do any thing #
rather then
go to the (^Tower^) , when you were talking of the Plot and          #
Conspiracy?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] Yes, he would do any thing rather then be a   #
Prisoner again.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray what did he say?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] He raised up his hands on high, and said, he  #
knew nothing
of the Plot, or of the Insurrection, or that Colonel (^Sidney^) had  #
sent any
man into (^Scotland^) . [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] When was this?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] I believe it was 8 or 9 days after the        #
Imprisonment of Colonel
(^Sidney^) . [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] What day of the Month, and what #
Month was it?
   [$Mr. (^Ducas.^) $] He was Imprisoned about the end of (^June^) .
   [$L. (^Howard.^) $] My Lord, It would be necessary that I should  #
make an answer
to this, and I know not whether I should make a particular answer to #
every
one: for here is a whole set of Witnesses, I see.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] No, let them alone. You must not interrupt     #
them, they must
go on with their Evidence; and when 'tis a fit time for you to       #
answer them,
the Council for the King will call you.
    [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Pray sware Mr. (^Howard^) [$ (which was   #
done) $] Pray Sir,
<P 26> 
will you please to acquaint my Lord and the Jury what you know, of
what my Lord (^Howard^) has said of the Plot, and who were concerned #
in it?
   [$Mr. (^Howard,^) $] My Lord, what I have said is in the Paper of #
Mr. (^Sidney's^)
Tryal, and truly I can say no more than what I said there.
   [$Mr. (^Williams,^) $] pray speak out Sir, and tell it again to   #
this Jury.
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] I was told I spake it very loud then.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray Sir speak as you please, We wont direct   #
you in what
Key you shall speak. Speak in what Key you will.
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] Then if you will have me speak it, I will    #
speak it as loud
again. My Lord, is Mr. (^Hambden^) here?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Yes, there he is.
   [$Mr. (^Howard,^) $] In the first place I do not know Mr.         #
(^Hambden^) , My Lord,
I cannot promise to speak the very words that I spake the last time, I
cannot make them so fit as one tally fits another.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Consider, Sir, you were not Sworn then,   #
you are Sworn
now, That is the difference, and therefore pray consider of it.
   [$Mr. (^Howard,^) $] My Lord, As near as I can, I will repeat the #
same words again, I
had little Acquaintance with my Lord (^Howard^) ; But meeting him    #
often at
my Brothers House, (and being he was extraordinary pleasant Company,
I must needs say that he was so, and a Man of great Wit) and I coming
from (^White-Hall^) , he asked me what news of the Plot? I told him  #
there
were some People that were in the Proclamation, or would be, and I
named their Names. Says he, I know none of them except (^Rombald^) , #
I
think; and by chance I met him passing through the Old Exchange, and
he saluted me very kindly. After this my Lord (^Russel^) was taken,  #
and
when my Lord (^Howard^) heard that, says he, then we are all undone. #
And
I very much fear it is a Sham Plot, since they have seized upon my   #
Lord,
and I doubt he is a lost man. After that, I think as near as I can
remember -- The next thing was this -- If you look upon the Book,
you will see what I said there.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] We are not to look upon the Book, man. You     #
must give your
Evidence your self Mr. (^Howard^) , I hope you do not Swear by Book? #
Let
the truth come out in Gods Name, whatever it be.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Ay, my Lord, We desire to have truth come  #
out.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Ay, whether it be of one side, or the other,   #
God forbid but truth
should be spoken. Mr. (^Howard^) go on.
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] Then my Lord Colonel, (^Sidney^) was taken,  #
and says my Lord,
I am extremely troubled for Colonel (^Sidney^) , for he is my very   #
good Friend.
said I, why are you not concerned for my Lord (^Russel^) ? He is of  #
your
Blood, says he, he is a man without exceptions. There is no man of   #
such
honor as he, but I am concerned for Colonel (^Sidney^) as that       #
particular man
that has obliged me above all the World, but I never heard my Lord
(^Howard^) name Mr. (^Hambden^) in all my life.
   [$Lord (^Howard.^) $] I'le [^SOURCE TEXT: Il'e^] give you a       #
reason for it My Lord, if you please, why
I said so.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] My Lord, This is Evidence for the Defendant.   #
If the Kings
Counsel will call you afterwards to make Answer to any of these      #
things, 
then is your time to speak. We will not let them interrupt you when  #
you
come to speak, nor must you interrupt them now. We are bound to hear
both sides, and so by the grace of God we will do.
   [$Lord (^Howard.^) $] My Lord, I desire both he and his Brother   #
may stay in
Court, for I have something to say to them.
<P 27>
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Pray what did you hear my Lord (^Howard^)  #
say
concerning the Plot?
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] He did deny it possitively, and said they    #
acted nothing
but what was Legal, and he said it 500 times over.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Did he deny it? [$Mr. (^Howard,^) $] Yes   #
he did.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] But when he said they acted nothing but        #
legally, what did he
mean? Was this Plot legal?
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] I had former Discourses with my Lord         #
(^Howard^) at other
times, and I asked him; My Lord, what tends all this to? Your going up 
into the City and making these meetings? says he, we intend nothing  #
but
what is legal. There is not one man in the Company that I know of, 
intends any thing else. 
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] What was my Lord's Opinion of the Plot in  #
(^June^) or
(^July^) , or (^August^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] He said he knew nothing of it, nor could he  #
believe there
was any such thing. When those Persons were named that were to kill
the King, (^Lord Bless me^) , said he, (^can there be such a thing   #
in nature, that any
men should be so wicked, but that there is one man of Honor or       #
Estate, or
Conscience that ever had any such thought, it can never into my      #
Head, I can never
believe it^) . [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] When was this?
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] When (^Rombald^) and those other People were #
put into the
Proclamation.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Mr. (^Howard^) , Then I will ask you your #
Opinion, whether
in your Judgment, every man that was in the Plot could not have said #
so
much?
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] I suppose every man in the Plot would have   #
defended
himself as well as he could, but I cannot tell what way.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson.^) $] Sir, did he barely affirm it, or with      #
Asseverations and
Imprecations?
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] My Lord, was not upon his Oath before me.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Mr. (^Howard^) . Don't you believe a      #
great many that were
concerned in this Plot would deny it?
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] I am to give my Opinion only for my self,    #
not for
other People.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Have you done with him? [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] #
Yes my Lord. 
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Then go over Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Howard.^) $] My Lord, I am troubled with Fumes, and       #
cannot well
endure a Crowd, therefore I desire I may have leave to be gone.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You may go if you please.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Call Mr. (^Edward Howard^) , [$ (but he    #
did not appear) $]
Then Swear my Lord of (^Clare^) and my Lord (^Paget^) ,
[$ (which was done) $] 
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Well what do you ask my Lord of (^Clare^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord of (^Clare^) , Will your Lordship  #
please to acquaint
the Court and the Jury, what you heard my Lord (^Howard^) say        #
concerning
the late Conspiracy?
   [$E. of (^Clare.^) $] My Lord, Some indisposition I have had of   #
late, together
with the great rigour of the season has confined me to my House this #
six
Weeks, so that I should not come here but upon this Summons of a     #
(^ (\Subpoena\) ^) ,
which I thought I ought not to refuse. I suppose I need not repeat   #
much
of what was said at Colonel (^Sidney's^) Tryal.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] My Lord, You must give what Evidence you have  #
to give now,
<P 28>
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord, The Gentlemen of this Jury have   #
not heard
it, therefore you must say it all over again to them.
   [$E. of (^Clare.^) $] Sometime after Mr. (^Sidney^) was taken, my #
Lord (^Howard^)
came to see me, and complaining of the Times, said, That all things  #
were
very sad and dangerous, and if ever he was questioned again, he      #
would not
Plead, but desire them only to count Noses, for the quickest         #
dispatch he
thought was best: I replyed, sure his Lordship was in jest. He said, #
No,
he was in earnest, for he was confident if he came to Tryal, they    #
would have
his Life, let him appear never so innocent. I said, I hoped not so,  #
it was
only his Lordships fear, and because of that, I thought it might be
presumed he would venture much, rather then be Tryed. And            #
discoursing of
the late Primate of (^Armagh's^) Prophecy; He said, for his part, he #
thought
the Persecution was already begun, and he did believe it would be very
sharp, but withal, he hoped it would be but short; and then he began #
to
wish himself beyond Sea till the Troubles were over; and in complyance
with his Lordship I did wish so too. But as to (^Sidney^) , he did   #
with great
asseverations very much assert his innocency. He said, he thought he #
was
not guilty of any of the things laid to his Charge; and spake with   #
large
Encomiums in his praise, as he had obligation to do, and seemed to   #
bemoan
his misfortunes; which I said I had then reason to believe he was    #
real in,
for I believe never any man was more engaged to another then he to
Colonel (^Sidney^) . I told him there was a discourse of some        #
Writings of Mr.
(^Sidneys^) that were taken; he said he was confident they could make
nothing of any Writing of his; I told him, I supposed he meant       #
legally they
could not do it, This was the most he said, as to Mr. (^Hambden^) , he
mentioned nothing that I know of.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Did he seem to declare any Opinion about   #
the Plot or
Conspiracy in general, That there was any such thing or not?
   [$E. of (^Clare.^) $] I do not remember it.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord of (^Clare^) , Did you never hear #
my Lord (^Howard^)
before this complain of the Government that it was amiss, and was to #
be
rectified?
   [$Earl of (^Clare.^) $] Yes, he often did complain. Every body    #
knows my
Lord's way of discourse.
   [$Lord. (^Howard.^) $] Pray will you ask him, if my Lord of       #
(^Clare^) used to fall
out with me upon those discourses.
   [$E. of (^Clare.^) $] My Lord was always good Company.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] You mean (^ (\a Propos\) ^) , My Lord.
   [$E. of (^Clare.^) $] I understand what you mean by               #
(^ (\a Propos\) ^) , you are a
Learned man, I know.
   [$ (^Mr. Soll. Gen.^) $] My Lord of (^Clare^) , if I apprehend    #
your Lordship aright,
my Lord (^Howard^) was discoursing of the Primate of (^Armagh's^)    #
Prophecy,
and said he thought the Persecution was already begun, and would be  #
sharp,
tho' he hoped it would be short, and he wished himself beyond Sea till
the Troubles were over, and your Lordship wished your self so too?
   [$E. of (^Clare.^) $] No, I said in compliance with his Lordship, #
since he
wished himself beyond Sea, till the Troubles were over, I wished he  #
were 
there too.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] But I perceive all these discourses concerning #
the Government
are reckoned but jests and matter of Laughter, but 'tis a very rank  #
way of
jesting I assure you.
<P 29>
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord, We call our Witnesses seriously,  #
they are the Kings
Council that jest.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Was this before my Lord (^Howard^) was    #
taken?
   [$E. of (^Clare.^) $] Yes, but after Mr. (^Sidney^) was taken.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Well, who do you call next?
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord (^Paget^) , Pray what have you     #
heard my Lord (^Howard^) say
concerning the Plot, and when?
   [$L. (^Paget.^) $] My Lord sits there, and I believe he may       #
remember it was about the
7th of (^July^) , the (^Saturday^) before my Lord went into the      #
Country, to the best of
my memory, which was, I take it, the 9th of (^July^) . Upon          #
(^Saturday^) the 7th at
Night my Lord came to see me, I told him I was glad to see him       #
abroad, and not
concerned in the Disorders that were then so general; My Lord told   #
me he had
been wished joy by several, and he took it ill, because it looked as #
if he were guilty.
'Tis true, my Lord was a man of great finess and readiness in        #
discourse, and came
easily into all Company, my Lord said that was true, but he had so   #
carefully
behaved himself, that he was sure they could not touch him with any  #
thing, nor did he
know any thing of any body else that he could charge them withal.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] When was this my Lord? [$L. (^Paget.^) $]  #
This was the 7th of (^July^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray good my Lord, Why did you joy my     #
Lord (^Howard^) , had
you any reason to mistrust my Lord?
   [$L. (^Paget.^) $] No other reason, then because I knew he was a  #
man of great freedom
in discourse, and might be concerned upon that account.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] And he would frequently discourse against #
the Government I
suppose?
   [$L. (^Paget.^) $] No, I never heard my Lord discourse against    #
the Government in my life.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Sware Dr. (^Burnet^) [$ (which was         #
done) $] Pray will you Doctor acquaint
the Court, what you heard my Lord (^Howard^) say concerning the late #
Plot, and when?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] My Lord (^Howard^) came to see me the day    #
after the discourse of the
Plot broke out, (^Thursday^) I think it was, on (^Wednesday^) it     #
began to be talked of.
The thing was little understood then, but in general a Plot was      #
discovered, and my
Lord with a great many Protestations, lifting up his hands and eyes  #
to Heaven, 
protested he knew of none, and believed there was none, and spake of #
the whole
thing as a Contrivance.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] This was the day after the Discovery broke #
out?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] Yes, the day after that I first heard of it.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Had you any other discourse with my Lord   #
about it?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] I had not seen my Lord before of some        #
Months. And then he spake
a great deal to me. He told me he had been in (^Essex^) , and after  #
that he went to the
(^Bath^) , and went so early and came away before the Company came,  #
because he would
avoid all danger. And he expressed great apprehensions of fear of    #
Sham-Plots,
and spake of False Witnesses and former designs of that Nature. The  #
truth of it
was, one had possessed me much with a belief of the thing, it being  #
then but a
secret, but he strove to dispossess me of that belief, and his whole #
discourse ran
upon that for an whole hour, and expressed, as I said, great fear of #
some 
Sham-Contrivance, and spake much of false Witnesses, wishing that he #
were beyond Sea.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What, he spake as if there were like to be     #
great heats and stirs, I suppose?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] No, the talk was about the Discovery, which  #
he said he believed
was a Contrivance.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Did my Lord (^Howard^) use to come to you  #
some times?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] Yes, he used to come frequently to see me.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Dr. (^Burnet^) , Pray let me ask you one  #
Question, you spake of
solemn Declarations and Protestations made by my Lord (^Howard^) ,   #
what gave the
occasion to such a Solemnity?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] I will tell you the occasion truly, tho it   #
was never asked me before.
It was thus, I being possessed with the belief of the thing by one   #
that assured me
it was true, and would soon appear to be so, I argued upon that      #
belief to convince
my Lord (^Howard^) , that it was true, and he argued a great deal to #
dispossess me of
that belief. And I said, if there be any such thing I pray God       #
forgive them that
are concerned, but certainly it is one of the monstrousest ill       #
things that ever was
<P 30>
done; for hereby they have done all that could be done to ruine the  #
Protestant
Religion. He was smoaking a Pipe of (^Tobacco^) , and he laid down   #
his Pipe, and lifted up
his hands and eyes to Heaven, and protested to me, he neither knew   #
of any such
thing, nor believed it, but it was all a Contrivance.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] By his discourse, you possibly might      #
understand what he meant,
did he mean being privy to the Murder of the King or the raising of  #
Rebellion?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] There was not a word then of the             #
Assassination, but it was all of the
Plot in general. [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did he make no distinction?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] We talked of nothing but Plot in general.    #
For the particulars were
not then known. It was only about the general notion of a Plot.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray what was the reason you had to       #
believe it?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] There was a Gentleman from (^Whitehall^)     #
that came to see me, and he
did assure me it was true, as being one that had it from a           #
Privy-Councellor. This
was on the (^Wednesday^) when the Council sate long about it; and    #
nothing of
particulars was then let out, but only a discourse in general of     #
such a thing, and he said it
would be found to be a certain truth.
    [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] But Doctor did not you a little wonder   #
at the carriage of my
Lord (^Howard^) ? That a man that was not accused, that you heard    #
of, should make such
solemn Protestations?
    [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] My Lord, he said just in this manner as I   #
have told you, when I said,
(^Pray God forgive them if any have been concerned in such a         #        
thing^) , he laid down his Pipe,
and lift up his hands and eyes. Whether he thought I suspected him   #
or no, I can't
tell, he best knows his own thoughts.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did he say a word of Mr. (^Hambden^) ?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] No, there was not any particular person named.
   [$ (^Mr. Recorder.^) $] Doctor, he would not make you his         #
Confessor.
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] His whole hours discourse was to dispossess  #
me of the opinion and
belief I had entertained of the Plot.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Holloway.^) $] This was about (^July^) you say?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] I cannot remember the very day of the Month, #
I believe it was the
latter end of (^June^) , but I am sure it was before any body was    #
Committed, that we
heard of.
   [$ (^Mr. Recorder.^) $] Dr. (^Burnet^) , you say you did believe  #
there was a Plot then?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] Yes, I did so, and he laboured to dispossess #
me of that belief.
   [$ (^Mr. Recorder.^) $] Pray do you believe it now?
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] What a question is that, Mr (^Serjeant^) ?
   [$Dr. (^Burnet.^) $] I make no doubt of it, Sir, as to the        #
Assassination.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord (^Newport^) , Why do you lift up  #
your hands? you don't
do well; for it is a very proper question.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Well call your next Witness Gentlemen?
   [$Mr. (^Thompson.^) $] Swear Mr. (^Gisborne^) [$ (which was       #
done) $]
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Pray Sir, will you acquaint the Court and  #
the Jury what you have
heard my Lord (^Howard^) say about the late Conspiracy?
   [$Mr. (^Gisborne.^) $] My Lord only said he knew nothing of the   #
Plot; that is all I can
say. [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] When was this?
   [$Mr. (^Gisborne.^) $] The (^Saturday^) before he was taken into  #
Custody; then it was that
your honour did say so, my Lord.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Ay, and 100 more I believe would say so,  #
that might be
concerned in it for all that.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Swear Mr. (^Blake^) [$ (which was done) $] #
Pray acquaint my Lord
and the Jury, what discourse you had with my Lord (^Howard^) about   #
his Pardon, and
what he said to you?
   [$Mr. (^Blake.^) $] My Lord, About the Month of (^October^) last  #
my Lord (^Howard^) sent to
me to know how I did, and desired me to come and make him a Visit.   #
The next
day I went and waited upon my Lord at his Lodging at                 #
(^White-hall^) , and after the
Complements passed, my Lord began a discourse of the Plot, and I     #
told him,
That I heard none of the Witnesses had their Pardons, but only       #
(^Keiling^) the first
discoverer. My Lord told me no, but he had a Warrant for his Pardon, #
and with
that he plucked it out and shewed it me, and I read it. And then I   #
told him I
<P 31>
thought it was of no avail without he had his Pardon actually under  #
Seal. He said
no, but he had their word and honour; But, said he, when I first     # 
received the
Warrant, they said I should not meddle in it till I heard from them  #
again, which I
have not yet, and I ascribe it to no other reason but only this,     #
That I must not
have it till the drudgery of swearing is over.                       #
[$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] When was this?
   [$Mr. (^Blake.^) $] In (^October^) last some time. So I then took 
my leave of my Lord;
and my Lord desired me to come and see him at Night about 6 a Clock  #
in the
Evening, for he had a great many came to him, but then he should be  #
at leisure, and
had many things to say to me.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] At that time did my Lord express himself  #
as discontented, and that
it was irksome to him to be brought as a Witness?
   [$Mr. (^Blake.^) $] He only said those words that I have told     #
you, and looked up and
turned up his eyes towards Heaven when he said so.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Pray where is Mr. (^Benjamin Mercer^) ?    #
sware him. [$ (who was sworn) $]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What do you ask him?
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] We bring him to prove that my Lord         #
(^Anglesey^) was served with a
(^ (\Subpoena\) ^) , but is so ill of the Gout he can't come.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] If that be all, there is no question of it,    #
but that he was (\Subpoened\) .
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] If your Lordship please, We will prove in  #
what condition my
Lord (^Anglesey^) is, and then we hope your Lordship will give us    #
leave to prove what
my Lord has said concerning my Lord (^Howard's^) discourses with him.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] No certainly, Mr. (^Williams^) , and I am sure #
you ask it not as expecting
it should be granted.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] I lay it before your Lordship and the Court.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Ay, you lay it before us, but you are a        #
Lawyer, do you your self think
fit it should be done? [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord, I must submit #
it to you.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Come, will you consent, that what the Duke of  #
(^Monmouth^) has said,
shall be given in Evidence, and then I presume the King's Council    #
will consent to your
request.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] I consent? Here is my Clyent, My Lord, in  #
Court, I can
consent to nothing.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] But if so be there be leave given on one side  #
to tell what another
person has said, why should not it be consented to on the other      #
side, that it be proved
what a 3d person that is absent has said for them?
   [$ (^Mr. Recorder.^) $] Ay, will you consent that we prove what   #
the Duke of (^Monmouth^)
has said? [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] We don't know what the Duke of      #
(^Monmouth^) has said.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] But you do know 'tis not Evidence, nor fit to  #
be granted what you ask.
   [$Mr. (^Jones.^) $] You know that 'tis not for your purpose what  #
he has said.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord, We must go according to our       #
Instructions.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] But you know the Law, why should you offer any #
such thing? your
offering it will make the (^Lay (\gens\) ^) that know not the Law,   #
think that the Court put
hardships upon people, in denying things which you that understand   #
the Law know
can't be granted. [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] I do not press it my Lord,  #
but leave it with you.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Why do you spend our time in urging things     #
that are nothing to the
purpose, and cannot be allowed?
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] Now my Lord, We will go on to another part #
of our defence, and
that is, to call Witnesses to the Reputation of Mr. (^Hambden^) ,    #
and his behaviour, to
satisfie you, that he cannot be such a person as the Indictment      #
says, and as he must
be if it be true what this Gentleman my Lord (^Howard^) has sworn.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson.^) $] We will first examine my Lord (^Paget^) .  #
[$ (who stood up) $] 
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord, We ask you to that question. Have #
you known this
Gentleman Mr. (^Hambden^) , and what a sort of a man is he?
   [$Lord (^Paget.^) $] I have good reason to know him. I have known #
him a great while,
and have always believed him an Honest and a Prudent man, a man of   #
Honor and
Vertue and Integrity, my Lord; and I have had no reason to have      #
other Opinion
of him. I know he has been always ever since he came abroad into the #
World a
man that hath loved his Study, and Books and a contemplative life. And
therefore I should not be apt to believe, That he could apply        #
himself to a thing so
contrary to his own nature, and to that way that he delighted in,    #
and had always
<P 32>
hitherto applied himself unto, I mean to ingage in a design of so    #
much Malice and
Wickedness.
   [$Mr. (^Williams.^) $] My Lord, You have had a long Conversation  #
with the knowledge of
Mr. (^Hambden^) , you say. What say you as to his Disposition;       #
Because this
Indictment says he is a Person of a Turbulent, Factious, Seditious   #
Spirit?
   [$Lord (^Paget.^) $] I have always known him a quiet peaceable    #
man, not medling in
Business, very Friendly, free from all Turbulency, not of much       #
acquaintance nor
desirous to make much.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray my Lord (^Paget^) , upon the same    #
Oath you have taken, have
you not at any time heard him express dissatisfaction as to the      #
Male-administration
of the Government? [$Lord (^Pagett.^) $] No, never to me in the least.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Not at the time of the last               #
(^Westminster^) Parliament?
   [$Lord (^Pagett.^) $] No, I never heard him then, nor at any time #
else.
