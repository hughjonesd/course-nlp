   [$ (^Mr. Serjeant Pengelly.^) $] We beg leave that Mr.
(^Eyre^) may be produced and sworn, in order to
prove the Administration of this Oath, and to
prove the Noble Lord's taking it several Times.

[$Mr. (^Thomas Eyre^) Sworn.$]

   [$ (^Mr. Serjeant Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, We desire
that Mr. (^Eyre^) may be asked, Whether he is an
Officer of the Exchequer, and what that Book in 
his Hand is?

   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] My Lords, This Book I have had
in my Custody ever since I have been in the
Office. I have been there forty Years. This is the 
Book in which the Statute of 12 (^Rich.^) 2. is
enter'd; and, before the Privy Council name the
Sheriffs, this Statute is read over to them, and
then the Privy Counsellors are all Sworn.

   [$ (^Mr. Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, We desire the Oath
may be read.

   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] There is no Oath in the Book, 'tis
only the Statute.

   [$ (^Earl of Macclesfield.^) $] Will your Lordships be
pleased that he may speak aloud. He says there
is no Oath in the Book.


   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] The Statute is read, and as soon as
it is read the Book is presented to the Privy
Counsellors, and they are Sworn.

   [$ (^Mr. Serjeant Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, We desire he
may be asked, Whether he was present at any
Time when the Earl of (^Macclesfield^) has taken the
Oath to perform this Statute in the Court of
Exchequer?
<P 24C2>
   [$ (^Mr Eyre.^) $] Yes, several Times.
   [$ (^Earl of Macclesfield.^) $] I beg leave to ask this 
Question in the first Place, Is there any Oath there
in that Book?

   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] No, nothing but the Statute of
(^Rich.^) 2.

   [$ (^Earl of Macclesfield.^) $] Nothing but the Statute
of (^Rich.^) 2. What is it you read, or do at that
Time when you say the Privy Counsellors are
sworn.

   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] As soon as this Statute is read, the
Bible is presented to the Privy Counsellors, and
they kiss the Book.

   [$ (^Earl of Macclesfield.^) $] Is there any one Word said
to them, or by them?

   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] No, the Statute is read over, and
the Privy Counsellors kiss the Book.

   [$ (^Mr. Serjeant Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, We desire he
may read it.

   [$ (^Earl of Macclesfield.^) $] My Lords, I desire that
he may read the very Words in the Book, as he
reads them in the Exchequer.

[$ (Mr. (^Eyre^) reads the Statute.) $]

[^STATUTE OMITTED.^]

   [$ (^Earl of Macclesfield.^) $] Those you say are the
very Words you read at that Time when the
Sheriffs are nominated in the Court of
Exchequer?

   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] Yes.

   [$ (^Earl of Macclesfield.^) $] I suppose you read in that
very Manner.

   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] Yes.

   [$ (^Earl of Macclesfield.^) $] Do you say any one
Syllable more?

   [$ (^Mr. Eyre.^) $] No. 
<P 25C1>
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] In the next place, I desire he
may tell your Lordships what it is that the
Officer does at this time?
   [$Mr. (^Eyre.^) $] He carries the Book to all the Privy
Counsellors, and they kiss it.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] Does he not carry it to the
Judges too?
   [$Mr. (^Eyre.^) $] Yes, every one present kisses the
Book. 
   [$Earl of (^Macclesfield.^) $] Does he say any thing to 
them?
   [$Mr. (^Eyre.^) $] No.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] You say he doth not say any
thing to them?
   [$Mr. (^Eyre^) $] No, nothing at all.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we desire that
Mr. (^Eyre^) may be asked, whether, during his time,
this hath not been the usual Method of 
Swearing the Lords of the Privy Council?
   [$Mr. (^Eyre.^) $] Yes, my Lords, it has.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, it seems to be a
Question whether this is Swearing at all. 
Therefore the Question I desire may be ask'd this
Witness, is, what Book it is they kiss?
   [$Mr. (^Eyre.^) $] My Lords, it is the Bible.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] I desire he may be asked, 
whether this hath not been taken to be Swearing them
to do what is commanded by this Statute?
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] My Lords, we beg Leave to
object to that Question. We apprehend the
Witness is only called to give Evidence as to the Fact,
and not to state his Reasons and Constructions of
Fact.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, I beg Leave then to
ask a Question that I hope they won't object to:
Whether or no this is not the Manner of
Swearing the Lords, upon the Nomination of Sheriffs
in the Court of Exchequer?
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] My Lords, we humbly beg
Leave to object to that Question: We apprehend 
That Centers in the same thing with the former.
The Witness has already given your Lordships
an Account of all that is said and all that is done
when this Act of Parliament is produced. He
tells your Lordships the Act of Parliament is read;
they kiss the Book; nothing is asked of them,
nor is any thing answered: And yet the 
Gentleman is pleased to ask, whether this is called a
Swearing? The Witness has given his Evidence,
your Lordships will determine whether it be a 
Swearing or no.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may be
asked, whether this Kissing the Bible upon the
reading this Act, is not usually done at the time
of appointing the Sheriffs?
   [$Mr. (^Eyre.^) $] As soon as ever the Act is read
over, the Privy-Counsellors kiss the Bible.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, I desire it may
be asked, whether they proceed to name or
appoint any Sheriffs before they kiss the Book in
this manner.
   [$Mr. (^Eyre.^) $] No, they do not.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we shall rest
this matter here.
   [$Lord (^Lechmere.^) $] My Lords, I would be glad if
this Question might be asked the Witness; 
Whether there is any Entry or Memorandum made
upon Record in the Court of Exchequer, of any
Oath taken by the Privy-Counsellors on this
Occasion?
   [$Mr. (^Eyre.^) $] No, there is not.
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $] We submitt this Matter to your
Lordships: This Statute prescribes, that an Oath
shall be particularly taken; the Fact has been 
<P 25C2>
stated by the Witness: And whether it does not
amount to the Proof of an Oath, that they will
comply with that Act of Parliament, we leave to 
your Lordships Judgment.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] We shall leave this
Evidence to your Lordships, and submit it to your
Determination, whether this noble Earl can
excuse himself from his Obligation to this Act of
Parliament, as an Oath? It is very probable,
by his future Conduct, he might be of Opinion,
that there was no Obligation of any Act or Oath
upon him: But upon the Evidence given, we
shall submit this Fact: And shall next proceed
to call some Witnesses to give an Account of the
Nature of the Offices of the Masters in Chancery,
who are admitted, by the noble Lord, within the
Bar. We shall first produce the Oath which is 
administred to every Master in Chancery upon his
Admission: Then we shall shew the Commissions
from (^Edw.^) the VIth's time, and so from time to
time, to this Day; wherein the Masters in
Chancery are joined with my Lords the Judges, to
hear and determine Causes in the Absence of my
Lord Chancellor; to punish Contempts, to
execute and administer a Jurisdiction in that Court.
The particular Oath very little varies from the
Oath administred to the Lord Chancellor, which,
in his Lordship's Answer, is set out at large.
However we shall now beg Leave to produce the
Oath; and to that Purpose, we desire Mr.
(^Pynsent^) , the Deputy-Clerk of the Crown in Chancery,
may be examined, and he will produce the Oath 
before your Lordships.

[$Mr. (^Pynsent^) sworn.$]
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Sir, will you produce,
before the Lords, the Oath administred to the
Masters in Chancery, upon their Admission to their
Offices?
   [$Mr. (^Common Serjeant.^) $] My Lords, we hope he
shall give an Account, whether he hath seen the
Oath taken, and hath administred it?
   [$Mr. (^Pynsent.^) $] Yes, my Lords, I have seen the
Oath taken, and have administred it myself. 

[$Reads the Oath.$]
[^OATH OMITTED.^]
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, there will be
Directions given to lay a Copy of this Oath, as well
as Copies of other Records, upon your Lordships
Table.
    The next Evidence we shall produce, are
Commissions beginning in the Time of (^Edw. 6.^) to this
time, granted to Masters, appointing them to
hear Causes, (^&c.^) The first Commission we shall 
<P 26C1>
produce, is dated the 9th of (^October^) , the 4th of
(^Edw. 6.^) My Lords, we desire that Mr. (^Paxton^)
may be sworn, who has Copies of these 
Commissions, and has examined them with the
Records.
[$Mr. (^Ralph Paxton^) sworn.$]
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we desire that
he may be asked, whether the Copies in his hand
are true Copies, and where they were examined?
   [$Ld. Ch. Just. (^King.^) $] Are they true Copies, and
where did you examine them?
   [$Mr. (^R. Paxton.^) $] My Lords, they are true
Copies. I examined them in several Places. I must
look upon each of them, and then I shall tell your
Lordships where I examined them. I examined
some at the Rolls, some at the Petty-Bag Office,
and some at the Report-Office.
   [$Ld. Ch. Just. (^King.^) $] Did you examine them all
there?
   [$Mr. (^R. Paxton.^) $] I did.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Are they true Copies?
   [$Mr. (^R. Paxton.^) $] I believe they are, I took a
great deal of Care and Pains in examining of 
them.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we desire that
these Copies may be read.
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] Are they upon Stamps?
   [$Mr. (^R. Paxton.^) $] Yes, Sir, with a double
Six-penny Stamp.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, it seems they
are Stampt, since they make an Objection of that
Nature, we desire they may be read.

[$Clerk reads.$]

[^READING OF TEXT IN LATIN OMITTED.^]
<P 26C2>
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly^) .$] We have several others of
the same Nature, which we have proved, and shall
not trouble your Lordships to read them. We
shall beg Leave to lay them on your Lordships
Table. We shall now desire to read some later
Commissions; some granted when the noble Lord
within the Bar had the Custody of the Seal
himself.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] If your Lordships please,
the Date of that may be read.

[$ (^Clerk reads.^) $]
[^READING OF TEXT IN LATIN OMITTED. SHORT SPEECH OF PENGELLY AND 
THE READING OF A THIRD LATIN TEXT ALSO OMITTED.^]
<P 28C2>
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we don't
apprehend it necessary to read all the others over;
we shall deliver them in; unless it be desired by
the noble Lord. My Lords, we now beg leave
to call Mr. (^Meller^) , who hath executed the Office
of a Master in Chancery for several Years. He
will give your Lordships some Account of the
Nature and of the Manner of Execution of that
Office, in support of what the Commons have 
charged.
[$Mr. (^John Meller^) sworn.$]

   [$ (Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, We desire Mr.
(^Meller^) may be asked whether he hath executed
the Office of a Master in Chancery, and how long,
and what is the Nature of that Office?
   [$Ld. Ch. Just. (^King.^) $] Sir, you hear the
Question?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] My Lords, according to the best
of my Remembrance, I was admitted a Master
the latter End of the Year 1708, and continued
so till (^July^) , 1720. The general Nature of the
Office is, to digest and sum up those Matters
which are ordered upon Hearing to be referred
to us, by way of Report: That is the general
Business. There is a further Business, when Bills
of Costs are to be taxed, they are taxed and 
adjusted by us what is to be paid. I don't
recollect any more particular Business.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] I desire he may be asked, for
whose Service and Use those Reports are made?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] Those Reports are made for the
Use of the Suitors of the Court. 'Tis to state
the Facts that the Lord Chancellor has referred
to the Master that are too tedious for the Court
to look into.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] To whom are they returned
and directed?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] These Reports are made to the
Court, to the Lord Chancellor, or the Master 
of the Rolls. They have these Reports, and
make a final Order upon them.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] I desire he may be asked,
when Reports of the several Matters referred to
the Master to consider of, which would take up
too much Time of the Court to settle, are made,
whether those Reports of the Master are at all
conclusive? Or what is the Method in case the
Parties don't acquiesce?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] My Lords, the Report is only to
state the Facts to the Court; and till the Report
is confirmed by the Court, what the Master hath
reported has no Effect. So that I apprehend it is
only to lay the State of the Matter before the
Court: If what the Master reports, seems
agreeable to the Court, then they confirm it; if not,
they vary it, or sometimes send it back again to
the Master for his further Consideration.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serjeant.^) $] My Lords, I desire that
Mr. (^Meller^) may inform your Lordships, if any
Person apprehends the Facts mistaken, whether
they have not an Opportunity of rectifying this
Report of the Master.
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] My Lords, so far as I apprehend,
the Rule of the Court is this, when a Report is
drawn up, the Parties on both Sides have Liberty
to object to that Report before the Master; and
whatever they put in by way of Objection before
the Master, they may speak to those several Points
when the Report comes before the Court.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn^) $] What are the Matters that
are generally referred to the Masters by the
Court?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] The Chief Matters are the stating
of Accompts.
<P 29C1>
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] My Lords, I beg leave to ask
the Witness this Question. Whether any Matters 
of Judgment are at any time referred by the
Court to the Master?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] The Nature of Reports requires
some Conclusion upon them, to be given by the
Masters according to the best of their Opinion.
But the Court gives a Sanction to those Reports.
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] Whether in any one Instance,
the Judgment of the Master is final to the
Suitor?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] I will recollect, and give your
Lordships the best Account that I can remember
as to that. I think when a Master has taxed a 
Bill of Costs, there is a Subpoena taken out for
the Costs upon the Master's Report, without
going to the Court. I am not sure.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serjeant.^) $] When Exceptions are taken
to a Master's Report, doth the Master or the
Court pass a Judgment upon them?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] The Method is this, when a 
Report is drawn up, a Copy is given to both Sides,
and each Side puts in such Objections to it as
they think proper; the Master goes through those
Objections, and having gone through them, he
forms an Opinion upon the whole. Then it goes
to the Court, and the Parties have Liberty to go
upon those Objections before the Court, who
finally determine.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] I desire, my Lords, that Mr.
(^Meller^) may acquaint your Lordships who
presided in the Court when he came in?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] My Lord (^Cowper^) , I take it, was
then Chancellor; it was in the Year 1708, or
the Beginning of 1709.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] We desire to know, whether he
gave any Money when he came into the Office,
and to whom?
   [$Mr. (^Plummer^) $] We have called this Gentleman
to give an Account of the Nature of the Office
of a Master in Chancery, we are not come to that
Matter of giving of Money; we submit whether
it is necessary to enter into that Question now?
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] If this Gentleman is to be
called again, we beg Leave to reserve that
Question till they come to that Part of the Charge.
   [$Mr. (^Plummer.^) $] My Lords, I have another
Question to ask: It has been asked, whether the
Determination of a Master in Chancery is final? I
desire it may be asked, if the Master in Chancery
makes a Report, to which there is no Exception,
whether the Decree in Chancery is not according
to that Report?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] I take it, after the Master has
made a Report, and there is no Exception to it,
that Report is first confirmed (^ (\nisi\) ^) , and then it is
confirmed absolutely upon a second Motion.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may be
asked another Question: If there be a Reference
concerning an Answer which is alledged 
insufficent, and the Master reports it insufficient,
whether it is not final and conclusive, unless the
Party takes Exception to such Report?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] Unless the Party takes Exception,
'tis looked upon as final: For then he submits
and puts in a farther Answer, and then the End
of referring it to the Master is answered: But
the Party may except if he pleases.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] As to the taxing of Costs, 
<P 29C2>
whether when the Costs are taxed to a particular
Sum, that is not final and conclusive, unless the
Party makes Application to the Court?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] I apprehend I did answer that
before. The Master, after he has taxed the Bill of
Costs, the Clerk in Court, as I take it, makes
out Subpoenas for Costs of course: But I cannot
speak to that so well as the Clerks in Court; but
I take that to be the Practice.
   [$Earl of (^Abingdon.^) $] I would be glad to be 
informed in this Point: Supposing a Sum of
Money to be laid out upon a Purchase or Mortgage,
whether the Titles of those Estates are not
commonly referred to a Master, and whether the
Master does not judge of or determine those
Titles?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] In that Case, I can only speak to
what came before myself. When there was an
Order to put Money out upon a Mortgage, the
first Step I took was, I sent the Title-Deeds to
some able Counsel; when I had his Opinion, I
used the best of my Judgment to inform 
myself: If I found no Objection, then I thought
I was obliged to allow the Security, and
accordingly made my Report of Allowance; and then
as Master set my Hand to the Side of the Deed.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] Another Question I would beg
Leave to ask. Tho' it is well known, yet it is fit
it should appear from the Witness, and that is,
Whether the Masters don't sit upon the Bench
with my Lord Chancellor in open Court in
(^Westminster-Hall^) every Term?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] My Lords, in (^Westminster-Hall^)
three Masters are required to attend the
Chancellor; at his own House two; and the like at
the (^Rolls^) .
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] If the Gentlemen have done,
we beg Leave to ask one Question: Whether even
in the Case of Costs, if the Parties are 
dissatisfied, Application is not made to the Court (tho'
not by way of Exception, yet by Motion) to
refer it back again?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] In the Case of Costs, it hath been
a very rare thing to apply to the Court. Some
Instances there have been, I believe, but few.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] I beg Leave the Master would
inform your Lordships, whether in the Case of
Titles, if there happens any Difference in the
Opinion of the Parties, whether they apply to
the Court, or are concluded by the Opinion of
the Master?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] I never knew, during the Time
that I was in the Office, that any Title was ever
contested before the Court; I mean in my own
Case.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] Whether or no he knows any
Case where the Parties have differ'd in Opinion
about a Title, that the Master's Opinion has
concluded the Parties?
   [$Mr. (^Meller,^) $] I don't know, while I was in the
Office, that there was ever any Objection before
me in the Case of a Title.
   [$Mr. (^Robins.^) $] Give me Leave to ask one 
Question: You say three Masters sit with my Lord
Chancellor at (^Westminster^) , two at his own House:
I desire to know what they do there, whether
they sit as Assistants?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] My Lords, I don't know that ever
their Advice was asked.
<P 30C1>
   [$Dr. (^Sayer.^) $] My Lords, I would ask whether
they ever interposed by way of Judgment, or
took upon them to act as Judges?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] My Lords, I think not, I don't
remember any Instance of it.
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may be
asked, whether what the Master ever does is
confirmed of course, or is there not a Motion
for that purpose?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] I thought I mentioned that
before: I shall repeat it again. There is first a
Motion to confirm (^ (\nisi Causa\) ^) ; and upon the
second Motion, unless there is Cause shewn, it is
confirmed.
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may be
asked, if there is not an Affidavit of Service of
the first Order?
   [$Mr. (^Meller.^) $] I believe there is; but that is the
Business of the Sollicitor.
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] My Lords, I beg Leave he may
be asked one Question more, Whether there is
not a Certificate also from the Register that no
Cause is shewn?
   [$Mr (^Meller.^) $] My Lords, I can't speak
particularly as to that; It is a Business that does not
lie before the Master in his Office: I believe in
many Cases the Register certifies.
   [$Dr. (^Sayer.^) $] We will trouble your Lordships
with no more Questions except this one; that is,
Whether we shall see Mr. (^Meller^) again? For if 
we are to take our Leave of him now, we
should offer some other Questions before he
departs.

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 34C1>
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may
be asked, whether he paid the One hundred
Guineas to Mr. (^Cottingham^) , and in what manner?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I did pay it, I think it was in
a Bank Bill of 105 (^l.^)
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Do you remember at what
time?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] It was long before the 
Resignation: For some considerable time after, Mr.
(^Cottingham^) asked me what I meant that I did not
pass the Patent, for the Warrant was come over.
I said I had employ'd Mr. (^Tench^) to do it; but
however I would speak to him again; which
accordingly I did, and Mr. (^Tench^) passed the Patent,
and I paid him 64 (^l.^) 17 (^s.^) 0 (^d.^) the Fees for passing
the Patent.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Was that over and above
the One hundred Guineas?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] Yes, my Lords.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Was there any Deduction
upon the Payment of the One hundred 
Guineas?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] None at all.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may be
asked, how long this was after he was admitted a
Master in Chancery?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I believe it was about six
Weeks. I was admitted a Master in Chancery
the Beginning of (^June^) , and the latter End of
(^July^) following, I surrender'd my Office of Clerk of
the Custodies.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] We have done with Mr.
(^Bennet^) .
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] If the Gentlemen have done
<P 34C2>
with him, we beg that he may be asked a few
Questions on behalf of my Lord (^Macclesfield^) .
What was it you desired Mr. (^Cottingham^) to say in
your Favour to my Lord (^Macclesfield^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I desired Mr. (^Cottingham^) to
acquaint my Lord Chancellor, that I intended to
apply myself to the Secretary of State for Leave
to surrender the Place of Clerk of the Custodies,
and to beg the Favour, that if the Secretary of
State should enquire of him after the Abilities
and Circumstances of Mr. (^Hamersley^) , he might
assure the Secretary of State, that he was a Man
qualified for the Place, and well affected to the
Government.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] Was that all?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I think that was all.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] Was that all that Mr.
(^Cottingham^) told you he had asked?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I don't remember any thing
more, but only Mr. (^Cottingham^) returned for
Answer, my Lord did not know Mr. (^Hamersley^) ,  and
I must make a Present, and then what I desired
would be complied with.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] I think you say you had
some Treaty with Mr. (^Hamersley^) about the
Surrender of your Office?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] Had you come to any 
Agreement with him for the Office, if you could
procure a Surrender and Admittance?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] Then I desire to know what
Sum of Money he was to pay you for that Office,
if you could procure him to be recommended?
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] We hope the Counsel will
not ask such a Question.
   [$Mr. (^Sol. Gen.^) $] It is not so proper for us to
object: The Objection is to come from him: We
may tell him that he is not bound to answer such
a Question, unless he pleases.
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I desire to be excused 
answering a Question that is not material on one
Side or the other.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] I hope it will be thought
reasonable, that he should inform your Lordships,
what was the Consideration that induced him to
surrender his Office, or what Money he was to
have?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I might have surrendered
that Office without receiving any Money for it;
whether I gave it, or whether I sold it away, is not
material.
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] I desire to know whether he gave
it away.
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $] The Question is only to induce him
to accuse himself of a Fact which may be
prejudicial to him, and it hath no Influence on the
Question before your Lordships; which is not,
whether this Gentleman had a Right to give away
or sell his Office, but whether the Earl of 
(^Macclesfield^) corruptly took Money.
   [$Mr. (^Sol. Gen.^) $] It is our Duty that he should
not be surprized into a Question that may subject
him to Punishment: It is not properly an 
Objection from us; but we ought to let him know,
that an Answer to the Question may subject him
to a Prosecution. If he thinks fit to answer, we
have nothing to say to it.
   [$Mr. (^Plummer.^) $] I have another Objection to the
putting of this Question. I perceive the Counsel
intend to draw out this Tryal to an excessive
Length; I hope your Lordships, for your own
<P 35C1>
Sakes, will not permit this Question to be
answered?
   [$Earl of (^Abingdon.^) $] If this Point be insisted on
on both Sides, it cannot be avoided but they must
withdraw: But I hope the Counsel for the noble
Lord will consider very well of it, before they
give your Lordships or the Managers that
Trouble: For if your Lordships should judge the
Question unreasonable, it would throw a Disgrace
upon themselves, and be at least of no Service to the
noble Lord that is impeached.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] I humbly apprehend this
Question to be extremely material, as that
Circumstance of his having made this Present of One
hundred Guineas out of Two thousand, perhaps,
which he received for surrendring the Place, must
set this matter in a different Light than it would
appear in, if nothing else had been done but the
bare paying of the One hundred Guineas; but since
I perceive it to be your Lordships Sense that he
should not be asked the Question, I therefore
decline insisting on it.
   [$Dr. (^Sayer.^) $] My Lords, I beg Leave to ask
Mr. (^Bennet^) this Question: He was pleased to say
that he gave a Hundred Guineas. Now I desire
it may be asked of him, Whether he gave it to
permit him to resign, or to give a 
Recommendation of Mr. (^Hamersley^) , or what else. That he
would please to explain it, what it was given
for. 
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet^) $] I have said it twice; but I
will repeat it again. I said that it was that my
Lord Chancellor might recommend the Person
to the Secretary of State; for I apprehended it
was not in my Lord's Power or Gift: He might
have done it without taking any Money.
   [$Dr. (^Sayer.^) $] With regard to this 64 (^l.^) odd
Money, what was that paid for? Whether to the
Great Seal only, or for the whole Fees in
passing the Patent through all the Offices?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] It was paid to Mr. (^Tench^)
the Clerk of the Patents, who passed this Patent
through all the Offices; and the Great Seal was
included in it as I apprehend.
   [$Dr. (^Sayer.^) $] I ask who this Mr (^Tench^) is,
whether he is an Officer belonging to the Great
Seal, under the Lord Chancellor?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] He is Clerk of the Patents;
I do not know who he belongs to.
   [$Mr. (^Robins.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may be 
asked, Whether Mr. (^Cottingham^) told him, that
the Lord (^Macclesfield^) insisted upon any 
particular Sum?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] Mr. (^Cottingham^) told me, that
my Lord insisted upon One hundred Guineas;
and I argued the Unreasonableness and
Hardship of it.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] My Lords, I desire Mr.
(^Bennet^) may acquaint your Lordships, whether ever
he made any Application to the noble Lord for
Permission to resign?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I never spoke to my Lord
myself.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] If the Gentlemen have done
with him, we beg Leave to explain this Matter,
and to ask him upon what Account it was that
Mr. (^Cottingham^) from my Lord (^Macclesfield^) said
a Present was expected?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I can't say what was Mr.
(^Cottingham's^) Reason; but he said my Lord 
Chancellor did not know Mr. (^Hamersley^) ; and then
he went on, and said, a Present was expected.
<P 35C2>
I apprehended, Mr. (^Cottingham^) took it, that I
could not do it without my Lord Chancellor's
Consent.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] I desire he may be asked,
Whether the Hundred Guineas was paid for a
Recommendation of Mr. (^Hamersley^) , or that the
Whole of procuring the Warrant for the
Patent was to be done for it?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] Mr. (^Cottingham^) assured me,
I need have no farther Trouble about it, if I
would pay the Hundred Guineas: He would
get the King's Warrant; and I should have no
farther Trouble, but passing the Patent.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may
be asked, whether he depended upon these
Assurances, or whether he made Application to
any body else?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I never made any other
Application; and I told Mr. (^Cottingham^) , if any
Accident happen'd of Death, (^&c.^) before the
Warrant came over, I hoped my Lord Chancellor
would return the Hundred Guineas; and he
said, Surely so.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] I beg Leave to observe,
that the Patent proves that this corrupt Bargain
was executed.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] I desire he may be asked, 
whether Mr. (^Cottingham^) delivered to him the
Sign-Manual, or whether Mr. (^Cottingham^) got the 
Patent passed?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I never saw the
Sign-Manual. He delivered it, as I believe, to Mr. (^Tench^) .
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] Did Mr. (^Cottingham^) give you
Notice when the Sign-Manual came over?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] Yes, he did give me Notice
it was come over, and was very angry I did not
go about it.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] I desire Mr. (^Bennet^) may give
your Lordships an Account what Time it was?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] About the latter End of
(^July^) .
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] I desire he may be asked,
whether he had not made Application to the 
(^Secretary's-Office^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] No, I had not made any
Application at all.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] Did you never make any
Application to any other Person, either before
or after?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I am positive I did not.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] Did you ever say about
that time, that you had made Application to any
other Person?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] No, I don't remember that
I did.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] No; did you never make
Application to any body else?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I never told any body, to
the best of my Knowledge and Belief. I am
very confident I never did.
   [$Mr. Serj (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, if they have
done with this Witness, we beg Leave to call
Mr. (^Cottingham^) , who was an Agent, and paid 
over this Money to my Lord (^Macclesfield^) .
[$Mr. (^Peter Cottingham^) sworn.$]
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we only call
Mr. (^Cottingham^) to acquaint your Lordships when
he paid over these Hundred Guineas to my Lord
(^Macclesfield^) .
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] In (^July^) I think it was.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] How long after you
received it from Mr. (^Tho. Bennet^) ?
<P 36C1>
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] I believe I paid it over that
Day, or the Day after.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] I desire he may be asked,
how long before the Patent was passed?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] I can't tell, because I can't 
certainly say when the Patent passed.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] We desire to ask him,
whether it was that Year when the King was beyond
Sea?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] I think, my Lords, it was;
it was in (^July^) 1723.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] If the Gentlemen of the House
of Commons have done with him, I beg that he
would give your Lordships an Account what
Discourse he had with Mr. (^Bennet^) ?
   [$Ld. Ch. Just. (^King.^) $] You hear the Question?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] Mr. (^Tho. Bennet^) told me he had
agreed with Mr. (^Hamersley^) for the Place of the
Clerk of the Custodies; and that he did not think
it convenient to keep two such considerable 
Places which depended upon his own Life only;
that is, the Master's Place, which he had before
purchased, and this. He told me he had
disposed of this Place to Mr. (^Hamersley^) , in order
to reimburse himself Part of the Money he had
paid to Mr. (^Hiccocks^) for his Master's Place that
he had purchased of him, and for that Reason
he did not care to keep both.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] Did he tell you how much he
had disposed of it for?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] No, he did not.
   [$Mr. (^Com. Serj.^) $] My Lords, I desire Mr.
(^Cottingham^) may be asked what it was Mr. (^Bennet^) desired
him to request of my Lord (^Macclesfield^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] To the best of my 
Remembrance, he said, he hoped that his Lordship would
accept of a Hundred Guineas, because he had
received from him so lately a Present for his
Master's Place; and he desired his Lordship to
forward his Petition to his Majesty.
   [$Dr. (^Sayer.^) $] Was this on the first Application?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] Yes; he never made but one
Application to me.
   [$Dr. (^Sayer.^) $] It is of Consequence; and
therefore I desire it may be asked, whether at the 
first time he apply'd, he made this Offer of One
Hundred Guineas?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] He did, and I paid it over to
my Lord (^Macclesfield^) .
   [$Dr (^Sayer.^) $] I desire Mr (^Cottingham^) may be
asked, whether he knew Mr (^Hamersley^) before this 
time?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] I knew him very well, he was
my next Door Neighbour both in Town and
Country.
   [$Dr (^Sayer.^) $] Did you tell Mr (^Bennet^) you did not
know him?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] No, I never told him so, it
was impossible I should; he was my next Door
Neighbour both in (^Bell-year^) , and at (^Hampstead^) .
   [$Dr (^Sayer.^) $] What Character had Mr (^Hamersley^) ?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] A very good one.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] When you first spoke to me
of this matter, what did you tell me?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] I told your Lordship Mr
(^Hamersley^) was my next Door Neighbour both in
Town and Country; and that he was a 
Gentleman of as unquestionable a Character as any at
the Bar; and your Lordship was pleased to
depend upon me for his Character.
   [$Mr (^Strange.^) $] He is pleased to say Mr (^Bennet^)
did not inform him what Agreement was made
<P 36C2>
between him and Mr (^Hamersley^) . But did not he say
on what Account he resign'd?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] He told me he surrendred the
Office, to reimburse himself the Money he had
paid to Mr. (^Hiccocks^) for his Office.
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] What Office was that?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] The Master's Office.
   [$Mr. (^Strange.^) $] Did he mention that?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] Yes, he did mention it.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] If they have done, we beg
leave to ask Mr. (^Cottingham^) , since he informed my
Lord of the Circumstances of Mr. (^Hamersley^) , 
whether he acquainted my Lord of Mr. (^Hamersley^)
before or after the time he paid the 100 Guineas?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] I acquainted his Lordship
before.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] I beg leave to ask another
Question. If this Gentleman can inform your
Lordships upon what Account it was, he received
the 100 Guineas from Mr. (^Bennet^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] I received the 100 Guineas
upon Account of his Surrender of his Office.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] We beg leave to ask
another Question. Whether before he agreed with
Mr. (^Bennet^) , he had informed my Lord (^Macclesfield^)
of any Proposal, or what was to be expected?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] No, I don't remember I did.
All that passed on that Occasion was, Mr. (^Bennet^)
said he was willing to give 100 Guineas, and he
hoped his Lordship would not insist upon more.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] I beg he may be asked
another Question. Whether when he came back
from my Lord (^Macclesfield^) to Mr. (^Bennet^) , with
the Account of the Acceptance of the 100
Guineas, whether he did not tell Mr. (^Bennet^) he ought
to take it as a favour that his Lordship accepted so
little?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] I can't remember, but I
think I did not.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Can you say you did, or
you did not?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] To the best of my 
Remembrance I did not.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] We desire he may inform
your Lordships what Answer he brought to Mr.
(^Bennet^) from my Lord (^Macclesfield^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] The Answer my Lord
(^Macclesfield^) ordered me to give to Mr. (^Bennet^) , was, that
he agreed to accept of the 100 Guineas according
to his Proposal.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Whether was this Offer of
the 100 Guineas the first time, or after Mr.
(^Cottingham^) had spoken to my Lord (^Macclesfield^) about
it?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] Mr. (^Bennet^) proposed to me to
give the 100 Guineas before I spoke to my Lord
about it.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Whether it was the first
Time he offered the 100 Guineas, or some time
after.
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] He offered the 100 Guineas
the first time.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Whether Mr. (^Cottingham^)
did not say the first time, that something was
expected?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] I believe I did say the Great
Seal would expect something.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] Mr. (^Cottingham^) says he believes
he did say something was expected. Then I
desire to refresh his Memory, and that he would
acquaint your Lordships whether that was
mentioned before the 100 Guineas were offered?
<P 37C1>
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] No, not as I remember.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] What did you say on that
Occasion?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] I said on that Occasion, as
he offered 100 Guineas, I told him my Lord was
willing to accept of it.
   [$mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] I am speaking of the first
Discourse he had with him, I think he does 
recollect that he said my Lord expected something
on the Account of this Office?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] The first Discourse when that
was mentioned, I told him my Lord expected
something to be paid by way of Compliment.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] Was that the first Discourse?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] The first that I remember.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] I beg another Question. If
Mr. (^Cottingham^) told Mr. (^Bennet^) that my Lord
expected something by way of Compliment, how
came Mr. (^Cottingham^) to know that?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] Mr. (^Bennet^) asked me if I
believed his Lordship would not expect a 
Compliment? I told him I believed his Lordship would,
and then he said he would give 100 Guineas.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] Had you any Discourse with
my Lord (^Macclesfield^) before?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] No, none at all. I told him
it was usual to make a Present; and then he told
me he was willing to give 100 Guineas.
   [$Mr. (^Plummer.^) $] I know Mr. (^Cottingham^) is a 
very honest Gentleman. I desire to ask him, if
Mr. (^Bennet^) did not then tell him, that when his
Brother was admitted, my Lord (^Cowper^) would 
take nothing?
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] He did not upon the Oath
I have taken, this is the first Word I heard of
it: I did not know whether his Brother paid any
thing or nothing.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] There is some little
Variation, tho' not material, between Mr. (^Bennet^) and
Mr. (^Cottingham^) ; we beg that Mr. (^Bennet^) may
come to the Bar again.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] My Lords, I don't oppose
Mr. (^Bennet's^) coming to the Bar again; but I think
it is very extraordinary for Persons to produce
Witnesses to confront their own Witnesses.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] We do it, to confirm the
Testimony of our Witness.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] In an Affair of this Nature
it is impossible to produce direct Evidence, 
without producing the Agent employed. Mr. 
(^Cottingham^) was the Agent made use of by the
Chancellor, and we beg leave to ask of Mr. (^Bennet^)
what Answer Mr. (^Cottingham^) brought or said he
brought from my Lord Chancellor relating to
this Affair.
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] When Mr (^Cottingham^) went
from me to my Lord Chancellor, there was not
a Word of Money mentioned the first time. I
would not so much as put it into his Head; and
he returned to me the next Day, and told me my
Lord Chancellor insisted upon a Present. Then
I said it was very hard, and I would give my Lord
100 Guineas if it must be so.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Was it not at the second
Meeting that he insisted on a Present to my Lord?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] At the second Meeting. At
the first time he did not, because there was no
mention made of Money.
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] All that Mr (^Bennet^) said to
me on that Occasion was, that in regard a
Compliment of 1500 Guineas had been so lately given
to his Lordship, he hoped his Lordship would
take no more of him than 100 Guineas.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] These Gentlemen are
pleased to differ in their Evidence. I would ask
<P 37C2>
Mr (^Bennet^) a second time, whether Mr (^Cottingham^)
told him that he did not know Mr (^Hamersley^) .
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I am sure Mr. (^Cottingham^)
told me that my Lord Chancellor did not know 
him, and I think he told me that he did not
know him. That made me say, why, Sir, that is 
strange you should not know him, when he lives
the next Door to you!
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] Before, he said Mr.
(^Cottingham^) said he did not know Mr (^Hamersley^) . I think
he told your Lordships so, that he did not know
him.
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] It is impossible to swear to a
Conversation at so great Distance.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] You are not positive?
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I am not positive.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] Then, if he is not positive
whether Mr (^Cottingham^) told him so, I desire he
may be asked whether he is positive that he
answered Mr (^Cottingham^) , why Sir that is very strange
that you should not know him, when he lives the
next Door to you?
   [$Mr (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] I am as positive of the one as
of the other. This Conversation passed between
us, as near as I can remember.
   [$Mr. (^Cottingham.^) $] It is very strange I should say
so of my very next Door Neighbour, and a 
Gentleman at the Bar.
   [$Mr. (^Thomas Bennet.^) $] Therefore I wondered at
it.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] There is but one thing more
relating to this Article. It is very well known
that his Lordship was one of the Lords Justices.
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] It is very strange sure, Mr.
(^Bennet^) , that I should not know him. He is a
Gentleman at the Bar, I see him every Day at
(^Westminster-Hall^) .
   [$Mr. (^Tho. Bennet.^) $] That was the Wonder I made
of it. I might mistake you; I am sure you said
my Lord did not know him, and I believe you
said you did not know him. Mr. (^Cottingham^) is
very deaf, and he might mistake me.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, We apprehend,
the noble Lord does not put us on the Proof of
his Acting as one of the Lords Justices.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] If Mr. (^Delafaye^) is there,
I desire he may be called to give an Account of
my Acting.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] What I call Mr. (^Delafaye^)
for, is to give an Account of my Lords Acting as
one of the Lords Justices. If they don't admit
it; we must call him.
   [$Dr. (^Sayer.^) $] My Lords, we desire he may be
called.
[$Mr. (^Delafaye^) called.$]

   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] We desire Mr. (^Delafaye^)
may be sworn.
[$Mr. (^Delafaye^) sworn.$]

   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Since that is insisted upon
for Form-sake, which is notorious to the whole
Kingdom, we only beg leave to ask Mr. (^Delafaye^) ,
whether my Lord Chancellor acted as one of 
the Lords Justices at the Time of this Patent.
[$ (shewing him (^Mr. Hamersley's^) Patent.) $] Look upon
the Date of that Patent.
   [$Mr. (^Delafay.^) $] Yes, my Lords.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we only ask
this Witness whether my Lord Chancellor, who
had then the Custody of the Great Seal, acted as
one of the Lords Justices?
   [$Mr. (^Delafaye.^) $] Yes, my Lords, he did.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] I beg leave to ask him, 
whether he knew any thing of Mr. (^Bennet's^) Petition
<P 38C1>
being transmitted to his Majesty abroad, and by
whose Direction?
   [$Mr. (^Delafaye.^) $] Mr. (^Bennet's^) Petition was
transmitted to his Majesty abroad, by the Direction of
the Lords Justices.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] I desire this Witness would
inform your Lordships, whether in Mr. (^Bennet's^)
Petition it was desired that a Grant of his Office
should be made to any, and what particular
Person.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] I think we may 
reasonably object to that Question. We are not for
troubling your Lordships with unreasonable 
Objections; but when a Gentleman experienced in
the Law shall ask Questions, concerning written
Evidence, we must oppose that, and submit it to
your Lordships.
   [$Then the Managers for the Commons
acquainting the House, that they had gone through with
their Evidence to the Ninth Article, did intend
next to proceed to the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and
Eighth Articles; and alledging it was requisite
their Evidence should be given entire, submitted
it to their Lordships whether they should now
proceed; whereupon, they and all Parties were
directed to withdraw, and the Lords Resolved to
proceed further in the Tryal tomorrow at Ten of
the Clock in the Forenoon, and adjourned to
Nine a Clock tomorrow Morning.$]

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 38C2>
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] What Arguments were
made Use of by Mr. (^Cottingham^) , to raise the Price
from One Thousand to Fifteen hundred Guineas?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] I don't particularly remember;
but either Mr. (^Rogers^) or Mr. (^Cottingham^) said it
was the oldest and the best Office.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Whether any thing was
said that the Office was full of Cash?
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] We apprehend that a
Leading Question.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] It is a proper Question. But
however, if they do not like it in those Words,
we will put it into another Form. Whether there 
was any Discourse about the Profits of the Office?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] I don't remember it.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] Was there any Discourse about
your being recommended by any one?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] I told him I had the Honour to
be known to the late Lord (^Bradford^) , and desired 
to know whether his Recommendation might be
necessary.
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $] What Reason did they give you
why it was the best Office?
   [$Mr. (^Kynston.^) $] Because it was the Senior Office,
and had most Causes in it.
   [$Sir (^Wm. Strickland.^) $] I desire to know what
Answer Mr. (^Cottingham^) gave him, when he said he
believed he might obtain that noble Lord's 
Recommendation?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] I don't remember any he made.
   [$Mr. (^Plummer.^) $] Whether any Objection was
made by him to the Price upon his coming into
the Office, by reason of any Deficiency in 
(^Dormer's^) Office?
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] That Question is liable to
the same Objection that was made to the former;
it is too leading.
   [$Mr. (^Sol. Gen.^) $] It is a fair Question, whether
any Objection was made by him, on Account of
the Deficiency of (^Dormer's^) Office?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] I mentioned this to Mr. (^Rogers^) ,
he made little of it; I mentioned it afterwards
to Mr. (^Cottingham^) , he too seemed to make light 
of it, and said it would be made up. So that I
apprehended it would be of no great Consequence.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] What Reason did he give,
why he thought his Admission to the Office was
not worth Fifteen Hundred Pounds?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] I don't know that I mentioned
any thing.
<P 39C1>
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] In what manner was the
Money paid?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] I did not count it, but the Sum
of Fifteen Hundred Guineas was carried in a
Bag by Mr. (^Baily^) to Mr. (^Cottingham^) .
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] I desire he may be asked,
whether he had any Discourse with Mr. (^Rogers^)
the former Master, about the Value of this
Office, before he spoke with Mr. (^Cottingham^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] How much did he say it
was worth?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] He said, he usually made 1700 (^l.^)
a Year of the Office, and sometimes 2000 (^l.^) a
Year.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] I desire he may be asked,
what Sum of Money he gave Mr. (^Rogers^) for his
Place?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] 6000 (^l.^)
   [$Dr (^Sayer.^) $] I desire this Gentleman may be
asked, at what time he paid Mr (^Cottingham^) this
Fifteen hundred Guineas; whether it was before or
after his Admission?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] Before; I believe it was the 8th
or 9th of (^August^) in the Morning.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] I desire this further Question,
whether he paid it out of the Suitors Money, or
out of Effects of his own?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] It could not be paid out of the
Suitors Money, for I was not then admitted.
   [$Mr (^Com. Serj.^) $] Whether Mr (^Baily^) , or any body
else, concerned in negotiating this Affair, gave
any Account of your Substance and Ability?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] No, I believe not.
   [$Mr (^Lutwyche.^) $] If the Gentlemen have done, I
beg Leave to ask him one Question, and it is in
relation to what he was examined to first: He
said there was a Discourse, that the Office was
worth 17000 or 2000 (^l.^) a Year. Now, my Lords,
I would ask him, how it was Mr (^Kynaston^) 
apprehended these great annual Profits did arise?
whether by the ordinary Profits of the Office, or
the making Use of the Suitors Money?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] I understood it of both together.
   [$Mr (^Lutwyche.^) $] There hath been one Question
asked, as if there was no Colour to say this
Money was paid out of the Suitors Money: But I
would beg Leave to ask another Question to
explain that: I think Mr (^Kynaston^) says, that the
Money paid for him by Mr (^Baily^) , was not out of
the Suitors Money, because he was not then
admitted; but I would ask, how it was repaid or
replaced?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] I did not imagine, when I came
to Town, that the Place would have come to so
much: There was 1100 (^l.^) and 400 (^l.^) I borrow'd of
a Gentleman, one Mr (^Rogers^) at (^Temple-Bar^) ; and
I afterwards accompted with him for that Money,
for I kept an Account of the Money of the Court
with him.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] What Sum of Money was
reported to be in your Office, and to go along
with the Office as Cash?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] I was told there was about
20,000 (^l.^)
   [$Mr (^Com. Serj.^) $] I desire to know who told him
so?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] Mr (^Rogers^) .
   [$Lord (^Lechmere.^) $] When the 1100 (^l.^) and the
400 (^l.^) was accompted for to the Person that first
lent it, if I did understand him right, he says he
accompted for it, and it was allow'd out of the
Suitors Money.
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] Yes, my Lords, the Money lent
me to pay Mr (^Cottingham^) , I did accompt for that
Money out of the Money belonging to the Suitors
<P 39C2>
of the Court: I understood it was usual to do so,
and that others had done it.
   [$Lord (^Lechmere.^) $] My Lords, I would ask him
another Question; I think Mr. (^Kynaston^) talks of
6000 (^l.^) being paid by him to his Predecessor: I
would be glad to know in what manner that was
paid, and out of what Money or Effects?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] My Lords, when I treated with
Mr (^Rogers^) , he mention'd to me what Money he
had in his Hands belonging to the Office; and we
entred into Articles in relation to my paying him
6000 (^l.^) for his Place: And when I came up to
Town, in order to take the Office, before I went
to my Lord Chancellor's, I gave him a Bond for
6000 (^l.^) This was the 9th, and on the 12th he
deliver'd me up the Bond, and paid me 9 (^l.^) in
Money; and I gave him a Receipt for Six thousand
and nine Pounds.
   [$E. of (^Strafford.^) $] I desire he would explain
himself on that Part; where he says, he gave him up
his Bond; whether he reckoned the 6000 (^l.^) so
much short of the Suitors Money?
   [$Mr. (^Kynaston.^) $] Yes, my Lords, I did.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may
be asked this Question. He speaks of a 
Gentleman that paid him 1100 (^l.^) Part of the 1500
Guineas; I desire he may be asked whether, that
Gentleman had any, and what Money of his in
his Hands?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] My Lords, I had Money in that
Gentleman's Hands: When I lived in the
Country, he used to receive Money for me in Town,
on Government Securities, and other Occasions,
and pay as I directed: There was an Accompt
Current between us, and I did not then precisely
know what Balance was then in his Hands; but
I have cast it up since, and find that there was
about 300 or 400 (^l.^) due to me at that time.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] If I apprehend him right,
he says he had an Accompt current with that
Gentleman at that time, and kept Cash with him.
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] He used to receive and pay
Money for me when I was in the Country.
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] I beg Leave to ask one
Question more, if Mr (^Kynaston^) did not afterwards
keep, with that Gentleman, the Cash of the 
Suitors, as well as his own Cash, promiscuously?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] Yes.
   [$Sir (^Wm. Strickland.^) $] When was the Fifteen
hundred Guineas paid?
   [$Mr (^Kynaston.^) $] On the 8th the Fifteen hundred
Guineas was paid, and the 9th I was admitted.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] We don't now proceed to
examine relating to the manner of Payment for
the Offices out of the Suitors Money, because
there will be a distinct Examination as to that, 
upon another Article; the present Question being
only about the Sum paid for the Admission, and
not out of what Money, which we don't enter
into at present.
   [$Mr (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, we think it
necessary to mention this, because otherwise it will take
up a great deal of your Lordships time 
unnecessarily, and it will be proper to keep the Evidence
entire; and therefore we hope the Counsel on the
other Side shall be confined to ask such Questions
only, as are proper to the Article they are upon.
My Lords, we desire Mr (^Charles Baily^) may be
called.
[$ (^Mr.^) Charles Baily (^sworn^) .$]
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, I desire he may
be asked, whether he paid any Money, and what
Sum to Mr (^Cottingham^) , and when?
   [$Mr. (^Baily.^) $] My Lords, a day or two before
Mr (^Kynaston^) was admitted, I paid Fifteen hundred
<P 40C1>
Guineas, which was given for his Admission. I
delivered it in a Bag to Mr (^Cottingham^) .
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] For what Use was it paid?
   [$Mr (^Baily.^) $] I apprehend it was for the Use of
my Lord Chancellor.
   [$Mr (^Lutwyche.^) $] Upon what Account?
   [$Mr (^Baily.^) $] For his Admission to the Office,
on Mr (^Rogers's^) Surrender.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] I think he says it was paid a
day or two before he was admitted.
   [$Sir (^Wm. Strickland.^) $] Before the Payment of this
Money, what Discourse was there between you
and Mr (^Cottingham^) ?
   [$Mr (^Baily.^) $] I was requested, by Mr (^Kynaston^) , to
attend Mr (^Cottingham^) , to know what was expected;
and Mr (^Cottingham^) told me Fifteen hundred 
Guineas was expected to be paid, as a Sum for Mr
(^Kynaston's^) Admission.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] If the Counsel for the noble
Lord don't ask this Witness any thing, we beg
Leave to call another Witness.
   [$Mr (^Com. Serj.^) $] There are several matters we
apprehend proper to be asked now, and yet may
fall under the other Article. Whether it is your
Lordships Pleasure that we shall now ask Mr (^Baily^)
as to the Circumstances and Character of Mr 
(^Kynaston^) ?
   [$Mr (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, there is an express
Article to that Point; wherefore when we come
to that, then is the time.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] One Question may be proper
to be asked before this Gentleman goes, and that
is, whether when Mr (^Cottingham^) told him what
was expected on his Admission, he told Mr
(^Kynaston^) of it?
   [$Mr (^Baily.^) $] Yes, Sir, I told Mr (^Kynaston^) that
Fifteen hundred Guineas was expected.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] Then I desire he may be
asked, whether Mr (^Kynaston^) did not immediately
consent to give it, or what did Mr (^Kynaston^) say?
   [$Mr (^Baily.^) $] Mr (^Kynaston^) said he must submit to
it, and do as Mr (^Cottingham^) had mention'd, or to
that purpose.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Whether Mr (^Kinaston^)
informed him of offering him any less Sum, and
what?
   [$Mr (^Baily.^) $] Mr (^Kynaston^) mention'd to me that
he thought it had been but 1500 (^l.^)
   [$E. of (^Macclesfield.^) $] How came Mr (^Baily^) to know
it was Guineas?
   [$Mr (^Baily.^) $] Because Mr (^Cottingham^) told me so.
[$Mr (^Cottingham^) called, but did not immediately 
appear.$]
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we are
unwilling to give your Lordships Trouble, only beg
Leave to take Notice, that Mr (^Cottingham^) was
Secretary to the Lord impeach'd, during the whole
Course of his Administration; he is not
immediately under the Power of the Managers, but he
is under the Obligation of a Summons, and had
Noticed to attend.
[$Mr (^Cottingham^) appears.$]
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we desire he may
be sworn.
[$Mr (^Cottingham^) sworn.$] 
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we beg Leave
to ask Mr (^Cottingham^) this Question; the Money
that he received from Mr (^Charles Baily^) , whether he
paid it over to my late Lord Chancellor, and when?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] The Money which I received
from Mr (^Charles Baily^) , the Fifteen hundred 
Guineas, I paid it to my Lord in a day or two I
believe, I believe the next day; it was very soon
after I received it from Mr (^Baily^) .
<P 40C2>
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Whether he acquainted the
Earl of (^Macclesfield^) that he had received it upon
Mr. (^Kynaston's^) Admission?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] Yes, my Lords, I told the Earl
of (^Macclesfield^) that Mr (^Baily^) had paid me the
Money, by the Direction of Mr (^Kynaston^) .
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] How long was that before
Mr (^Kynaston^) was admitted?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] I can't say justly the time, it
might be two or three days. There was a day 
appointed for the Admission of Mr (^Kynaston^) , but
something happened that he could not be
admitted that day.
   [$Sir (^Wm. Strickland.^) $] My Lords, I desire to ask
this Witness one Question: At that time, 
whether Mr (^Cottingham^) can recollect himself, if Mr
(^Kynaston^) did not make an Objection of the great
Deficiency that had happened in (^Dormer's^) Office?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] Upon the Oath that I have
taken, I did not.
   [$Sir (^Wm Strickland.^) $] I desire another Question,
whether he did not tell Mr (^Kynaston^) that this was
one of the best Offices?
   [$Dr (^Sayer.^) $] My Lords, I ask your Pardons; I
hope they shall be confined to the general 
Question what was said, and not to Particulars.
   [$Sir (^Wm. Strickland.^) $] What was said in relation
to the Goodness of the Office?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] I did say before the 
Honourable Committee, that when he agreed to give the
Fifteen hundred Guineas, I told him that he had
purchased a very good Office; and I did say, that
there was a great deal of Business in it; but I
never knew what Money was in the Office, nor do I
know it to this day. I own I did say before the
Honourable Committee, that I told him he had 
purchased a good Office.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Whether was this before or
after the Agreement made with Mr (^Kynaston^) ?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] I think at the same time, just
after we had settled the Compliment to be paid to
my Lord (^Macclesfield^) , I told him he had purchased
an Office with very good Business in it.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] I desire one Question more,
whether he remembers that there was any 
Mention made of 1000 (l.) or One thousand Guineas by
Mr. (^Kynaston^) ?
   [$Mr (^Cottingham.^) $] No, I remember nothing of it.
He asked me what my Lord expected; I told him
what my Lord had from the preceding Masters,
he expected the same from him: I never heard a
Word of 1000 (^l.^) or One thousand Guineas, nor
knew nothing at all of it. I have given you the
best Account I can as to the Fact that happened
relating to the Agreement: Mr (^Baily^) may
remember more of it; the Fact is about for Years
ago.
   [$Mr Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we now beg
Leave to proceed to the 6th Article, relating to
Mr (^Thomas Bennet^) , who was admitted the 1st of
(^June^) , 1723.

<S SAMPLE 4>
<P 44C1>
[$Mr. (^Elde^) called.$]

   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, we desire that
Mr. (^Elde^) may [^SOURCE TEXT: my^] be sworn.

[$ (Sworn accordingly.) $]

   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, we desire Mr.
(^Elde^) may be asked when it was he was 
admitted a Master in Chancery?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] My Lords, I was admitted the
first Day of (^February^) last was twelve Month.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] We desire he may be asked,
whether he applied in Person to my Lord 
(^Macclesfield^) to be admitted into this Office, and
whether it was upon Death or Resignation?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] Upon the Death of Mr. (^William 
Fellowes^) some of my Friends came to me, and
put it into my Head that this Office might
be a proper Office for me, and I took some
Time to consider of it. I had some 
Encouragement at the Bar, and was very unwilling to
quit it, but after two Days Consideration I
went to my Lord himself; I told his 
Lordship an Office was fallen by the Death of Mr.
(^Fellowes^) ; if his Lordship thought me a proper
Person. And I should be glad to have it. I was
come to wait upon him about it. His 
Lordship said, he had no manner of Objection to
<P 44C2>
me, he had known me a considerable Time,
and he believed I should make a good Officer.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] What further Discourse was
there?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] My Lord at that Time desired
me further to consider of it, and come to him
again: And so I did. I went back from his
Lordship, and I came again in a Day or two, I
believe it was the second after I came back
from his Lordship, and told him I had 
considered of it, and desired to know if his Lordship
thought fit to admit me; and I would make
him a Present of 4 or 5000 (^l.^) I cannot say
which of the two I said, but I believe it was
5000 (^l.^)
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] What Answer did my Lord
return, when you made him that Proposal?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] My Lord said, Thee and I, or
You and I, my Lord was pleased to treat me
as a Friend, must not make Bargains.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, we desire he may
be asked, whether my Lord (^Macclesfield^) said in
what Manner he would treat with him, 
whether in a more beneficial manner than any
Body else?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] My Lord (^Macclesfield^) did say, that
if I was desirous of having the Office, he would
treat with me in a different Manner than he
would with any Man living; those were the
Words my Lord used, to the best of my 
Remembrance.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] After this Answer of my
Lord (^Macclesfield^) , that they must not make
Bargains, what further Application did he make?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] I made no further Application at
all, but spoke to Mr. (^Cottingham^) , meeting him
in (^Westminster-hall^) , and told him I had been at
my Lord's, and my Lord was pleased to speak
very kindly to me, and I had proposed to give
him 5000 (^l.^) Mr. (^Cottingham^) answered, Guineas
are handsomer.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] We desire to know what he
paid, and in what Manner, and in what Specie?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] My Lords, I paid my Lord, --
I cannot say I paid it him, but I paid 5000
Guineas.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] In what Manner? Who did
you pay it to?
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] After this Agreement
with Mr. (^Cottingham^) to make it Guineas, as
being handsomer; we desire he may inform your
Lordships what he did pursuant to this, and
what he carried with him?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] Upon this I immediately went to
my Lord's: I was willing to get into the
Office as soon as I could. I did carry with me
5000 Guineas in Gold and Bank Notes: I am
not certain whether there was 3000 Guineas in
Gold or two, but I think there was three, and
the Residue of the Money was in Bank Notes.
This I brought to my Lord's House.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] My Lords, we desire he
may be asked what they were put into, or in
what they were carried?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] I had the Money in my
Chambers. I could not tell how to convey it; It
was a great Burthen and Weight, but
recollecting I had a Basket in my Chamber, I put the
Guineas into the Basket, and the Notes with
them; I went in a Chair and took with me the
Basket in my Chair. When I came to my Lord's
House I saw Mr. (^Cottingham^) there, and I gave
him the Basket, and desired him to carry it
up to my Lord.
<P 45C1>
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] What Answer did he
return?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] I saw him go up Stairs with the
Basket, and when he came down he intimated
to me that he had delivered it.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, we desire he may
be asked whether he acquainted Mr. (^Cottingham^)
with what was in the Basket?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] I did not.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] After Mr. (^Cottingham^) came
and acquainted you he had delivered the
Basket, how long after that was it before you saw 
my Lord?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] I did not see my Lord after that,
till I was sworn in.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] How long was that after?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] I cannot be positive, but it was
within a Day, either the same Day, or if not,
it was the next Day after.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] I desire he may be asked,
when Mr. (^Cottingham^) returned down Stairs 
after the Delivery of the Basket, what he said
to him about the Time of his being admitted?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] I do not remember he said any
Thing to me about my being admitted. I
took that for granted.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] And when he was
admitted, whether he was admitted in the Closet
or in what Room?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] When I was to be admitted, my
Lord invited me to Dinner, and some of my
Friends with me; and he was please to treat
me and some Members of the House of
Commons in a very handsome Manner: I was after
Dinner sworn in before them.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] I desire to ask whether
he had the Basket again?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] Some Months after I spoke to my
Lord's Gentleman, and desired him if he saw
such a Basket, that he would give it me back;
and sometime after he did so.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Pengelly.^) $] Was any Money returned
in it?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] No, my Lords, there was not.
   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] There is one Thing in the
Earl's Answer, that he retained only Part of
the Present so made him by Mr. (^Elde^) . I 
perceive the Gentlemen of the other Side do not
ask any Questions about it; if they do not we
shall go on.
   [$Sir (^Wm. Strickland.^) $] I desire to know what
Mr. (^Cottingham^) did say, after he had carried up
the Basket and came down again?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] To the best of my Remembrance,
he said nothing to me, but as I repeated it
before, he intimated to me that he had
delivered it to my Lord (^Macclesfield^) . I cannot say
as to any particular Discourse; but I 
understood that he had delivered it.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] My Lords, if they have
done with Mr. (^Elde^) , I would beg Leave to
ask him one Question, and that is in Relation
to what the impeached Earl said in his
Answer, that he retained of the Present sent him
by the said Mr. (^Elde^) no more than the Sum of
1850 (^l.^) We desire therefore that he may be
asked, how much was returned to him of the
5000 Guineas which he at first paid?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] 3400.
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $] When was that returned again
to him?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] In (^November^) last, to the best of
my Remembrance.
<P 45C2>
   [$Mr. (^Onslow.^) $] In what Manner was that
Money returned to him?
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] We have not yet done
with him. I desire to know when you went
out of Town, and when you returned, and
how long after your Return was it repaid?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] It was repaid to me, to the best
of my Knowledge, within three, four, or five
Days after my Return. As soon as I came
from the Country the Earl took Notice of it,
and said that he would repay me: For some
Time in (^May^) before, or thereabouts, the
noble Lord had taken Notice that he had
received this Present from me, and he would
make me exceedingly easy.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] This was before you went
out of Town?
   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] Before I went out of Town.

return me my Money again, he did not say all,
but he would return me my Money; and that
he had done it before, had it been convenient.
   [$Mr. Serj. (^Probyn.^) $] How soon after this 
Discourse was it, that the Money was returned?

I desire he may be asked in what Manner this
Money was returned, and by whom?

then at (^Westminster-hall^) , and told me my Lord

   [$Mr. (^Lutwyche.^) $] My Lords, if I understand 
Mr. (^Elde^) right, he said there was some Thing
mentioned by my Lord of this Kindness
before he went into the Country. I desire he may 
be asked upon what Occasion he was going
into the Country at that Time?
   [$Mr. (^Onslow.^) $] I desire that he may first answer
in what Manner, by whom, and where, this
Money was repaid to him, whether in
Money, or Notes, or how?

it was paid in this Manner, there was 1400 (^l.^)
in Bank Notes, and 2000 (^l.^) in (^India^) Bonds.

   [$Mr. (^Elde.^) $] By my Lord (^Parker^) .
