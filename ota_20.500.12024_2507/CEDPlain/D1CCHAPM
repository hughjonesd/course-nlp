   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Good sonne go forward in this gentle humor, 
obserue this picture, it presents a maide of noble birth and 
excellent of parts, whom for our house and honor sake, I wish
thou wouldst confesse to marrie.
   [$ (^Dow.^) $] To marrie father? why we shall haue children.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Why that's the ende of marriage, and the ioye of
men.
   [$ (^Do.^) $] O how you are deceiued, you haue but me, & what
a trouble am I to your ioy? but father, if you long to haue
some fruite of me, see father I will creepe into this stuborne
earth and mixe my flesh with it, and they shall breede
grasse, to fat oxen, asses and such like, and when they in the
grasse the spring conuerts into beasts nourishment, then
comes the fruite of this my body forth; then may you well
say, seeing my race is so profitably increased, that good fat 
oxe, and that same large eard asse are my sonne sonnes, that
caulfe with a white face is his faire daughter, with which,
when your fields are richly filled, then will my race content
you, but for the ioyes of children, tush tis gone, children
will not deserue, nor parents take it: wealth is the onely
father & the child, and but in wealth no man hath any ioy.

with a new Sun, and made a nouell Phoenix, is she a 
woman that obiects this sight, able to worke the chaos of the
world into gestion? O diuine aspect, the excellent disposer
of the mind shines in thy beautie, and thou hast not 
chaunged my soule to sense but sense vnto my soule, and I desire
thy pure societie, but euen as angels do, to angels flie.            #

shall go with vs to the ordinarie, where you shall meete
Gentlemen of so good carriage, and passing co~plements, it
will do your hart good to see them, why you neuer saw the

their white vailes, accomplish the court Cupboord, waite
diligently to day for my credite and your owne, that if the 
meate should chance to be raw, yet your behauiors being
neither rude nor raw, may excuse it, or if the meate should 
chaunce to be tough, be you tender ouer them in your 
attendance, that the one may beare with the other.
<P D4V>
   [$ (^Iaq.^) $] Faith some of them bee so hard to please, finding
fault with your cheere, and discommending your wine,
saying, they fare better at Verones for halfe the mony.
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] Besides, if there be any cheboules in your napkins,
they say your nose or ours haue dropt on them, and then
they throw them about the house.
   [$ (^Ver.^) $] But these bee small faultes, you may beare with
them, young Gentlemen and wilde heades will be doing.

[$ (^Enter the Maide.^) $]
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] Come, whose wit was it to couer in this roome, 
name in the of God I trowee.
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] Why I hope this roome is as faire as the other.
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] In your foolish opinion: you might haue tolde a
wise body so, and kept your selfe a foole still.
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] I cry you mercie, how bitter you are in your 
prouerbs.
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] So bitter I am sir.

sawsily, that one house shall not holde vs two long, God

(^Iacenan^) , I must make an angry face outwardly, though I smile
inwardly.
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] Say what you will to me sir.
   [$ (^Ver.^) $] O you are a fine Gossip, can I not keepe honest
seruants in my house, but you must controule them? you
must be their mistres.
   [$ (^Maid.^) $] Why I did but take vp the cloth, because my 
mistresse would haue the dinner in an other roome, and hee
called me baggage.
<P E1R>
   [$ (^Iaq.^) $] You called me knaue and foole, I thanke you small 
bones.

yong gentleman spend his time but in play, and in courting
his Mistris: come vse this, least youth take too much of the

and both the bawde and the pander were carried to the

puddings were turned into three of the fairest Ladies in the
land for your sake, I would I were hanged, what a diuel can

cardes,
thou and I will haue some excellent sport: sirrah, dost thou
know that same Gentleman there?
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] No yfaith, what is he?
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] A very fine gull, and a neat reueller, one thats   #
heire
to a great liuing, yet his father keepes him so short, that his
shirts will scant couer the bottom of his belly, for all his gay
outside, but the linings be very foule and sweatie, yea and
perhappes lowsie, with dispising the vaine shiftes of the
world.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] But he hath gotten good store of money now me
thinks.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Yea, and I wonder of it, some ancient seruing man
of his fathers, that hath gotten fortie shillings in fiftie years
vpon his great good husbandrie, he swearing monstrous
othes to pay him againe, and besides to doe him a good
turne (when God shall heare his prayer for his father) hath
lent it him I warrant you, but howsoeuer, we must speake
him faire.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] O what else!
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] God saue sweete Monsieur (^Rowle^) , what loose or 
win, loose or win?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] Faith sir saue my selfe, and loose my money.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Theres a prouerbe hit dead in the necke like a 
Cony, why hearke thee (^Catalian^) , I could haue told thee 
before what he would haue said.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] I do not thinke so.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] No, thou seest heers a fine plumpe of gallants, such
as thinke their wits singular, and their selues rarely 
<P E3V>
accomplished, yet to shew thee how brittle their wittes be, I will 
speake to them seuerally, and I will tell thee before what 
they shall answer me.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] Thats excellent, lets see that yfaith.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Whatsoeuer I say to Monsieur (^Rowlee^) , he shall
say, O sir, you may see an ill weed growes apace.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] Come, lets see.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Now Monsieur (^Rowlee^) , me thinks you are 
exceedingly growne since your comming to Paris.
   [$ (^Row.^) $] O sir, you may see an ill weed growes a pace.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] This is excellent, forward sir I pray.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] What soere I say to (^Labesha^) , he shall answer  #
me,
blacke will beare no other hue, and that same olde Iustice,
as greedie of a stale prouerbe, he shall come in the necke
of that and say, Blacke is a pearle in a womans eye.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] Yea, much yfayth.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Looke thee, here comes hither (^Labesha^) ,        #
(^Catalian^) ,
and I haue beene talking of thy complexion, and (^I^) say, that
all the faire ladies in France would haue beene in loue with
thee, but that thou art so blacke.
   [$ (^Labe.^) $] O sir blacke will beare no other hue.
   [$ (^Foy.^) $] O sir blacke is a pearle in a womans eye.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] You say true sir, you say true sir, sirrah         #
(^Catalian^) ,
whatsoere (^I^) say to (^Berger^) that is so busie at Cardes, he shall
answer me, sblood, I do not meane to die as long as I can 
see one aliue.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] Come let vs see you.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Why (^Berger^) , I thought thou hadst beene dead,  #
(^I^)
haue not heard thee chide all this while.
   [$ (^Ber.^) $] Sblood, I do not meane to die, as long as I can see
one aliue.
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] Why but hearke you (^Lemot^) , I hope you cannot 
make this lord answer so roundly.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] O, as right as any of them all, and he shall 
aunswere mee with an olde Latine Prouerbe, that is, 
(^ (\vsus promptus facit\) ^) .
<P E4R>
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] Once more lets see.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] My lord, your lordship could not play at this game
verie latelie, and nowe me thinkes you are growne 
exceeding perfite.

brace of Crownes for thy labour, but let no bodie know of

this hand that I adore and reuerence, and loath to haue it,

fetcht me two or three fine capers aloft, and took my leaue

your wisest course is, euen to become puritane againe, put
off this vaine attire, and say, I haue despised all: thanks my
God, good husband, I do loue thee in the Lord, and he
(good man) will thinke all this you haue done, was but to
shew thou couldest gouerne the world, and hide thee as a 
rainebow doth a storme: my dainty wench, go go, what
shall the flattering words of a vaine man make you forget
your dutie to your husband? away, repent, amend your life,
you haue discredited your religion for euer.

malecontent, vpon some amorous disposition of his mistres, and
you know he loues a mease of cream, and a spice-cake with
his heart, and (^I^) am sure he hath not dined to day, and he hath

we will set a mease of creame, a spice-cake, and a spoone,

my beautie, that when he married me he thought diuine:
for euer blasted be that strumpets face, as all my hopes are
blasted, that did change them.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Nay Madam, though he saide your face was fat,

so filled vp, nor so prest downe in euery one as me, but yet (^I^)
promise you a little more: well, Ile go seeke my head, who
shal take me in the gates of his kind armes vntoucht of any.
   [$ (^King.^) $] What Madam are you so pure now?
   [$ (^Flo.^) $] Yea, would not you be pure?
   [$ (^King.^) $] No puritane.
   [$ (^Flo.^) $] You must be then a diuell, I can tell you.
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] O wife where hast thou beene?
   [$ (^Flo.^) $] where did I tell you I would be (^I^) pray.
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] In thy close walke thou saidst.
   [$ (^Flo.^) $] And was (^I^) not?
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Truly (^I^) know not, I neither looked nor knocked,
for (^Labesha^) told me that you, and faire (^Martia^) were at 
Verones ordinarie.
   [$ (^Ki.^) $] (^Labesha^) ? my lord you are a wise man to beleeue # 
a fool.
   [$ (^Flo.^) $] Well my good head, for my part I forgiue you: but
surely you do much offend to be suspicious: where there is
no trust, there is no loue, and where there is no loue twixt
man and wife, theres no good dealing surely: for as men
should euer loue their wiues, so should they euer trust the~,
for what loue is there where there is no trust?
   [$ (^King.^) $] She tels you true, my lord.
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Shee doth my liege; and deare wife pardon this
and (^I^) will neuer be suspicious more.
   [$ (^Flo.^) $] Why (^I^) say, (^I^) do.
[$ (^Enter Lemot, leading Labesha in a halter.^) $]
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Looke you my liege, (^I^) haue done simple seruice
amongest you, here is one had hanged himselfe for loue,
thinking his Mistresse had done so for him: well, see your
Mistresse liues.
   [$ (^Labesh.^) $] And doth my Mistresse liue?
<P G3V>
   [$ (^King.^) $] Shee doth, O noble knight, but not your 
Mistresse now.
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Sblood, but she shall for me, or for no body else.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] How now, what a traitor, draw vpon the King.
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Yea, or vpon any woman here in a good cause.
   [$ (^King.^) $] Well sweete (^Besha^) let her marry               #
(^Dowsecer^) , Ile get
thee a wife worth fifteene of her, wilt thou haue one that
cares not for thee?
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Not I by the Lord, I scorne her, Ile haue her better
if I can get her.
   [$ (^King.^) $] Why thats well said.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] What Madam, are you turned puritan againe?
   [$ (^Flo.^) $] When was I other, pray?
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Marie Ile tell you when, when you went to the
Ordinarie, and when you made false signes to your 
husband, which I could tell him all.
   [$ (^Flo.^) $] Cursed be he that maketh debate twixt man & wife.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] O rare scripturian! you haue sealed vp my lips, a 
hall, a hall, the pageant of the Butterie.

[$ (^Enter two with torches, the one of them Moren, then my host
and his son, then his maid drest like Queene 
Fortune, with two pots in her hands.^) $]
   [$ (^King.^) $] What is he?
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] This is Verones sonne, my liege.
   [$ (^King.^) $] What shall he do?
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] Speak some speach that his father hath made for him
   [$ (^Qu.^) $] Why is he good at speeches?
   [$ (^Cat.^) $] O he is rare at speaches.
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] Faire ladies most tender, and nobles most slender,
and gentles whose wits be scarce.
   [$ (^Ki.^) $] My host, why do you call vs nobles most slender?
   [$ (^Host.^) $] And it shall please your Grace, to be slender is  #
to be
proper, and therfore where my boy saies nobles most 
slender, it is as much to say, fine and proper nobles.
   [$ (^Le.^) $] Yea, but why do you call vs gentles whose wits are 
scarce.
<P G4R>
   [$ (^Host.^) $] To be scarce, is to be rare: and therefore where as
he sayes Gentles whose wits be scarce, is as much as to say,
Gentles whose wits be rare.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Well, forwards trunchman.
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] Faire ladies most tender, and nobles most slender,
and gentles whose wittes bee scarce, Queene Fortune
doth come with her trumpe, and her drumme, as it may 
appeare by my voice.
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Come hither, are you a schoolemaister, where was
Fortune Queene, of what countrey or kingdome?
   [$ (^Host.^) $] Wy sir, Fortune was Queene ouer all the world.
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Thats a lie, theres none that euer conquered all the
world, but maister (^Alisander^) , I am sure of that.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] O rare Monsieur (^Labesha^) , who would haue thought
hee could haue found so rare a fault in the speach.
   [$ (^Host.^) $] Ile alter it if it please your grace.
   [$ (^King.^) $] No, tis very well.
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] Father I must begin againe they interrupt me so.
   [$ (^Ho.^) $] I beseech your grace giue the boy leaue to begin    #
again.
   [$ (^King.^) $] With all my heart, tis so good we cannot heare
it too oft.
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] Faire ladies most tender, and nobles most slender,
and gentles whose wittes are scarce, Queene Fortune doth
come with her Fife, and her Drum, as it doth appeare by
my voice, here is Fortune good, but il by the rood, and this
naught but good shall do you, dealing the lots out of our
pots, and so good Fortune to you sir.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Looke you my liege, how hee that caries the torch
trembles extreamly.
   [$ (^Kin.^) $] I warrant tis with care to carie his torch well.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Nay there is something else in the wind: why my
host, what meanes thy man (^Iaques^) to tremble so?
   [$ (^Host:^) $] Hold still thou knaue, what art thou afraid to    #
looke
vpon the goodly presence of a king: hold vp for shame.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Alas poore man, he thinks tis (^Iaques^) his man:  #
poore
lord, how much is he bound to suffer for his wife?
<P G4V>
   [$ (^King^) $] Hearke you mine host, what goodly person is that?
is it Fortune her selfe?
   [$ (^Host.^) $] Ile tell your Maiestie in secrete who it is, it   #
is my 
maide (^Iaquena^) .
   [$ (^King.^) $] I promise you she becomes her state rarely.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Well my liege, you were all content that I should
make your poses: well here they be euery one: giue 
Master Verone his fiue crownes.
   [$ (^King.^) $] Theres mine and [^SOURCE TEXT: aud^] the Queenes.

   [$ (^Dow.^) $] And there is mine and (^Martias^) .
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Come (^Labesha^) thy money.
   [$ (^Lab^) $] You must lend me some, for my boy is runne away
with my purse.
   [$ (^Le.^) $] Thy boy? (^I^) neuer knew any that thou hadst.
   [$ (^Lab.^) $] Had not I a boy three or foure yeares ago, and he
ran away.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] And neuer since he went thou hadst not a peny,
but stand by, Ile excuse you. But sirrah (^Catalian^) , thou shalt
stand on one side and reade the prises, and I will stand on
the other and read the Poses.

villaines with me.

shillings in gold.

forme of an Eccho, as if you were seeking your husbande, and
fortune should be the Eccho, and this you say: where is my
husbande hid so long vnmaskt? maskt, sayes the Eccho: but in
what place sweet Fortune? let me heare: heare, sayes the Eccho.
   [$ (^King.^) $] There you lie Eccho, for if he were here we must
needes see him.
   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Indeed sweete King, there me thinkes the Eccho
must needes lie, if hee were here, wee must needes see him, tis 
one of them that caries the torches: no that cannot be neither, 
and yet by the Masse heres (^Iaques^) : why my host, did not you 
tell me that (^Iaques^) should be a torchbearer? who is this? Gods 
my life, my lord!

straight come home?
   [$ (^King.^) $] Why, who tolde you Madam, there were any there?

   [$ (^Lem.^) $] Who I stand to it! alas, I tolde you in kindnesse, #
and 
good will, because I would not haue you companie long from 
your husband.
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] Why loe, you bird, how much you are deceiued.
   [$ (^Co.^) $] Why wherefore were you afraid to be seene?
   [$ (^Mor.^) $] Who I afraid? alas I bore a torch to grace this
<P H2R>
honorable presence: for nothing els sweete bird.
   [$ (^King.^) $] Thankes good (^Moren^) , see lady with what wrong
you haue pursued your most inamored lord: but come, now
all are friends, now is this day spent with vnhurtfull motiues of
delight, and ouer ioyes more my senses at the night: and now

and he shall married be, and here I solemnly inuite you all
