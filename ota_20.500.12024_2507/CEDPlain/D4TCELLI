[^TEXT: THE TRIALL OF ELIZABETH CELLIER, AT THE KINGS-BENCH-BARR,

<P 5>
[$ (^John Gadbury^) Sworn.$]

   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr. (^Gadbury^) , What do you know concerning
this Plot?
   [$Mr. (^Gadbury.^) $] I know nothing of it, neither one way,     
nor another.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do you know of any Contrivance of Mrs.
(^Celliers^) , to kill the King?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] No; rather the contrary.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do you know of any attempts to (^change the 
Government^) :
   [$M (^G.^) $] I will tell your Lordship what I do know, if these 
(^Gentlemen^) will not be too nimble for me. I have suffered   
a (^great deal of Prejudice^) of late in relation to a Plot, as if I 
had known of a Plot; but God is my Witness, I know of 
none, unless it were a Plot to bring Sir (^Robert Peyton^) over 
to the (^Kings^) Interest. That Plot I had some Concern in, 
and had some knowledge of Mrs. (^Celliers^) Concern in it; 
but she was so far from doing any thing (^against the Kings 
Interest^) , that she was willing to bring over with him the 
three Gentlemen turn'd out of Commission when Sir 
(^Robert^) was. So that how she could be acting for the (^King^) , 
and against the (^King^) at the same time, I do not 
understand.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr. (^Gadbury^) , You are a man of Learning,   # 
pray 
will you give your (^Testimony^) of the things that you know 
in relation to Mrs. (^Cellier^) .
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Mrs. (^Cellier^) was not committed upon my 
Accusation; therefore, I hoped she might have been tryed 
without my (^Testimony^) . But when I was in danger of my  
<P 6>
Life, when I lay in the (^Gate-house^) , Mrs. (^Cellier^) was 
reported to be a third Witness against me, and then I raked up
every trifle: but if I had thought it Treason, I would have
discovered it before. And as to that particular Business
concerning Mr. (^Smith^) , that (^Smith^) sometime since did
come to me, being my old Acquaintance, to ask my 
advice in his Affairs, and he had then an Affair of so great
moment, that it was necessary to (^ask my Advice in it^) , which
was to go to the Lords in the Tower. I asked him what
to do? saith he, I can say enough against Dr. (^Oats^) to
serve them, and take off his Evidence, and asked me if he
should do it. By no means, Mr. (^Smith^) , said I. Mrs. 
(^Cellier^) afterwards told me, this (^Smith^) , and one             # 
(^Phillips^) were 
willing to tell some Stories or other of Mr. (^Oats^) and Mr.
(^Bedlow^) , and I told her this very Story; saith she, you being
acquainted with him, it is possible you may do some good
upon him, and saith she, I had as lieve as ten Guineys, that
you could do it.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] That is, when that you advised Mr. (^Smith^) not
to meddle with any thing against Dr. (^Oats^) .
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She said, she did not care if she had been at the
Charge of ten Guineys, if he would be honest and 
discover the Truth [^SOURCE TEXT: Trnth^] .  And, my Lord, she did   #
say she had heard
Mr. (^Dangerfield^) talk of a (^Nonconformists^) Plot that would
off the (^Popish^) Plot.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did she say, that she had heard                #
(^Dangerfield^) say 
there was a (^Nonconformists^) Plot, and that he was to have a
Commission among them? and did she say, that she had
heard him say, that he hoped under the colour of that, the
(^Popish^) Plot would go on? or did she say it of her own
accord, that she hoped that would carry on the (^Popish^)
Plot?
   [$Mr. (^Gad.^) $] My Lord, I cannot remember 
particulars.
<P 7>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] There is a great deal of difference 
between (^Dangerfields^) saying it, and her saying 
it.
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] I have no reason to spare her: but I am
unwilling to speak any thing that is contrary to
truth, though she hath done me the greatest 
Injury in the World.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How came you to talk of a (^Non-conformists^)
Plot?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] It was only common Discourse as it was 
at Coffee-Houses.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Had you heard of it before she spake of it,
that you say it was common?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] No, not till she spake of it.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did Mrs. (^Cellier^) tell you of any (^Popish^)
Priests or Jesuits coming hither from beyond the
Seas?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Upon the going over of one (^Clay^) , I think
she did say she heard there were some more 
coming over.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What to do?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] God knows what.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did she speak of any Plot or Contrivance
to kill the King?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] No, she was always an Enemy to Plots,
or else I would not have kept her Company.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did she say there were, or that she heard 
there were several Priests and Jesuits coming 
over?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, I think she said she heard it. And
I have said several times to her, the (^Popish Plotters^) 
would be destroyed: but she answered, she was 
afraid the Nation would be destroyed first.
<P 8>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did she say she was afraid of it, or, that
the Nation would be destroyed first? I ask you
once more, we must try People according to their
Oaths. By the Oath you have taken, when you said
you thought the (^Popish Plotters^) would be 
destroyed, what Answer did she make?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She said she was afraid the Nation would
be so; because, she said, abundance of the best of
the Nation went into other Nations, to weaken 
our Nation, and spend their Mony, and therefore
she was afraid the Nation would be destroyed 
before them.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What Discourse had you with Mrs. 
(^Cellier^) passing through (^Westminster Abby^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, my memory hath been 
exceedingly bruised; but I remember, my Lord, as
I was going through the Abby in a rainy 
afternoon, she said, this Abby was formerly filled with
(^Benedictine Monks^) , or something to that purpose,
and, saith she, what if it should be so again?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Are you a (^Protestant^) or a (^Papist^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] A (^Protestant^) , my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] He talks as like a (^Papist^) as can be, was it,
what if it should be filled?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She said, what if it should be 
again.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did you say to that?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] I only smiled to hear a Womans 
Discourse, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You make all the Company laugh, What
did she say of the Temple?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] That the (^Temple^) had been filled with 
(^Fryars^) too.
<P 9>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] And what then? Did she talk of filling it 
again?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Saith she, this Place was filled with (^Benedictine 
Monks^) , and the (^Temple^) with (^Fryars^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] This may do well enough: but what did she 
say else concerning the (^Temple^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Nothing, my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Serjeant Maynard^) said something to him here, which
was not heard, but Mr. (^Gadbury^) replyed.$]
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Mr. (^Serjeant^) , I was none of the Tribe of forty 
one.
   [$Here Mr. (^Gadbury^) was going to read in his Paper:
but the Court told him that would not be allowed; but he
might refresh his Memory with it.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Now tell me what she said: Mr (^Gadbury^) , keep
it in your Hand.
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, she put it by way of Interrogation to
feel my Pulse.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did she say else?
   [$M. (^G.^) $] There was nothing but transient Discourse, my
Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] We must ask you what the truth is, and you
have looked upon your Paper. Now, consider what you
say, and consider that you are upon a solemn Occasion,
and are to testify it in the presence of God Almighty. I
would have you tell plainly what it is, and neither to
make it more, nor stifle it.
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] It was only transient discourse.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Say what it was. Was it, this Place was once
filled with (^Benedictine Monks^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She said that the (^Abby^) had been filled with
(^Benedictine Monks^) , as the (^Temple^) had with (^Fryars^) .
   [$ (^J. Jones.^) $] Look upon your Paper.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You have looked upon the Paper, and pray tell
<P 10>
us what she said. Did she say she hoped to see this Place
filled with (^Benedictines^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, I do not remember that word
hope.
   [$ (^J. J.^) $] How long have you been acquainted with Mrs.
(^Cellier^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Ten or a dozen Years.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did she never ask you any Questions about
the Life of the King?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, when the King was very ill at 
(^Windsor^) , and all People were fearful that he would die, she did 
move the Question to me.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What Question?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] To know whether I thought his Majesty would
live or die: but it was her fear that he would die.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Had you seen the King?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How then did she expect you should give her
an Answer? from your Art?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] From my Art, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did she desire you to consult your Art, how
long the King would live?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She did as I said.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did you say to that?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] I would not tell her, because [^SOURCE TEXT:      #
becanse^] he was my 
Soveraign.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] VVhat Answer did you make?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] I told her I would not meddle with it.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] She would have had you consult your Art or
Scheme, or whatever it is, to know whether the King
would live or die?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] It was something of that.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] And you said you would not meddle nor make
with it?
<P 11> 
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] She desired you to make a Scheme?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] No, my Lord, I can't say she mentioned
a Scheme; but she asked the Question.
   [$ (^J. Raymend.^) $] What did she ask else?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Only that Question.   
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How often do you believe she spake of
it?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Never, my Lord, but when he was ill.
I will not baffle any thing that may conduce to the
safety of the King, and Kingdom.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Indeed it is very conducible to the 
safety of the King and Kingdom, if any go about to
destroy him, and with evil Intentions to ask how
long he will live, and you ought in Duty to God,
and your Soveraign, to declare it. Did she ever
make any enquiries about the Kings Death more
than what you have said?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] No more, my Lord, and then she was
fearful he would die.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did she say she would go to some Body
else?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, when she perceived me shy,
saith she, I see you are afraid of me, I will go to some
other (^Astrologer^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] For what?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] To satisfy her Curiosity, as a great many
do.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What Curiosities did she ask besides
this?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She would ask me sometimes about the 
Condition of Bodies, whether they would be 
prosperous in the World, and several other Questions
<P 12>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Were you nice in these Curiosities?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Truely, my Lord, I was shy of meddling with
any thing, when I heard there was a talk about Plots.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was you nice to give her satisfaction according
to her hopes concerning these things you call Curiosities,
questioning whether one should be well wedd, how 
many Children she should have, (^&c.^) VVere you scrupulous in 
that?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] I think I might not be nice in that very 
particular.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How came it then, that she would go to another
(^Astrologer^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She asked me something about Mr. 
(^Dangerfield^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] For what?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] How to get him out of Prison.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray how came she to say she would go to 
another (^Astrologer^) ? You were not shy to give her an answer 
to these Questions.
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] It was something about Mr. (^Dangerfield^) , My   #
Lord,
she asked me something about some Deeds or Papers
which he was to search for or seize, which concerned Mr.
(^Bedlow^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] She had better have gone to one of the Clerks
than to a (^Conjurer^) for them. But why would she go to 
another (^Astrologer^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Because I was shy.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You were not shy in these things about         #
(^Bedlow^) . 
Did she not say when you refused to meddle vvith the
death of the King, that she vvould go to another 
(^Astrologer^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did [^SOURCE TEXT: Dd^] you any thing for her  #
at that time?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, I did calculate a Scheme, vvhich since
I found to be for (^Mr. Dangerfield^) , but I knevv not for          #
[^SOURCE TEXT: fot^] whom
it vvas vvhen I did it.
<P 13>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How! Can you apply one Scheme to any Body?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, when Mrs. (^Cellier^) came to me, she    #
gave me the 
time of a Persons Nativity, and I set the Figure of the Heavens to     
that Sign, to know whether he were a Person fit to be trusted, her    
Husband being a (^French Merchant^) to get in Money.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] For ought you know, (^Dangerfield^) was a      #
Woman, and
the question was, whether (^Dangerfield^) was with Child, and he
happens to be a Man. -- How did it fall out?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] I have forgotten, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] When did you know it was for (^Dangerfield^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] My Lord, never before I came before the King and 
Councel, neither did I know his Name before; for he went by the Name
of (^Willoughby^) before.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What other Discourse had you with her? Did she #
not at 
any time talk of Mr. (^Dugdale^) ?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She did say, she had heard of some People that    #
were to 
discourse with Mr. (^Dugdale^) : she had heard such a thing; but I
don't know whether she knew any thing of it or no.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What discourse had you about that?
   [$Mr. (^G.^) $] She told me, there was a Woman to go down to      #
(^Windsor^) 
to beg Mr. (^Dugdale's^) Pardon; for he was penitent for what he
had said in some Tryal or other.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Call another Witness.
   [$ (^Attor. Gen.^) $] Mr. (^Dangerfield^) , pray give the Court   #
an account of 
what you know of Mrs. (^Cellier^) , the Prisoner at the Bar.
   [$Mrs. (^Cel.^) $] My Lord, I accept against that Witness.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Why so? You must show some reason, and then we #
will 
do you Justice in God's Name.
   [$Mrs. (^C.^) $] If I can prove he was whipt, and transported,    #
pilloryed, 
perjured, (^&c.^) he is no Witness. The last time I was upon my
Tryal, he threatned some of my VVitnesses, that if they would not
Swear as he would have them, he would kill them.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] If you can shew any Record whereby he is       #
convicted of 
any thing, that can by Law take away his [^SOURCE TEXT: bis^]        #
Testimony, do it.
   [$Mrs. (^C.^) $] He has been Indicted for Burglary.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) (to Mr. (^Dangerfield^) ) $] VVas you Indicted    #
for Burglary?
   [$Mr. (^Danger.^) $] I will take it at their Proof.

[$ (^Ralph Briscoe^) , a VVitness for the Defendent, Sworn.$]

   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do you know (^Dangerfield^) ?
   [$ (^Briscoe.^) $] I remember one (^Thomas Dangerfield^) . I saw  #
him burnt 
in the Hand at the (^Old-Baily^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Is this the same Man?
<P 14>
   [$ (^Bris.^) $] I do believe it is the same Man: but I have not   #
seen 
him these several Years.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Let every Body have their right in God's Name. #
Have 
you any more?
   [$Mrs. (^C.^) $] My Lord, I can prove him perjured.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Have you any Records to shew he was perjured?  #
is he 
convinced?
   [$Mrs. (^C.^) $] No.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Then you can't do it.
   [$Mrs. (^C.^) $] My Lord, I can prove him guilty of Forgery.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] If you don't produce the Record, you do nothing.
   [$ (^R.^) $] That which she calls Forgery, is not that which the  #
Law calls 
Forgery: it is counterfeiting Guineys.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Can you shew he forged any Deeds. If you can   #
prove 
that he hath committed Forgery, and be not convicted, it is no       #
Errour.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Have you your Pardon? She hath proved the
Conviction of Felony, prove your Pardon.
   [$Mrs. (^C.^) $] I have the Copies of several Records here in     #
Court, 
which will be sworn to.
   [$To which Mr. (^Dangerfield^) pleaded his Majesties most gracious       
Pardon. To which Mrs. (^Cellier^) replyed, that she had a Copy of the
said Pardon in Court, but it did not extend to some of the Crimes 
for which he stood convicted, and then produced a Record, 
wherein it did appear, he was outlawed upon Fellony. Upon which the 
Court commanded Mr. (^Dangerfield^) to go and fetch his Pardon, in
the (^interim^) examining several of the Kings VVitnesses.$]
[$ (^Thomas Williamson^) Sworn.$] 
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you ever see (^Dangerfield^) and Mrs.      #
(^Cellier^) in company?      
   [$ (^Williamson.^) $] No, my Lord, but I have been imployed for   #
Mrs. 
(^Cellier^) in several Businesses of Charity to get Prisoners out.   #
VVhen 
Mr. (^Dangerfield^) was in Newgate, she imployed me to get him out.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] VVhy was she so kind to (^Dangerfield^) ?
   [$ (^W.^) $] My Lord, I don't know that: but she bid me get him   #
out, 
whosoever staid behind.
   [$ (^J. R.^) $] VVhy should she get him out? Did she tell you what 
she would do with him when she had him out?
   [$ (^W.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^R.^) $] VVe bring him for a VVitness, that she had a great   #
kindness 
for (^Dangerfield^) .
[$ (^Margaret Jenkens^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] VVhat discourse have you heard between         #
(^Dangerfield^) 
and (^Cellier^) ?
<P 15>
   [$ (^J.^) $] I never saw them together but twice. It is a Year    #
since I 
came from them.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] When you saw them at Dinner or Supper          #
together, what 
other Company was there?
   [$ (^J.^) $] Her Husband was with her one time.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did they talk about?
   [$ (^J.^) $] They were talking about the Prisoners that were 
Condemned.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Where was it? at her House?
   [$ (^J.^) $] No, at my Lady (^Powis's^) House.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How came you there?
   [$ (^J.^) $] I carried Notes backwards and forwards.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you never hear no discourse about the Plot?
   [$ (^J.^) $] No.
[$ (^Susan Edwards^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^R.^) $] What Intimacy have you known between (^Dangerfield^) #
and 
Mrs. (^Celliers^) ?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you ever see them together?
   [$ (^Edwards.^) $] Yes, very often, my Lord. She said that the    #
(^Popish Plot^) 
would turn to a (^Presbyterian Plot^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Who did she say that to? to (^Dangerfield^) ?
   [$ (^E.^) $] No, my Lord, but I have heard him say those words,   #
and that 
he would make it his Interest it should be so.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did you say to him, when he said he must  #
turn 
Rogue, and discover all their Plots?
   [$ (^E.^) $] I said he would be no greater Rogue than he was      #
before.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You were pritty nimble with him.
   [$ (^E.^) $] He thought he should be hanged.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] For what?
   [$ (^E.^) $] If he did not turn Rogue, he thought he should be    #
hanged.
   [$ (^E.^) (to Mrs. (^Cellier^) ) $] You were very often together  #
in your 
Chamber.
   [$Mrs. (^C.^) $] Who gave you your Cloaths?
   [$ (^E.^) $] Her Husband was gone to Church one Morning, and he   #
was 
with her in her Chamber.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] I can't see why you should prove this matter   #
too far.
   [$ (^R.^) $] (^Susan^) is a civil young Woman.
   [$ (^E.^) $] She said she would do my business for me, and I go   #
in danger 
of my Life.
[$ (^Bennet Dowdal^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What do you know of any Intimacy between       #
(^Dangerfield^) 
and Mrs. (^Cellier^) ?
<P 16>
   [$ (^Dowd.^) $] I have seen them together.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What did they talk about?
   [$ (^D.^) $] Mrs. (^Cellier^) proposed a match between Mrs.       #
(^Mary Ayrey^) and 
I, and they used to talk of that when I was with them.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did they talk of the Plot at any time?
   [$ (^D.^) $] No.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you ever hear them talk of the King?
   [$ (^D.^) $] No.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Have you any more?
   [$ (^R.^) $] Not till Mr. (^Dangerfield^) comes.
   [$ (^L-C. J.^) (to Mrs. (^Cellier^) ) $] Have you any Record to   #
shew he was 
put in the Pillory.
   [$Mrs. (^C.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$Upon which the Copy of a Record from (^Salisbury^) was read, of
his standing on the Pillory, for uttering counterfiet Guines. As
also, the Copy of a Record of an Outlawry for Felony.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What say you to this Outlawry?
   [$ (^R.^) $] It is not the same Person.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] We ought to be very careful in these Concerns, #
else we 
may do a work this day, may make all the Kingdom rue it. It is a
sad thing that People of a vitious profligate Life, both before they
came to Newgate, and all along in their Life time, should be 
suffered to be VVitnesses to take away the Life of a worm. I question
whether he will come again, or no, he hath been gone a great
while. Such are fit to be imployed to find out: but hard to be 
believed when they find out.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Captain (^Richardson^) , is this the Man that  #
broke 
(^Chelmsford Goal^) ?
   [$Cap. (^Rich.^) $] My Lord, I can say nothing to that; but he was 
brought by an (^ (\Habeas Corpus\) ^) from thence to me.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] was he burnt in the hand for Fellony?
   [$ (^C. R.^) $] Yes, my Lord, I believe he was.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] He made me believe as though he would flie, I  #
believe he 
is. VVe will not hood-wink our selves against such a Fellow as
this, that is guilty of so notorious Crimes. A man of Modesty
after he hath been in the Pillory, would not look a Man in the Face.
It appears that after he hath been burnt in the Hand, he hath been
outlawed for Fellony, and so it doth appear by Record.
   [$After about half an hours stay, Mr. (^Dangerfield^) returned and 
brought his Pardon, which was read, and the word Fellony 
omitted, and in stead of (^ (\Utlagaria Qualiacunque pro Felloniis        
<P 17>
quibuscunque\) ^) , there was only inserted, (^ (\Omnia Maleficia &  #
Utlagaria
qualiacunque\) ^) , which Omission had made the Pardon Defective, it # 
being my 
Lord Chief Justice his Opinion, that the word (^ (\Utlagaria\) ^)    #
did only 
reach to (^Outlawries^) between Party and Party, by which his 
Evidence was wholly laid aside.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) (to Mr. (^Dangerfield^) ) $] Such Fellows as you  #
are, Sirrah, 
shall know we are not afraid of you.
   He produces us here a Pardon by the Name of (^Thomas Dangerfield^) 
of (^Waltham^) , and says, his Father and Kinsman are both of that   #
Name 
and Place. VVill you have him Sworn whether his Father or 
Cozen (^Thomas^) was ever convicted of Felony. It is notorious
enough what a Fellow this is, he was in (^Chelmsford Goal^) . I will 
shake all such Fellows before I have done with them.  Have 
you any more to say? Are there any (^Waltham Men^) here?
   [$Mr. (^Dan.^) $] My Lord, this is enough to discourage a man     #
from ever 
entring into an honest Principle.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What? Do you with all the mischief that Hell   #
hath in you 
think to brave it in a Court [^SOURCE TEXT: Cout^] of Justice? I     #
wonder at your 
Impudence, that you dare look a Court of Justice in the Face, after 
having been made appear so notorious a Villain.
   [$ (^J. Jones.^) $] Indeed, if he be the same Man, he is not fit  #
for a (^Witness^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] And that he is the same Man is very notorious. #
Come 
Mrs. (^Celliers^) , What have you more to say?
   [$ (^Mrs. C.^) $] Enough, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You have said enough already. Come Gentlemen   #
of the 
Jury, this is a plain Case, here is but one Witness in a Case of 
Treason, and that not direct, therefore lay your heads together.
   [$Which being done, they returned her not guilty, upon which
the Clerk of the Crown bid her down on her Knees, which she did,
and cryed, God bless the King and Duke of York.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] VVhere is (^Dangerfield^) ? Is he gone? Call   #
him.
   [$VVho being come, the Court asked if he had Baile for the good 
Behaviour.$]
   [$Mr. (^D.^) $] No, my Lord, but with the leave of the Court,     #
will fetch 
some.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Let a (^Tipstaff^) go with him, and return     #
before the Court 
rises.
   [$Mr. (^D.^) $] My Lord, that cannot be, for I can't return so    #
soon.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Then let him be committed.
   [$VVhich was accordingly done.$]
