   [$The said (^Elizabeth Sowtherns^) confesseth, and
sayth; That about twentie yeares past, as she
was comming homeward from begging,
there met her this Examinate neere vnto a
Stonepit in (^Gouldshey^) , in the sayd Forrest of
(^Pendle^) , a Spirit or Deuill in the shape of a Boy, the one
halfe of his Coate blacke, and the other browne, who bade
this Examinate stay, saying to her, that if she would giue
him her Soule, she should haue any thing that she would
request. Wherevpon this Examinat demaunded his name?
and the Spirit answered, his name was (^Tibb^) : and so this
Examinate in hope of such gaine as was promised by the
sayd Deuill or (^Tibb^) , was contented to giue her Soule to the
said Spirit: And for the space of fiue or sixe yeares next
after, the sayd Spirit or Deuill appeared at sundry times vnto
her this Examinate about (^Day-light^) Gate, alwayes bidding
her stay, and asking her this Examinate what she would
<P B3R>
haue or doe? To whom this Examinate replyed,$] Nay
nothing: [$for she this Examinate said, she wanted nothing yet.
And so about the end of the said sixe yeares, vpon a
Sabboth day in the morning, this Examinate hauing a litle
Child vpon her knee, and she being in a slumber, the sayd
Spirit appeared vnto her in the likenes of a browne Dogg,
forcing himselfe to her knee, to get blood vnder her left
Arme: and she being without any apparrell sauing her
Smocke, the said Deuill did get blood vnder her left arme.
And this Examinate awaking, sayd,$] (^Iesus saue my Child^) ; [$but
had no power, nor could not say, (^Iesus saue her selfe^) :
wherevpon the Browne Dogge vanished out of this Examinats
sight: after which, this Examinate was almost starke madd
for the space of eight weekes.$]
   [$And vpon her examination, she further confesseth, and
saith. That a little before Christmas last, this Examinates
Daughter hauing been to helpe (^Richard Baldwyns^) Folkes
at the Mill: This Examinates Daughter did bid her this
Examinate goe to the said (^Baldwyns^) house, and aske him
some thing for her helping of his Folkes at the Mill, (as
aforesaid:) and in this Examinates going to the said 
(^Baldwyns^) house, and neere to the said house, she mette with the
said (^Richard Baldwyn^) ; Which (^Baldwyn^) sayd to this
Examinate, and the said (^Alizon Deuice^) (who at that time
ledde this Examinate, being blinde) $] get out my ground
Whores and Witches, I will burne the one of you, and
hang the other. [$To whom this Examinate answered:$] I
care not for thee, hang thy selfe: [$Presently wherevpon,
at this Examinates going ouer the next hedge, the said
Spirit or Diuell called (^Tibb^) , appeared vnto this Examinat,
and sayd,$] (^Reuenge thee of him^) . [$To whom, this Examinate
sayd againe to the said Spirit.$] (^Reuenge thee eyther of him, or
his^) . [$And so the said Spirit vanished out of her sight, and she
<P B3V>
neuer saw him since.$]
   [$And further this Examinate confesseth, and sayth, that
the speediest way to take a mans life away by 
VVitchcraft, is to make a Picture of Clay, like vnto the shape of
the person whom they meane to kill, & dry it thorowly:
and when they would haue them to be ill any one place
more then an other; then take a Thorne or Pinne, and
pricke it in that part of the Picture you would so haue
to be ill: and when you would haue any part of the 
Body to consume away, then take that part of the Picture,
and burne it. And when they would haue the whole
body to consume away, then take the remnant of the sayd
Picture, and burne it: and so therevpon by that meanes,
the body shall die.$]

to receiue the Communion (the next day after being
Good Friday) and then not to eate the Bread the

this Examinate answered, hee had not: and thereupon
the said thing threatned to pull this Examinate in

beene haunted and vexed with some women, who haue
vsed to come to her: which women, shee sayth, were
(^Iennet Bierley^) , this Informers Grand-mother; (^Ellen

the wife
of (^Iohn Southworth^) , and one (^Old Doewife^) , all of

foure women did violently draw her by the haire of the
head, and layd her on the toppe of a Hay-mowe, in
the said (^Henry Bierleyes^) Barne. And shee saith further,
That not long after the said (^Iennet Bierley^) did meete
this Examinate neere vnto the place where shee dwelleth,
and first appeared in her owne likenesse, and after
that in the likenesse of a blacke Dogge, and as this
Examinate did goe ouer a Style, shee picked her off: 
howbeit shee saith shee had no hurt then, but rose againe,
and went to her Aunts in Osbaldeston, and returned
backe againe to her Fathers house the same night,
being fetched home by her father. And she saith, That
in her way home-wards shee did then tell her Father,
<P L1R>
how shee had beene dealt withall both then and at
sundry times before that; and before that time she neuer
told any bodie thereof: and being examined why she
did not, she sayth, she could not speake thereof, though
she desired so to doe. And she further sayth, That
vpon Saterday, being the fourth of this instant Aprill,
shee this Examinate going towards Salmesbury bote,
to meete her mother, comming from Preston, shee saw
the said (^Iennet Bierley^) , who met this Examinate at a
place called the Two Brigges, first in her owne shape,
and afterwards in the likenesse of a blacke Dogge, with
two legges, which Dogge went close by the left side of
this Examinate, till they came to a Pitte of Water, and
then the said Dogge spake, and persuaded this 
Examinate to drowne her selfe there, saying, it was a faire and
an easie death: Whereupon this Examinate thought
there came one to her in a white sheete, and carried
her away from the said Pitte, vpon the comming
whereof the said black Dogge departed away; and
shortly after the said white thing departed also: And
after this Examinate had gone further on her way,
about the length of two or three Fields, the said blacke
Dogge did meete her againe, and going on her left side,
as aforesaid, did carrie her into a Barne of one (^Hugh
Walshmans^) , neere there by, and layed her vpon the
Barne-floore, and couered this Examinate with Straw
on her bodie, and Haye on her head, and the Dogge
it selfe lay on the toppe of the said Straw, but how
long the said Dogge lay there, this Examinate cannot
tell, nor how long her selfe lay there: for shee sayth,
That vpon her lying downe there, as aforesaid, her
Speech and Senses were taken from her: and the first
<P L1V>
time shee knew where shee was, shee was layed vpon a
bedde in the said (^Walshmans^) house, which (as shee hath
since beene told) was vpon the Monday at the night 
following: and shee was also told, That shee was found
and taken from the place where shee first lay, by some
of her friends, and carried into the said (^Walshmans^)
house, within a few houres after shee was layed in the
Barne, as aforesaid. And shee further sayth, That vpon
the day following, being Tuesday, neere night of the
same day, shee this Examinate was fetched by her Father
and Mother from the said (^Walshmans^) house to her
Fathers house. And shee saith, That at the place
before specified, called the Two Brigges, the said (^Iennet
Bierley^) and (^Ellen Bierley^) did appeare vnto her in their
owne shapes: whereupon this Examinate fell downe,
and after that was not able to speake, or goe, till the
Friday following: during which time, as she lay in her
Fathers house, the said (^Iennet Bierley^) and (^Ellen Bierley^) did
once appeare vnto her in their owne shapes, but they
did nothing vnto her then, neither did shee euer see
them since. And shee further sayth, That a good
while before all this, this Examinate did goe with the
said (^Iennet Bierley^) , her Grand-mother, and the said
(^Ellen Bierley^) her Aunt, at the bidding of her said
Grand-mother, to the house of one (^Thomas Walshman^) , 
in Salmesbury aforesaid. And comming
thither in the night, when all the house-hold was
abed, the doores being shut, the said (^Iennet Bierley^)
did open them, but this Examinate knoweth not
how: and beeing come into the said house, this
Examinate and the said (^Ellen Bierley^) stayed there,
and the said (^Iennet Bierley^) went into the Chamber
<P L2R>
where the said (^Walshman^) and his wife lay, & from thence
brought a little child, which this Examinate thinketh  
was in bed with it Father and Mother: and after the said
(^Iennet Bierley^) had set her downe by the fire, with the 
said child, shee did thrust a naile into the nauell of the
said child: and afterwards did take a pen and put it in at
the said place, and did suck there a good space, and 
afterwards laid the child in bed againe: and then the said
(^Iennet^) and the said (^Ellen^) returned to their owne houses,
and this Examinate with them. And shee thinketh that
neither the said (^Thomas Walshman^) , nor his wife knew that
the said child was taken out of the bed from them. And
shee saith also, that the said child did not crie when it
was hurt, as aforesaid: But she saith, that shee thinketh
that the said child did thenceforth languish, and not
long after dyed. And after the death of the said child;
the next night after the buriall thereof, the said (^Iennet
Bierley & Ellen Bierley^) , taking this Examinate with them,
went to Salmesburie Church, and there did take vp the
said child, and the said (^Iennet^) did carrie it out of the
Church-yard in her armes, and then did put it in her lap
and carryed it home to her owne house, and hauing it
there did boile some therof in a Pot, and some did broile
on the coales, of both which the said (^Iennet^) and (^Ellen^) did
eate, and would haue had this Examinate and one (^Grace
Bierley^) , Daughter of the said (^Ellen^) , to haue eaten with
them, but they refused so to doe: And  afterwards the
said (^Iennet & Ellen^) did seethe the bones of the said child
in a pot, & with the Fat that came out of the said bones,
they said they would annoint themselues, that thereby
they might sometimes change themselues into other
shapes. And after all this being done, they said they
<P L2V>
would lay the bones againe in the graue the next night
following, but whether they did so or not, this
Examinate knoweth not: Neither doth shee know how they 
got it out of the graue at the first taking of it vp. And 
being further sworne and examined, she deposeth & saith,
that about halfe a yeare agoe, the said (^Iennet Bierley, Ellen
Bierley, Iane Southworth^) , and this Examinate (who went
by the appointment of the said (^Iennet^) her Grand
mother) did meete at a place called Red banck, vpon the
North-side of the water of Ribble, euery Thursday and
Sonday at night by the space of a fortnight, and at the
water side there came vnto them, as they went thether,
foure black things, going vpright, and yet not like men
in the face: which foure did carrie the said three women
and this Examinate ouer the Water, and when they
came to the said Red Banck, they found some thing there
which they did eate. But this Examinate saith, shee
neuer saw such meate; and therefore shee durst not eate
thereof, although her said Grand mother did bidde her
eate. And after they had eaten, the said three Women
and this Examinate danced, euery one of them with one
of the black things aforesaid, and after their dancing the
said black things did pull downe the said three Women,
and did abuse their bodies, as this Examinate thinketh,
for shee saith, that the black thing that was with her, did
abuse her bodie.$]
   [$The said Examinate further saith vpon her Oth, That
about ten dayes after her Examination taken at
Blackborne, shee this Examinate being then come to her
Fathers house againe, after shee had beene certaine dayes
at her Vnckles house in Houghton: (^Iane Southworth^)
widow, did meet this Examinate at her Fathers house dore
<P L3R>
and did carrie her into the loft, and there did lay her
vppon the floore, where shee was shortly found by her
Father and brought downe, and laid in a bed, as afterwards
shee was told: for shee saith, that from the first meeting
of the said (^Iane Southworth^) , shee this Examinate had her
speech and senses taken from her. But the next day shee
saith, shee came somewhat to her selfe, and then the said
Widow (^Southworth^) came againe to this Examinate to
her bed-side, and tooke her out of bed, and said to this
Examinate, that shee did her no harme the other time, 
in respect of that shee now would after doe to her, and
thereupon put her vpon a hey-stack, standing some three
or foure yards high from the earth, where shee was
found after great search made, by a neighbours Wife
neare dwelling, and then laid in her bed againe, where
she remained speechlesse and senselesse as before, by the
space of two or three daies: And being recouered,
within a weeke after shee saith, that the said (^Iane Southworth^)
did come againe to this Examinate at her fathers house
and did take her away, and laid her in a ditch neare to
the house vpon her face, and left her there, where shee
was found shortly after, and laid vpon a bedde, but had
not her senses againe of a day & a night, or thereabouts.
And shee further saith, that vpon Tuesday last before
the taking of this her Examination, the said (^Iane
Southworth^) came to this Examinates Fathers house, and 
finding this Examinate without the doore, tooke her and
carried her into the Barne, and thrust her head amongst
a companie of boords that were there standing, where
shee was shortly after found and laid in a bedde, and
remained in her old fit till the Thursday at night
following.$]
<P L3V>
   [$And being further examined touching her being at
Red-bancke, shee saith, That the three women, by her
before named, were carried backe againe ouer Ribble,
by the same blacke things that carried them thither; and
saith that at their said meeting in the Red-bancke, there
did come also diuers other women, and did meete them
there, some old, some yong, which this Examinate 
thinketh did dwell vpon the North-side of Ribble, because
she saw them not come ouer the Water: but this
Examinate knew none of them, neither did she see them eat
or dance, or doe any thing that the rest did, sauing
that they were there and looked on.$]
   [$These particular points of Euidence being thus
vrged against the Prisoners: the father of this (^Grace

Robinsons^) , there appeared vnto her a thing like vnto a
Blacke Dogge: speaking vnto her, this Examinate, and
desiring her to giue him her Soule, and he would giue
her power to doe any thing she would: whereupon this
Examinate being therewithall inticed, and setting her
downe; the said Blacke-Dogge did with his mouth (as
this Examinate then thought) sucke at her breast, a little
below her Paps, which place did remaine blew halfe a 
yeare next after: which said Blacke-Dogge did not 
appeare to this Examinate, vntill the eighteenth day of
March last: at which time this Examinate met with a 
Pedler on the high-way, called Colne-field, neere vnto
Colne: and this Examinate demanded of the said
Pedler to buy some pinnes of him; but the said Pedler
sturdily answered this Examinate that he would not loose
his Packe; and so this Examinate parting with him:
presently there appeared to this Examinate the 
Blacke-Dogge, which appeared vnto her as before: which Black
<P R4R>
Dogge spake vnto this Examinate in English, saying;$]
What wouldst thou haue me to do vnto yonder man? [$to
whom this Examinate said,$] What canst thou do at him?
[$and the Dogge answered againe,$] I can lame him: 
[$whereupon this Examinat answered, and said to the said Black
Dogge,$] Lame him: [$and before the Pedler was gone
fortie Roddes further, he fell downe Lame: and this
Examinate then went after the said Pedler; and in a house
about the distance aforesaid, he was lying Lame: and so
this Examinate went begging in Trawden Forrest that
day, and came home at night: and about fiue daies next
after, the said Black-Dogge did appeare to this 
Examinate, as she was going a begging, in a Cloase neere the
New-Church in Pendle, and spake againe to her, saying;$]
Stay and speake with me; [$but this Examinate would
not: Sithence which time this Examinat neuer saw him.$]

Packe of wares at his backe thorow Colne-field: where 
vnluckily he met with (^Alizon Deuice^) , now Prisoner at
the Barre, who was very earnest with him for pinnes, but
he would giue her none: whereupon she seemed to be
very angry; and when hee was past her, hee fell downe
lame in great extremitie; and afterwards by meanes got
into an Ale-house in Colne, neere vnto the place where
hee was first bewitched: and as hee lay there in great
paine, not able to stirre either hand or foote; he saw a
great Black-Dogge stand by him, with very fearefull
firie eyes, great teeth, and a terrible countenance, looking
him in the face; whereat he was very sore afraid: and
immediately after came in the said (^Alizon Deuice^) , who
staid not long there, but looked on him, and went away.$]

night with the said (^Alizon Deuice^) ; and so continued

said to her,$] (^This thou knowest to be too true^) : [$and thereupon
