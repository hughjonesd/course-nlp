[}ACT II. SCENE I.}]

[$SCENE (^Continues^) .$]

[$ (^Enter^) Bevil (^jun. and^) Tom.$]

   [$ (^Tom.^) $] Sir, Mr. (^Myrtle^) .
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Very well, -- do you step again,
and wait for an Answer to my Letter.

[$ (^Enter^) Myrtle.$]

   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Well (^Charles^) , why so much Care in thy
Countenance? Is there any thing in this World 
deserves it? You, who used to be so Gay, so Open, 
so Vacant!
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] I think we have of late chang'd 
Complexions. You, who us'd to be much the graver Man, are 
now all Air in your Behaviour -- But the Cause of 
my Concern, may, for ought I know, be the same 
Object that gives you all this Satisfaction. In a word, I 
am told that you are this very Day (and your Dress 
confirms me in it) to be married to (^Lucinda^) .
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] You are not misinform'd. -- Nay, put not
on the Terrors of a Rival, till you hear me out. I shall
disoblige the best of Fathers, if I don't seem ready to
marry (^Lucinda^) : And you know I have ever told you,
you might make use of my secret Resolution never to
marry her, for your own service, as you please. But I
am now driven to the extremity of immediately 
<P 24>
refusing, or complying, unless you help me to escape the
Match.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] Escape? Sir, neither her Merit or her
Fortune are below your Acceptance. -- Escaping, do you
call it!
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Dear Sir, do you wish I should desire the
Match?
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] No -- but such is my humorous and sickly
state of Mind, since it has been able to relish nothing
but (^Lucinda^) , that tho' I must owe my Happiness to
your Aversion to this Marriage, I can't bear to hear her
spoken of with Levity or Unconcern.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Pardon me, Sir; I shall transgress that way
no more. She has Understanding, Beauty, Shape,
Complexion, Wit --
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] Nay, dear (^Bevil^) , don't speak of her as if 
you lov'd her, neither.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Why then, to give you Ease at once, tho'
I allow (^Lucinda^) to have good Sense, Wit, Beauty 
and Virtue; I know another, in whom these Qualities 
appear to me more amiable than in her.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] There you spoke like a reasonable and 
good-natur'd Friend. When you acknowledge her Merit, 
and own your Prepossession for another, at once, you 
gratify my Fondness, and cure my Jealousie.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] But all this while you take no notice, 
you have no Apprehension of another Man, that has 
twice the Fortune of either of us.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] (^Cimberton!^) Hang him, a Formal, 
Philosophical, Pedantick Coxcomb -- For the Sot, with all these
crude notions of divers things, under the direction of
great Vanity, and very little Judgment, shews his 
strongest Bias is Avarice; which is so predominant in 
him, that he will examine the Limbs of his Mistress 
with the Caution of a Jockey, and pays no more 
Compliment to her personal Charms, than if she 
were a meer breeding Animal.
<P 25>
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Are you sure that is not affected? I have
known some Women sooner set on fire by that sort 
of Negligence, than by --
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] No, no; hang him, the Rogue has no Art,
it is pure simple Insolence and Stupidity.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Yet, with all this, I don't take him for a
Fool.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] I own the Man is not a Natural; he has a
very quick Sense, tho' very slow Understanding. -- 
He says indeed many things, that want only the
circumstances of Time and Place to be very just and
agreeable.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Well, you may be sure of me, if you can
disappoint him; but my Intelligence says, the Mother
has actually sent for the Conveyancer, to draw 
Articles for his Marriage with (^Lucinda^) ; tho' those for 
mine with her, are, by her Father's Order, ready for 
signing: but it seems she has not thought fit to 
consult either him or his Daughter in the matter.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] Pshaw! A poor troublesome Woman --
Neither (^Lucinda^) nor her Father will ever be brought
to comply with it, -- besides, I am sure (^Cimberton^) can
make no Settlement upon her, without the 
Concurrence of his great Uncle Sir (^Geoffry^) in the West.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Well Sir, and I can tell you, that's the
very Point that is now laid before her Council; to
know whether a firm Settlement can be made, 
without this Uncle's actual joyning in it. -- Now pray 
consider, Sir, when my Affair with (^Lucinda^) comes, as 
it soon must, to an open Rupture, how are you sure 
that (^Cimberton's^) Fortune may not then tempt her 
Father too, to hear his Proposals?
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] There you are right indeed, that must be
provided against. -- Do you know who are her 
Council?
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Yes, for your Service I have found out 
that too, they are Serjeant (^Bramble^) and Old (^Target^) -- 
by the way, they are neither of 'em known in the
<P 26>
Family; now I was thinking why you might not put  
a couple of false Council upon her, to delay and 
confound matters a little -- besides, it may probably let 
you into the bottom of her whole Design against you.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] As how pray?
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Why, can't you slip on a Black Whig and
a Gown, and be Old (^Bramble^) your self?
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] Ha! I don't dislike it -- but what shall I 
do for a Brother in the Case?
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] What think you of my Fellow, (^Tom^) ? the
Rogue's intelligent, and is a good Mimick; all his part
will be but to stutter heartily, for that's Old (^Target's^) 
Case -- Nay, it would be an immoral thing to mock
him, were it not that his Impertinence is the occasion
of its breaking out to that degree -- the Conduct of
the Scene will chiefly lye upon you.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] I like it of all things; if you'll send (^Tom^) to
my Chambers, I will give him full Instructions: This
will certainly give me occasion to raise Difficulties, to
puzzle, or confound her Project for a while, at least.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] I'll warrant you Success: so far we are 
right then: And now, (^Charles^) , your apprehension of
my marrying her, is all you have to get over.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] Dear (^Bevil^) ! tho' I know you are my Friend,
yet when I abstract my self from my own interest in
the thing, I know no Objection she can make to you,
or you to her, and therefore hope --
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Dear (^Myrtle^) , I am as much obliged to 
you for the Cause of your Suspicion, as I am offended 
at the Effect: but be assured, I am taking measures 
for your certain Security, and that all things with 
regard to me will end in your entire Satisfaction.
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] Well, I'll promise you to be as easy and as
confident as I can; tho' I cannot but remember that 
I have more than Life at stake on your Fidelity. 
[$ (^Going.^) $]
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Then depend upon it, you have no Chance 
against you.
<P 27>
   [$ (^Myrt.^) $] Nay, no Ceremony, you know I must be 
going. [$ (^Exit^) Myrt.$]
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Well! this is another Instance of the
Perplexities which arise too, in faithful Friendship: We 
must often, in this Life, go on in our good 
Offices, even under the Displeasure of those to whom 
we do them, in Compassion to their Weaknesses and 
Mistakes -- But all this while poor (^Indiana^) is 
tortured with the Doubt of me! she has no Support or 
Comfort, but in my Fidelity, yet sees me daily press'd 
to Marriage with another! How painful, in such a 
Crisis, must be every Hour she thinks on me? I'll let 
her see, at least, my Conduct to her is not chang'd: 
I'll take this Opportunity to visit her; for tho' the 
Religious Vow, I have made to my Father, restrains 
me from ever marrying, without his Approbation, 
yet that confines me not from seeing a virtuous 
Woman, that is the pure Delight of my Eyes, and
the guiltless Joy of my Heart: But the best 
Condition of Human Life is but a gentler Misery.

   To hope for perfect Happiness is vain,
And Love has ever its Allays of Pain. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

[$ (^Enter^) Isabella, (^and^) Indiana (^in her own Lodgings^) .$]

   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Yes -- I say 'tis Artifice, dear Child; I say to
thee again and again, 'tis all Skill and Management.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Will you persuade me there can be an ill Design, 
in supporting me in the Condition of a Woman of 
Quality? attended, dress'd, and lodg'd like one; in 
my Appearance abroad, and my Furniture at home, 
every way in the most sumptuous manner, and he 
that does it has an Artifice, a Design in it?
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Yes, yes.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] And all this without so much as explaining to 
me, that all about me comes from him!
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Ay, ay, -- the more for that -- that keeps
the Title to all you have, the more in Him.
<P 28>
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] The more in Him! -- He scorns the 
Thought --
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Then He -- He -- He -- 
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Well, be not so eager. -- If he is an ill Man,
let us look into his Stratagems. Here is another of
them. [$ (^Shewing a Letter^) $] Here's two hundred and 
fifty Pound in Bank Notes, with these Words, 'To 
pay for the Set of Dressing-plate, which will be 
brought home To-morrow,' Why dear Aunt, now 
here's another Piece of Skill for you, which I own 
I cannot comprehend -- and it is with a bleeding 
Heart I hear you say any thing to the Disadvantage 
of Mr. (^Bevil^) . When he is present, I look upon him 
as one to whom I owe my Life, and the Support of 
it; Then again, as the Man who loves me with 
Sincerity and Honour. When his Eyes are cast another 
way, and I dare survey him, my Heart is painfully 
divided between Shame and Love -- Oh! cou'd I 
tell you: --
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Ah! You need not: I imagine all this for you.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] This is my State of Mind in his Presence; and
when he is absent, you are ever dinning my Ears with
Notions of the Arts of Men; that his hidden 
Bounty, his respectful Conduct, his careful Provision for me, 
after his preserving me from utmost Misery, are 
certain Signs he means nothing, but to make I know not 
what of me?
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Oh! You have a sweet Opinion of him, truly.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] I have, when I am with him, ten thousand
Things, besides my Sex's natural Decency and Shame,
to suppress my Heart, that yearns to thank, to praise,
to say it loves him: I say, thus it is with me while I
see him; and in his Absence I am entertain'd with
nothing but your Endeavours to tear this amiable 
Image from my Heart; and, in its stead, to place a base
Dissembler, an artful Invader of my Happiness, my
Innocence, my Honour.
<P 29>
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Ah poor Soul! has not his Plot taken? don't
you die for him? has not the way he has taken, been
the most proper with you? Oh! ho! He has Sense, 
and has judg'd the thing right.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Go on then, since nothing can answer you: 
say what you will of him. Heigh! ho!
   [$ (^Isab.^) $]  Heigh! ho! indeed. It is better to say so, as 
you are now, than as many others are. There are, 
among the Destroyers of Women, the Gentle, the 
Generous, the Mild, the Affable, the Humble, who 
all, soon after their Success in their Designs, turn to 
the contrary of those Characters. I will own to 
you, Mr. (^Bevil^) carries his Hypocrisie the best of any 
Man living, but still he is a Man, and therefore a 
Hypocrite. They have usurp'd an Exemption from 
Shame, for any Baseness, any Cruelty towards us. They 
embrace without Love; they make Vows, without
Conscience of Obligation; they are Partners, nay, 
Seducers to the Crime, wherein they pretend to be 
less guilty.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] That's truly observ'd. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
But what's all this to (^Bevil^) ?
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] This it is to (^Bevil^) , and all Mankind. Trust  #
not
those, who will think the worse of you for your 
Confidence in them. Serpents, who lie in wait for Doves.
Won't you be on your Guard against those who 
would betray you? Won't you doubt those who 
would contemn you for believing 'em? Take it from 
me: Fair and natural Dealing is to invite Injuries, 
'tis bleating to escape Wolves who would devour 
you! Such is the World, -- and such (since the 
Behaviour of one Man to my self) have I believ'd all the 
rest of the Sex. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] I will not doubt the Truth of (^Bevil^) , I will 
not doubt it; He has not spoke it by an Organ that 
is given to lying: His Eyes are all that have ever 
told me that he was mine: I know his Virtue, I know 
his filial Piety, and ought to trust his Management 
<P 30>
with a Father, to whom he has uncommon 
Obligations. What have I to be concern'd for? my Lesson 
is very short. If he takes me for ever, my purpose of 
Life is only to please him. If he leaves me (which 
Heaven avert) I know he'll do it nobly; and I shall 
have nothing to do but to learn to die, after worse 
than Death has happen'd to me.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Ay do, persist in your Credulity! flatter your
self that a Man of his Figure and Fortune will make
himself the Jest of the Town, and marry a 
handsome Beggar for Love.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] The Town! I must tell you, Madam, the 
Fools that laugh at Mr. (^Bevil^) , will but make 
themselves more ridiculous; his Actions are the Result of 
Thinking, and he has Sense enough to make even 
Virtue fashionable.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] O' my Conscience he has turn'd her Head --
Come, come; if he were the honest Fool you take 
him for, why has he kept you here these three 
Weeks, without sending you to (^Bristol^) , in search of 
your Father, your Family, and your Relations?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] I am convinc'd he still designs it; and that
nothing keeps him here, but the Necessity of not 
coming to a Breach with his Father, in regard to the 
Match he has propos'd him: Beside, has he not 
writ to (^Bristol^) ? and has not he Advice that my 
Father has not been heard of there, almost these twenty 
Years?
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] All Sham, meer Evasion; he is afraid, if he
should carry you thither, your honest Relations may
take you out of his hands, and so blow up all his 
wicked Hopes at once.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Wicked Hopes! did I ever give him any 
such?
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Has he ever given you any honest ones? can
you say, in your Conscience, he has ever once offer'd
to marry you?
<P 31>
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] No! but by his Behaviour I am convinc'd 
he will offer it, the Moment 'tis in his Power, or 
consistent with his Honour, to make such a Promise 
good to me.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] His Honour!
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] I will rely upon it; therefore desire you will
not make my Life uneasie, by these ungrateful 
Jealousies of one, to whom I am, and wish to be oblig'd:
For from his Integrity alone, I have resolv'd to hope
for Happiness.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Nay, I have done my Duty; if you won't see,
at your Peril be it --
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Let it be -- This is his hour of visiting 
me.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Oh! to be sure, keep up your Form; don't see
him in a Bed-chamber: This is pure Prudence, when
she is liable, where-ever he meets her, to be 
convey'd where-e'er he pleases. [$ (^Apart.^) $]
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] All the rest of my Life is but waiting 'till he
comes: I live only when I'm with him. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Well, go thy ways, thou willful Innocent! 
I once had almost as much Love for a Man, who 
poorly left me, to marry an Estate -- And I am now, 
against my Will, what they call an Old Maid -- 
but I will not let the Peevishness of that Condition 
grow upon me -- only keep up the Suspicion of it, 
to prevent this Creature's being any other than a 
Virgin, except upon proper Terms. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

[$ (^Re-enter^) Indiana (^speaking to a Servant^) .$]

   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Desire Mr. (^Bevil^) to walk in -- Design!
impossible! A base designing Mind could never think 
of what he hourly puts in practice -- And 
yet, since the late Rumour of his Marriage, he seems 
more reserv'd than formerly -- he sends in too, 
before he sees me, to know if I am at leisure -- such 
new Respect may cover Coldness in the Heart -- it 
<P 32>
certainly makes me thoughtful -- I'll know the 
worst, at once; I'll lay such fair Occasions in his way, 
that it shall be impossible to avoid an Explanation 
-- for these Doubts are insupportable! -- But see! 
he comes, and clears them all.

[$ (^Enter^) Bevil.$]

   [$ (^Bev.^) $] Madam, your most Obedient -- I am afraid
I broke in upon your Rest last Night -- 'twas very 
late before we parted; but 'twas your own Fault; I 
never saw you in such agreeable Humour.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] I am extremely glad we were both pleas'd; 
for I thought I never saw you better Company.
   [$ (^Bev.^) $] Me, Madam! you rally; I said very little.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] But, I am afraid, you heard me say a great 
deal; and when a Woman is in the talking Vein, the 
most agreeable thing a Man can do, you know, is to 
have Patience, to hear her.
   [$ (^Bev.^) $] Then it's pity, Madam, you should ever be
silent, that we might be always agreeable to one 
another.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] If I had your Talent, or Power, to make my
Actions speak for me, I might indeed be silent, and 
yet pretend to something more than the Agreeable.
   [$ (^Bev.^) $] If I might be vain of any thing, in my Power,
Madam, 'tis that my Understanding, from all your 
Sex, has mark'd you out, as the most deserving 
Object of my Esteem.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Should I think I deserve this, 'twere enough 
to make my Vanity forfeit the very Esteem you offer 
me.
   [$ (^Bev.^) $] How so, Madam?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Because Esteem is the Result of Reason, and 
to deserve it from good Sense, the Height of 
Human Glory: Nay, I had rather a Man of Honour 
should pay me that, than all the Homage of a sincere 
and humble Love.
<P 33>
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] You certainly distinguish right, Madam;
Love often kindles from external Merit only --
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] But Esteem arises from a higher Source, the
Merit of the Soul --
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] True -- And great Souls only can
deserve it. [$ (^Bowing respectfully.^) $]
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Now, I think, they are greater still, that can 
so charitably part with it.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Now, Madam, you make me vain, since
the utmost Pride, and Pleasure of my Life is, that I
esteem you -- as I ought.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] As he ought! still more           #
perplexing! 
he neither saves, nor kills my Hope.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] But Madam, we grow grave methinks -- 
Let's find some other Subject -- Pray how did you 
like the Opera last Night?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] First give me leave to thank you, for my 
Tickets.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] O! your Servant, Madam -- But pray 
tell me, you now, who are never partial to the Fashion, 
I fancy, must be the properest Judge of a mighty
Dispute among the Ladies, that is, whether (^Crispo^) or
(^Griselda^) is the more agreeable Entertainment.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] With submission now, I cannot be a proper
Judge of this Question.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] How so, Madam?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Because I find I have a Partiality for one of 
them.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Pray which is that?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] I do not know -- there's something in that
Rural Cottage of (^Griselda^) , her forlorn Condition, her
Poverty, her Solitude, her Resignation, her 
Innocent Slumbers, and that lulling (^ (\Dolce Sogno\) ^) that's 
sung over her; it had an Effect upon me, that -- in 
short I never was so well deceiv'd, at any of them.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Oh! Now then, I can account for the 
Dispute: (^Griselda^) , it seems, is the Distress of an 
injur'd Innocent Woman: (^Crispo^) , that only of a Man 
<P 34>
in the same Condition; therefore the Men are mostly
concern'd for (^Crispo^) , and, by a Natural Indulgence, 
both Sexes for (^Griselda^) .
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] So that Judgment, you think, ought to be 
for one, tho' Fancy and Complaisance have got 
ground for the other. Well! I believe you will 
never give me leave to dispute with you on any 
Subject; for I own, (^Crispo^) has its Charms for me too: 
Though in the main, all the Pleasure the best Opera 
gives us, is but meer Sensation. -- Methinks it's 
Pity the Mind can't have a little more Share in the 
Entertainment. -- The Musick's certainly fine; but, 
in my Thoughts, there's none of your Composers 
come up to Old (^Shakespear^) and (^Otway^) .
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] How, Madam! why if a Woman of your
Sense were to say this in the Drawing-Room --

[$ (^Enter a Servant.^) $]

   [$ (^Serv.^) $] Sir, here's Signior (^Carbonelli^) says he waits  
your Commands, in the next Room.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] (\A propos!\) You were saying Yesterday,
Madam, you had a mind to hear him -- will you give
him leave to entertain you now?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] By all means: desire the Gentleman to walk 
in. [$ (^Ex. Servant.^) $]
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $]  I fancy you will find something in this
Hand, that is uncommon.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] You are always finding ways, Mr. (^Bevil^) , to
make Life seem less tedious to me. --

[$ (^Enter Musick Master.^) $]

When the Gentleman pleases.

[$ (^After a Sonata is play'd^) , Bevil (^waits on the
Master to the Door^) , &c.$]

   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] You smile, Madam, to see me so
Complaisant to one, whom I pay for his Visit: Now, I 
<P 35>
own, I think it is not enough barely to pay those, 
whose Talents are superior to our own (I mean such 
Talents, as would become our Condition, if we had 
them.) Methinks we ought to do something more, 
than barely gratify them, for what they do at our 
Command, only because their Fortune is below us.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] You say I smile: I assure you it was a Smile of
Approbation; for indeed, I cannot but think it the
distinguishing part of a Gentleman, to make his
Superiority of Fortune as easy to his Inferiors, as he 
can. -- Now once more to try him. [$ (^Aside.^) $] -- 
I was saying just now, I believed you would never let 
me dispute with you, and I dare say, it will always 
be so: However I must have your Opinion upon a 
Subject, which created a Debate between my Aunt 
and me, just before you came hither; she would needs 
have it, that no Man ever does any extraordinary 
Kindness or Service for a Woman, but for his own 
sake.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Well Madam! Indeed I can't but be of 
her Mind.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] What, tho' he should maintain, and support
her, without demanding any thing of her, on her 
part?
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Why, Madam, is making an Expence, in 
the Service of a Valuable Woman (for such I must 
suppose her) though she should never do him any 
Favour, nay, though she should never know who did 
her such Service, such a mighty Heroick Business?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Certainly! I should think he must be a Man 
of an uncommon Mold.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Dear Madam, why so? 'tis but, at best, a
better Taste in Expence: To bestow upon one, whom
he may think one of the Ornaments of the whole
Creation, to be conscious, that from his Superfluity, 
an Innocent, a Virtuous Spirit is supported above the
Temptations and Sorrows of Life! That he sees 
Satisfaction, Health and Gladness in her Countenance,
<P 36> 
while he enjoys the Happiness of seeing her (as 
that I will suppose too, or he must be too 
abstracted, too insensible) I say, if he is allowed to 
delight in that Prospect; alas! what mighty 
matter is there, in all this?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] No mighty matter, in so disinterested a
Friendship!
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Disinterested! I can't think him so; your
Hero, Madam, is no more, than what every 
Gentleman ought to be, and I believe very many are -- 
He is only one, who takes more delight in 
Reflections, than in Sensations: He is more pleased with 
Thinking, than Eating; that's the utmost you can 
say of him -- Why, Madam, a greater Expence, 
than all this, Men lay out upon an unnecessary Stable 
of Horses.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Can you be sincere, in what you say?
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] You may depend upon it, if you know 
any such Man, he does not love Dogs inordinately.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] No, that he does not.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Nor Cards, nor Dice. 
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Nor Bottle Companions.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Nor loose Women.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] No, I'm sure he does not.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Take my Word then, if your admired 
Hero is not liable to any of these kind of Demands, 
there's no such Preheminence in this, as you 
imagine: Nay this way of Expence you speak of, is 
what exalts and raises him, that has a Taste for it: 
And, at the same time, his Delight is incapable of 
Satiety, Disgust, or Penitence.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] But still I insist his having no private Interest 
in the Action, makes it prodigious, almost 
Incredible.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Dear Madam, I never knew you more
mistaken: Why, who can be more an Usurer, than he,
<P 37>
who lays out his Money in such Valuable Purchases?
If Pleasure be worth purchasing, how great a Pleasure
is it to him, who has a true Taste of Life, to ease an
Aking Heart, to see the humane Countenance lighted
up, into Smiles of Joy, on the Receipt of a Bit of 
Oar, which is superfluous, and otherwise useless in a 
Man's own Pocket? What could a Man do better 
with his Cash? This is the Effect of an humane 
Disposition, where there is only a general Tye of Nature, 
and common Necessity. What then must it be, when 
we serve an Object of Merit, of Admiration!
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Well! the more you argue against it, the 
more I shall admire the Generosity.
   [$ (^Bev. jun.^) $] Nay, nay -- Then, Madam, 'tis time 
to fly, after a Declaration, that my Opinion 
strengthens my Adversary's Argument -- I had best 
hasten to my Appointment with Mr. (^Myrtle^) , and 
begone, while we are Friends, and -- before things are 
brought to an Extremity -- [$ (^Exit carelesly.^) $]

[$ (^Enter^) Isabella.$]

   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Well, Madam, what think you of him now
pray?
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] I protest, I begin to fear he is wholly
disinterested, in what he does for me. On my Heart, he 
has no other View, but the meer Pleasure of doing it, 
and has neither Good or Bad Designs upon me.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Ah! dear Neice! don't be in fear of both! 
I'll warrant you, you will know time enough, that 
he is not indifferent.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] You please me, when you tell me so: For, if
he has any Wishes towards me, I know he will not
pursue them, but with Honour.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] I wish, I were as confident of one, as t'other 
-- I saw the respectful Downcast of his Eye, when 
you catcht him gazing at you during the Musick: 
He, I warrant, was surpriz'd, as if he had been taken 
stealing your Watch. O! the undissembled Guilty 
Look!
<P 38>
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] But did you observe any such thing, Really? 
I thought he look'd most Charmingly Graceful! 
How engaging is Modesty, in a Man, when one 
knows there is a great Mind within -- So tender a 
Confusion! and yet, in other Respects, so much 
himself, so collected, so dauntless, so determin'd!
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Ah! Neice! there is a sort of Bashfulness,
which is the best Engine to carry on a shameless
Purpose: some Men's Modesty serves their 
Wickedness, as Hypocrisy gains the Respect due to Piety: But 
I will own to you, there is one hopeful Symptom, if 
there could be such a thing, as a disinterested Lover; 
But it's all a Perplexity, till -- till -- till -- 
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] Till what?
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Till I know whether Mr. (^Myrtle^) and Mr.         
(^Bevil^) are really Friends, or Foes -- And that I will 
be convinced of, before I sleep: For you shall not 
be deceiv'd.
   [$ (^Ind.^) $] I'm sure, I never shall, if your Fears can guard
me: In the mean time, I'll wrap my self up, in the
Integrity of my own Heart, nor dare to doubt of 
his.
   As Conscious Honour all his Actions steers;
So Conscious Innocence dispels my Fears. [$ (^ (\Ex.\) ^) $]

[}ACT III. SCENE I.}]

[$SCENE, (^Sealand's^) House.$]

[$ (^Enter^) Tom (^meeting^) Phillis.$]

   [$ (^Tom.^) $] Well, (^Phillis^) ! -- what, with a Face, as
if you had never seen me before -- 
What a Work have I to do now? She has seen some
new Visitant, at their House, whose Airs she has
catch'd, and is resolv'd to practise them upon me.
Numberless are the Changes she'll dance thro', before
she'll answer this plain Question; (^ (\videlicet\) ^) , Have you
deliver'd my Master's Letter to your Lady? Nay, I
know her too well, to ask an Account of it, in an
ordinary Way; I'll be in my Airs as well as she. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
-- Well, Madam, as unhappy as you are, at 
present, pleased to make me, I would not, in the 
general, be any other than what I am; I would not be 
a bit wiser, a bit richer, a bit taller, a bit shorter, 
than I am at this Instant. [$ (^Looking stedfastly at her.^) $]
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] Did ever any body doubt, Master (^Thomas^) , but
that you were extremely satisfied with your sweet 
self?
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] I am indeed -- The thing I have least 
reason to be satisfied with, is my Fortune, and I am glad 
of my Poverty; Perhaps, if I were rich, I should 
<P 40>
overlook the finest Woman in the World, that wants 
nothing but Riches, to be thought so.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] How prettily was that said? But, I'll have a 
great deal more, before I'll say one Word. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] I should, perhaps, have been stupidly above
her, had I not been her Equal; and by not being her
Equal, never had Opportunity of being her Slave. I
am my Master's Servant, for Hire; I am my Mistress's,
from Choice; wou'd she but approve my Passion.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] I think, it's the first Time I ever heard you
speak of it, with any Sense of the Anguish, if you really
do suffer any.
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] Ah! (^Philis^) , can you doubt, after what you 
have seen?
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] I know not what I have seen, nor what I
have heard; but since I'm at Leisure, you may tell
me, When you fell in Love with me; How you fell 
in Love with me; and what you have suffer'd, or are 
ready to suffer for me.
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] Oh! the unmerciful Jade! when I'm in haste
about my Master's Letter -- But, I must go thro' 
it. [$ (^Aside.^) $] -- Ah! too well I remember 
when, and how, and on what Occasion I was first 
surpriz'd. It was on the first of (^April^) , one thousand 
seven hundred and fifteen, I came into Mr. (^Sealand's^) 
Service; I was then a Hobble-de-Hoy, and you a 
pretty little tight Girl, a favourite Handmaid of the 
Housekeeper. -- At that Time, we neither of us 
knew what was in us: I remember, I was order'd to 
get out of the Window, one pair of Stairs, to rub the 
Sashes clean, -- the Person employ'd, on the 
innerside, was your Charming self, whom I had never 
seen before.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] I think, I remember the silly Accident: What
made ye, you Oaf, ready to fall down into the 
Street?
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] You know not, I warrant you -- You could
not guess what surpriz'd me. You took no Delight,
<P 41>
when you immediately grew wanton, in your 
Conquest, and put your Lips close, and breath'd upon 
the Glass, and when my Lips approach'd, a dirty 
Cloth you rubb'd against my Face, and hid your 
beauteous Form; when I again drew near, you spit, 
and rubb'd, and smil'd at my Undoing.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] What silly Thoughts you Men have!
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] We were (^Pyramus^) and (^Thisbe^) -- but ten 
times harder was my Fate; (^Pyramus^) could peep only 
through a Wall, I saw her, saw my (^Thisbe^) in all 
her Beauty, but as much kept from her as if a 
hundred Walls between, for there was more, there was 
her Will against me -- Would she but yet relent! 
-- Oh, (^Phillis^) ! (^Phillis^) ! shorten my Torment, and 
declare you pity me.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] I believe, it's very sufferable; the Pain is 
not so exquisite, but that you may bear it, a little 
longer.
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] Oh! my charming (^Phillis^) , if all depended 
on my Fair One's Will, I could with Glory suffer --
But, dearest Creature, consider our miserable State.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] How! Miserable!
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] We are miserable to be in Love, and under
the Command of others than those we love -- with
that generous Passion in the Heart, to be sent to 
and fro on Errands, call'd, check'd and rated for the 
meanest Trifles. Oh, (^Phillis^) ! you don't know how 
many (^China^) Cups, and Glasses, my Passion for you has 
made me break: You have broke my Fortune, as 
well as my Heart.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] Well, Mr. (^Thomas^) , I cannot but own to you,
that I believe, your Master writes and you speak the 
best of any Men in the World. Never was 
Woman so well pleas'd with a Letter, as my young 
Lady was with his, and this is an Answer to it.
[$ (^Gives him a Letter.^) $]
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] This was well done, my Dearest; consider,
we must strike out some pretty Livelyhood for our
<P 42>
selves, by closing their Affairs: It will be nothing for
them to give us a little Being of our own, some small
Tenement, out of their large Possessions: whatever 
they give us, 'twill be more than what they 
keep for themselves: one Acre, with (^Phillis^) , wou'd 
be worth a whole County without her.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] O, could I but believe you!
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] If not the Utterance, believe the Touch of 
my Lips. [$ (^Kisses her.^) $]
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] There's no contradicting you; how closely 
you argue, (^Tom^) !
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] And will closer, in due time. But I must 
hasten with this Letter, to hasten towards the 
Possession of you. -- Then, (^Phillis^) , consider, how I must 
be reveng'd, look to it, of all your Skittishness, shy 
Looks, and at best but coy Compliances.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] Oh! (^Tom^) , you grow wanton, and sensual, as
my Lady calls it, I must not endure it; Oh! Foh!
you are a Man, an odious filthy Male Creature; you
should behave, if you had a right Sense, or were a 
Man of Sense, like Mr. (^Cimberton^) , with Distance,
and Indifference; or let me see some other becoming 
hard Word, with seeming in-in-inadvertency, and 
not rush on one as if you were seizing a Prey. But 
Hush -- the Ladies are coming -- God (^Tom^) , don't 
kiss me above once, and be gone -- Lard, we have 
been Fooling and Toying, and not consider'd the 
main Business of our Masters and Mistresses.
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] Why, their Business is to be Fooling and 
Toying, as soon as the Parchments are ready.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] Well remember'd -- Parchments -- my 
Lady, to my Knowledge, is preparing Writings 
between her Coxcomb Cousin (^Cimberton^) , and my 
Mistress; though my Master has an Eye to the 
Parchments already prepar'd between your Master Mr. (^Bevil^) , 
and my Mistress; and I believe, my Mistress herself 
has sign'd, and seal'd, in her Heart, to Mr. (^Myrtle^) . 
-- Did I not bid you kiss me but once, and be gone? 
but I know you won't be satisfy'd.
<P 43>
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] No, you smooth Creature, how should I!
[$ (^Kissing her Hand.^) $]
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] Well, since you are so humble, or so cool,
as to ravish my Hand only, I'll take my Leave of you
like a great Lady, and you a Man of Quality.
[$ (^They Salute formally.^) $]
   [$ (^Tom.^) $] Pox of all this State. 
[$ (^Offers to kiss her more closely.^) $]
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] No, pr'ythee, (^Tom^) , mind your Business. We 
must follow that Interest which will take; but 
endeavour at that which will be most for us, and we like 
most -- O here's my young Mistress! [$Tom (^taps 
her Neck behind, and kisses his Fingers^) .$] Go, ye 
liquorish Fool. [$ (^Exit^) Tom.$]

[$ (^Enter^) Lucinda.$]

   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Who was that you was hurrying away?
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] One that I had no mind to part with.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Why did you turn him away then?
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] For your Ladyship's Service, to carry your
Ladyship's Letter to his Master: I could hardly get 
the Rogue away.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Why, has he so little Love for his Master?
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] No; but he has so much Love for his 
Mistress.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] But, I thought, I heard him kiss you. Why 
do you suffer that?
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] Why, Madam, we Vulgar take it to be a 
Sign of Love; we Servants, we poor People, that 
have nothing but our Persons to bestow, or treat for, 
are forc'd to deal, and bargain by way of Sample; 
and therefore, as we have no Parchments, or Wax 
necessary in our Agreements, we squeeze with our 
Hands, and seal with our Lips, to ratifie Vows and 
Promises.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] But can't you trust one another, without such
Earnest down?
<P 44>
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] We don't think it safe, any more than you
Gentry, to come together without Deeds executed.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Thou art a pert merry Hussy.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] I wish, Madam, your Lover and you were 
as happy, as (^Tom^) and your Servant are.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] You grow impertinent.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] I have done, Madam; and I won't ask you,
what you intend to do with Mr. (^Myrtle^) , what your
Father will do with Mr. (^Bevil^) , nor what you all, 
especially my Lady, mean by admitting Mr. 
(^Cimberton^) as particularly here, as if he were married to you 
already; nay, you are married actually as far as 
People of Quality are.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] How's that?
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] You have different Beds in the same House.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Pshaw! I have a very great Value for Mr. 
(^Bevil^) , but have absolutely put an End to his 
Pretensions, in the Letter I gave you for him: But, my 
Father, in his Heart, still has a mind to him, were it 
not for this Woman they talk of; and, I am apt to 
imagine he is married to her, or never designs to 
marry at all.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] Then Mr. (^Myrtle^) --
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] He had my Parents Leave to apply to me, and 
by that he has won me, and my Affections: who is to 
have this Body of mine, without 'em, it seems, is 
nothing to me; my Mother says, it's indecent for me 
to let my Thoughts stray about the Person of my 
Husband: nay, she says, a Maid, rigidly Virtuous, tho' 
she may have been where her Lover was a thousand 
times, should not have made Observations enough, to 
know him from another Man, when she sees him in 
a third Place.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] That is more than the Severity of a Nun, for 
not to see, when one may, is hardly possible; not to 
see when one can't, is very easy: at this rate, Madam, 
there are a great many whom you have not seen 
who -- 
<P 45>
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Mamma says, the first time you see your
Husband should be at that Instant he is made so; when 
your Father, with the help of the Minister, gives 
you to him; then you are to see him; then you are 
to Observe and take Notice of him, because then 
you are to Obey him.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] But does not my Lady remember, you are to
Love, as well as Obey?
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] To Love is a Passion, 'tis a Desire, and we 
must have no Desires. Oh! I cannot endure the 
Reflection! With what Insensibility on my Part, with 
what more than Patience, have I been expos'd, and 
offer'd to some aukward Booby or other, in every 
County of (^Great Britain^) ?
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] Indeed, Madam, I wonder, I never heard 
you speak of it before, with this Indignation.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Every Corner of the Land has presented me
with a wealthy Coxcomb. As fast as one Treaty has 
gone off, another has come on, 'till my Name and 
Person have been the Tittle Tattle of the whole 
Town: What is this World come to! No Shame 
left! To be barter'd for, like the Beasts of the Fields, 
and that, in such an Instance, as coming together, to 
an intire Familiarity, and Union of Soul and Body; 
Oh! and this, without being so much as 
Well-wishers to each other, but for encrease of Fortune.
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] But, Madam, all these Vexations will end, 
very soon, in one for all: Mr. (^Cimberton^) is your 
Mother's Kinsman, and three hundred Years an older 
Gentleman than any Lover you ever had; for which
Reason, with that of his prodigious large Estate, she 
is resolved on him, and has sent to consult the 
Lawyers accordingly. Nay, has (whether you know it 
or no) been in Treaty with Sir (^Geoffry^) , who, to join 
in the Settlement, has accepted of a Sum to do it, 
and is every Moment expected in Town for that 
Purpose.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] How do you get all this Intelligence?
<P 46>
   [$ (^Phil.^) $] By an Art I have, I thank my Stars, beyond
all the Waiting-maids in (^Great Britain^) ; the Art of
List'ning, Madam, for your Ladyship's Service.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] I shall soon know as much as you do; leave
me, leave me, (^Phillis^) , be gone: Here, here, I'll 
turn you out. My Mother says I must not converse 
with my Servants; tho' I must converse with no one 
else. [$ (^Exit^) Phillis.$] How unhappy are we, who are 
born to great Fortunes! No one looks at us, with 
Indifference, or acts towards us on the Foot of Plain 
Dealing; yet, by all I have been heretofore offer'd 
to, or treated for, I have been us'd with the most 
agreeable of all Abuses, Flattery; but now, by this 
Flegmatick Fool, I am us'd as nothing, or a meer 
Thing; He, forsooth! is too wise, too learned 
to have any regard to Desires, and, I know not 
what the learned Oaf calls Sentiments of Love and 
Passion -- Here he comes with my Mother -- 
It's much if he looks at me; or if he does, takes no 
more Notice of me, than of any other Moveable in 
the Room.

[$ (^Enter Mrs.^) Sealand, (^and Mr.^) Cimberton.$]

   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] How do I admire this noble, this learned
Taste of yours, and the worthy Regard you have to
our own ancient and honourable House, in consulting 
a Means, to keep the Blood as pure, and as regularly
descended as may be.
   [$ (^Cim.^) $] Why, really Madam, the young Women of 
this Age are treated with Discourses of such a 
Tendency, and their Imaginations so bewilder'd in Flesh 
and Blood, that a Man of Reason can't talk to be 
understood: They have no Ideas of Happiness, but 
what are more gross than the Gratification of Hunger 
and Thirst.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] With how much Reflection he is a 
Coxcomb? [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Cim.^) $] And in Truth, Madam, I have consider'd it,
<P 47>
as a most brutal Custom, that Persons, of the first
Character in the World, should go as ordinarily, and 
with as little Shame, to Bed, as to Dinner with one 
another. They proceed to the Propagation of the 
Species, as openly, as to the Preservation of the 
Individual.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] She that willingly goes to Bed to thee, must
have no Shame, I'm sure. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] Oh Cousin (^Cimberton^) ! Cousin             #
(^Cimberton^) !
how abstracted, how refin'd, is your Sense of Things! 
But, indeed, it is too true, there is nothing so 
ordinary as to say, in the best govern'd Families, my 
Master and Lady are gone to Bed; one does not know 
but it might have been said of one's self.
[$ (^Hiding her Face with her Fan.^) $]
   [$ (^Cim.^) $] (^Lycurgus^) , Madam, instituted otherwise; among
the (^Lacedemonians^) , the whole Female World was
pregnant, but none, but the Mothers themselves, 
knew by whom; their Meetings were secret, and 
the Amorous Congress always by Stealth; and no such 
professed Doings between the Sexes, as are tolerated 
among us, under the audacious Word, Marriage.
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] Oh! had I liv'd, in those Days, and 
been a Matron of (^Sparta^) , one might, with less 
Indecency, have had ten Children, according to that 
modest Institution, than one, under the Confusion of our 
modern, barefac'd manner.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] And yet, poor Woman, she has gone thro' 
the whole Ceremony, and here I stand a melancholy 
Proof of it. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] We will talk then of Business. That 
Girl walking about the Room there is to be your 
Wife. She has, I confess, no Ideas, no Sentiments, 
that speak her born of a thinking Mother.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] I have observ'd her; her lively Look, free
Air, and disengag'd Countenance speak her very --
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Very, What?
<P 48>
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] If you please, Madam -- to set her a little
that way.
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] (^Lucinda^) , say nothing to him, you are 
not a Match for him; when you are married, you 
may speak to such a Husband, when you're spoken to. 
But, I am disposing of you, above your self, every 
way.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] Madam, you cannot but observe the 
Inconveniences I expose my self to, in hopes that your
Ladyship will be the Consort of my better Part: As for 
the young Woman, she is rather an Impediment, 
than a Help, to a Man of Letters and Speculation. 
Madam, there is no Reflection, no Philosophy, can, 
at all times, subdue the Sensitive Life, but the 
Animal shall sometimes carry away the Man: Ha! ay, 
the Vermilion of her Lips.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Pray, don't talk of me thus.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] The pretty enough -- Pant of her Bosom.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Sir; Madam, don't you hear him?
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] Her forward Chest.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Intollerable!
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] High Health.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] The grave, easy Impudence of him!
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] Proud Heart.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Stupid Coxcomb!
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] I say, Madam, her Impatience, while we are
looking at her, throws out all Attractions -- her Arms
-- her Neck -- what a Spring in her Step!
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Don't you run me over thus, you strange
Unaccountable!
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] What an Elasticity in her Veins and 
Arteries!
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] I have no Veins, no Arteries.
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] Oh, Child, hear him, he talks finely, 
he's a Scholar, he knows what you have.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] The speaking Invitation of her Shape, the
Gathering of her self up, and the Indignation you 
see in the pretty little thing -- now, I am 
<P 49>
considering her, on this Occasion, but as one that is to be 
pregnant.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] The familiar, learned, unseasonable Puppy!
[$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] And pregnant undoubtedly she will be 
yearly. I fear, I shan't, for many Years, have 
Discretion enough to give her one fallow Season.
   [$ (^Luc.^) $] Monster! there's no bearing it. The hideous
Sot! -- there's no enduring it, to be thus survey'd 
like a Steed at Sale.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] At Sale! she's very illiterate -- But she's 
very well limb'd too; turn her in; I see what she is.
[$ (^Exit^) Lucinda (^in a Rage^) .$]
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] Go, you Creature, I am asham'd of you.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] No harm done -- you know, Madam, the 
better sort of People, as I observ'd to you, treat by 
their Lawyers of Weddings [$ (^adjusting himself at the 
Glass^) $] and the Woman in the Bargain, like the 
Mansion-House in the Sale of the Estate, is thrown in, 
and what that is, whether good or bad, is not at all 
consider'd.
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] I grant it, and therefore make no 
Demand for her Youth, and Beauty, and every other 
Accomplishment, as the common World think 'em, 
because she is not Polite.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] Madam, I know, your exalted 
Understanding, abstracted, as it is, from vulgar Prejudices, will 
not be offended, when I declare to you, I Marry to 
have an Heir to my Estate, and not to beget a Colony, 
or a Plantation: This young Woman's Beauty, and 
Constitution, will demand Provision for a tenth Child 
at least.
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] With all that Wit, and Learning, how
considerate! What an Oeconomist! [$ (^aside.^) $] -- Sir, I
cannot make her any other than she is; or say she is
much better than the other young Women of this 
Age, or fit for much, besides being a Mother; but I 
have given Directions for the Marriage Settlements,
<P 50> 
and Sir (^Geoffrey Cimberton's^) Council is to meet ours 
here, at this Hour, concerning his joyning in the 
Deed, which when executed, makes you capable of 
settling what is due to (^Lucinda's^)  Fortune: Her self, 
as I told you, I say nothing of.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] No, no, no, indeed, Madam, it is not usual,
and I must depend upon my own Reflection, and 
Philosophy, not to overstock my Family.
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] I cannot help her, Cousin (^Cimberton^) ; but
she is, for ought I see, as well as the Daughter of 
any body else.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] That is very true, Madam.

[$ (^Enter a Servant, who whispers Mrs.^) Sealand.$]

   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] The Lawyers are come, and now we 
are to hear what they have resolv'd as to the point 
whether it's necessary that Sir (^Geoffry^) should join in 
the Settlement, as being what they call in the 
Remainder. But, good Cousin, you must have Patience with 
'em. These Lawyers, I am told, are of a different 
kind, one is what they call a Chamber-Council, the 
other a Pleader: The Conveyancer is slow, from an 
Imperfection in his Speech, and therefore shun'd the 
Bar, but extremely Passionate, and impatient of 
Contradiction: The other is as warm as he; but has a 
Tongue so voluble, and a Head so conceited, he will 
suffer no body to speak but himself.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] You mean old Serjeant (^Target^) , and 
Counsellor (^Bramble^) ? I have heard of 'em.
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] The same: shew in the Gentlemen.
[$ (^Exit Servant.^) $]

[$ (^Re-enter Servant, introducing^) Myrtle (^and^) Tom,
(^disguis'd as^) Bramble (^and^) Target.$]

   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] Gentlemen, this is the Party concern'd,
Mr. (^Cimberton^) ; and I hope you have consider'd of the
matter.
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] Yes, Madam, we have agreed that it must be
by Indent-dent-dent-dent-
<P 51>
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] Yes, Madam, Mr. Serjeant and my self have
agreed, as he is pleas'd to inform you, that it must be
an Indenture Tripartite, and Tripartite let it be, for 
Sir (^Geoffry^) must needs be a Party; old (^Cimberton^) , in 
the Year 1619, says, in that ancient Roll, in Mr. 
Serjeant's Hands, as recourse thereto being had, will 
more at large appear --
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] Yes, and by the Deeds in your Hands, it
appears, that -- 
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] Mr. Serjeant, I beg of you to make no
Inferences upon what is in our Custody; but speak to 
the Titles in your own Deeds -- I shall not show 
that Deed till my Client is in Town.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] You know best your own Methods.
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] The single Question is, whether the
Intail is such, that my Cousin Sir (^Geoffry^) is necessary in
this Affair?
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] Yes, as to the Lordship of (^Tretriplet^) , but not
as to the Messuage of (^Grimgribber^) .
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] I say that (^Gr-gr-^) that (^Gr-gr-Grimgribber,
Grimgribber^) is in us. That is to say the remainder
thereof, as well as that of (^Tr-tr-Triplet^) .
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] You go upon the Deed of Sir (^Ralph^) , made 
in the middle of the last Century, precedent to that
in which old (^Cimberton^) made over the Remainder, 
and made it pass to the Heirs general, by which your 
Client comes in; and I question whether the 
Remainder even of (^Tretriplet^) is in him -- But we are willing 
to wave that, and give him a valuable Consideration. 
But we shall not purchase what is in us for ever, as 
(^Grimgribber^) is, at the rate as we guard against the 
Contingent of Mr. (^Cimberton^) having no Son -- 
Then we know Sir (^Geoffry^) is the first of the 
Collateral Male Line in this Family -- Yet --
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] Sir, (^Gr-gr-ber^) is --
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] I apprehend you very well, and your
Argument might be of Force, and we would be inclin'd 
to hear that in all its Parts -- But, Sir, I see very 
<P 52>
plainly what you are going into -- I tell you, it is as 
probable a Contingent that Sir (^Geoffry^) may die before 
Mr. (^Cimberton^) , as that he may outlive him.
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] Sir, we are not ripe for that yet, but I must 
say --
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] Sir, I allow you the whole extent of that
Argument; but that will go no farther than as to the
Claimants under old (^Cimberton^) , -- I am of Opinion, 
that according to the Instruction of Sir (^Ralph^) , he 
could not dock the Entail, and then create a new 
Estate for the Heirs General.
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] Sir, I have not patience to be told that, when
(^Gr-gr-ber--^)
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] I will allow it you, Mr Serjeant; but there
must be the word Heirs for ever, to make such an
Estate as you pretend.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] I must be impartial, tho' you are Council for my
side of the Question -- Were it not that you are so
good as to allow him what he has not said, I should 
think it very hard you should answer him without 
hearing him -- But Gentlemen, I believe you have both 
consider'd this matter, and are firm in your different 
Opinions: 'Twere better therefore you proceeded 
according to the particular Sense of each of you, and 
gave your Thoughts distinctly in Writing -- And do 
you see, Sirs, pray let me have a Copy of what you 
say, in (^English^) .
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] Why, what is all we have been saying? --
In (^English^) ! Oh! but I forgot my self, you're a Wit --
But however, to please you, Sir, you shall have it, 
in as plain terms, as the Law will admit of.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] But I would have it, Sir, without delay.
   [$ (^Bram.^) $] That, Sir, the Law will not admit of: the
Courts are sitting at (^Westminster^) , and I am this 
moment oblig'd to be at every one of them, and t'would 
be wrong if I should not be in the Hall to attend one 
of 'em at least, the rest would take it ill else -- 
Therefore, I must leave what I have said to Mr. 
<P 53>
Serjeant's Consideration, and I will digest his 
Arguments on my part, and you shall hear from me again, 
Sir. [$ (^Exit^) Bramble.$]
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] Agreed, agreed.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] Mr. (^Bramble^) is very quick -- He parted a
little abruptly.
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] He could not bear my Argument, I pincht 
him to the quick about that (^Gr-gr-ber^) .
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] I saw that, for he durst not so much as
hear you -- I shall send to you, Mr. Serjeant, as soon
as Sir (^Geoffry^) comes to Town, and then I hope all 
may be adjusted.
   [$ (^Tar.^) $] I shall be at my Chambers, at my usual Hours.
[$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] Madam, if you please, I'll now attend you to
the Tea-Table, where I shall hear from your
Ladyship, Reason, and good Sense, after all this Law and 
Gibberish. 
   [$ (^Mrs. Seal.^) $] 'Tis a wonderful thing, Sir, that Men of
Professions do not study to talk the Substance of what
they have to say, in the Language of the rest of the
World: Sure, they'd find their Account in it.
   [$ (^Cimb.^) $] They might, perhaps, Madam, with People
of your good Sense; but, with the generality 'twould
never do: The Vulgar would have no respect for 
Truth and Knowledge, if they were exposed to naked 
View.
   Truth is too simple, of all Art bereav'd:
Since the World will -- why let it be deceiv'd.                      #
