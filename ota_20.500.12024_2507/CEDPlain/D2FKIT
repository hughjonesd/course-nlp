[}THE FISHWIFES TALE OF (^BRAINFORD^) .}]

[^A SUMPTER MAN FROM WINDSOR SO FEARED THAT HIS WIFE WOULD MAKE HIM A
CUCKOLD THAT HE "RESTRAINED HER LIBERTY", BUT THIS ONLY MADE
HIS WIFE DISLIKE HIM. REALISING HIS MISTAKE, HE TRIED TO BE MORE 
LENIENT AND KINDLY TOWARD HER.^]     
[^...^] [$The
morning being come that he was to depart from home (after many
sweet kisses, and kinde imbraces giuen by him) hee said:$] Sweet
honey, I cannot blame thee, that thou takest my vsage heretofore
vnkindly: but if thou knewest (as I meane to shew thee) what my 
intent was, thou wilt change that bad thought for a better liking of
me. Know then, my loue, that I vsed thee thus strangely, to know
how deepe thy loue was settled on me: for to vse a friend 
frowardly, tryes her loue, in forbearance of his iniuries: and      #
in seeking to
please him) which I haue found by proofe immoueable. Oh my
more then deare wife, thy loue is fixed sure on me, and not to be
remoued by any crosse whatsoeuer. [^...^]
<P B2R>
[^THE WIFE WAS NOW DETERMINED TO CUCKOLD HER HUSBAND: WHEN HE WENT 
AWAY ON BUSINESS, SHE ARRANGED A MEETING WITH AN ADMIRER VIA A WOMAN 
FROM THE TOWN. ALTHOUGH THE WOMAN WAS INSTRUCTED TO LET HER KNOW IF 
HER HUSBAND RETURNED EARLY, SHE RETURNED TO FIND HER SUSPICIOUS
HUSBAND ALREADY AT HOME.^]
[^---^] Thou Whore,
long time haue I doubted this loosenes in thy life, which I now
haue plaine proofe of by thy gadding in my absence, and doe thou at
this present looke for no other thing at my hands, then reward fit
for so vilde a creature as a Whore is. [^...^]
[^THE SUMPTER MAN THREATENED TO HURT HIS WIFE IF SHE SPOKE ONE WORD. 
HE THEN TIED HER TO A POST BY THE DOOR BEFORE GOING TO BED. SOME TIME
LATER, THE WOMAN ARRIVED.^]
[^---^] [$but as she passed by, the poore
woman that was bound to her good behauiour, call'd her by her name
(yet very softly) saying,$] Mother (^Ione^) , I am heere, mother     #
(^Ione^) , pray
goe no furder, and speake softly: for my Husband, mother (^Ione^) ,  #
is a
bed. [$This good old Woman went to her, and finding her bound,
asked her the cause: to whom the afflicted Wife related (with still
speech, which is contrary to womens nature) euery circumstance,
for she knew her Husband fast enough for three houres.$] Is that all,
[$said the old Woman?$] then feare not but you shal enioy your       #
friends
bed: [$with that she vnloosed her. The Sumpter-mans wife
maruelled what she meant to doe, saying,$] Mother, what meane you?   #
this is
not the way that I must take to cleere my selfe. Alas, should he wake
and finde me gone to morrow, he will kill mee in his rage. Content
you, [$said the old Wife,$] I will bide the brunt of all: and heere  #
will
<P B2V>
I stand tyed to this post till you returne, which I pray let be so   #
soone
as you can. [$This wanton Wife praised her counsell, and imbraces
the same, and leauing the old Woman bound (as she desired) in her
place, she went to her lusty Louer, who long time had expected her:
to whom she related her husbands vnluckie comming home, her ill
vsage, and the old Womans kindnesse: for all which he was sorrie,
but could not mend, onely hee promised to reward this kinde
woman, call'd Mother (^Ione^) : so leauing that talke they fell to   #
other.$]
   [$The Sumpter-man, who could not soundly sleepe, because still he
dreamed of Hornes and Cuckolds, wakened not long after his wife
was gone: and being wakened, he fell to talking after this manner:$]
Now you queane, is it good gadding? Is your hote bloud cooled
yet with the cold ayre? Will your insatiable desires be allayed with
hunger and cold? if they be not, thou arrant Whore, I will tye thee
thus vp, not onely nine dayes, but nineteene times nine dayes,
till thou hast lost this hote and damnable pride of thine: I'le      #
doo't,
Whore, I will, I sweare I will. [$This good old Woman hearing
him rayle thus frantickly, wished (with all her heart) her selfe out
of doores, and his Wife in her old place. Shee durst not speake to
him, for feare she should be knowne by her speech to bee another,
and not his Wife: and hee lay still calling to her, asking if her    #
hote
desires were cooled. At length hee hearing her make no answere,
thought her to be sullen: and bid her speak to him, or else she      #
should
repent it: (yet durst not the old wife speake.) He hearing no speech,
rose vp, and tooke his knife, swearing hee would marke her for a
Whore, and with those words he ranne to her, and cut her ouer the
nose: all this the old Woman indured quietly, knowing her words
would haue but increased her punishment. To bed went he againe,
with such words as hee vsed before, saying, that since her bloud
would not coole, he would let it out. Hauing lyen a while, he fell
asleepe, leauing the old (^Ione^) bleeding at nose, where shee stood #
till three
of the clocke in the morning: at which time this honest Lasse (the
Sumpter-mans wife) came home: when she had quietly opened the
doore, she went to the old Woman, asking her how she had sped:$]
Marry, [$quoth she,$] as I would with my enemies to speed, ill: I pray
vnbinde me, or I shall bleed to death. [$The good wife was sorry to
heare that she had receiued such hurt, but farre gladder that it did
not happen vnto her selfe: so vnbinding her, she stood in her place.$]
<P B3R>
[^THE CLEVER OLD WOMAN DEVISED A SCHEME WHEREBY HER HUSBAND BELIEVED 
HE HAD CUT HIS WIFE'S NOSE WHILE REACHING FOR HIS TOOLS IN THE EARLY 
MORNING LIGHT.^] 
[^...^] [$The Sumpter-man all this while did little thinke
how he was beguiled: who when he was awaked, lighted a
Candle to see what hurt he had dane his Wife in his rage: he comming
neere her, and seeing her face whole, stood in a maze, not knowing
what to thinke on it, for he was sure that he had cut her nose. His
Wife seeing him stand in this maner, asked him what he did ayle, &
why he gazed so on her as though he knew her not?$] Pardon mee,
Wife, [$quoth he,$] for this night hath a miracle beene wrought: I doe
see plainely that the heauens will not suffer the Innocent to suffer
harme. [$Then fetched hee his knife which was all bloudy, saying,$]
Deare Wife, with this knife did I giue thee this present night, a
wound on the face, the which most miraculously is whole: which is
a signe thou art free, and spotlesse, and so will I euer hold thee.  #
[$His
Wife said little (for feare of laughing) onely shee said, she knew
heauen would defend the Innocent: so they went to bed louingly
together, he vowing neuer to thinke amisse on her. So had she more
libertie then before, & the old had gold for her wound, which wound
was so well cured (I thanke God) that you can scarce see it on my
nose.$] [^...^]

[^DESCRIPTION OMITTED.^]

[}HER TALE.}]

<P B4R>
[^A GENTLEMAN OF WALTAM HAD A BEAUTIFUL WIFE, WHOM HE LOVED GREATLY. 
BUT, AFTER CONVERSING WITH SOME GENTLEMEN IN AN INN IN LONDON, HIS 
LOVE QUICKLY TURNED TO HATE.^]
[^...^] [$Amongst other talke at table,
one tooke occasion to speake of women, and what excellent
creatures they were, so long as they continued loyall to man. To whom
answered one, saying:$] This is truth, Sir: so is the Diuell good so
long as he doth no harme, which is meaner: his goodnes and
womens loyaltie will come both in one yeere, but it is so farre off, #
that     
none in this age shall liue to see it.
   [$This Gentleman louing his Wife dearely (and knowing her
to be free from this vnciuill Gentlemans generall taxation of
women) in her behalfe, said:$] Sir, you are too bitter against the sexe
of women, and doe ill (for some ones sake that hath proued false to
you) to taxe the generalitie of women-kinde with lightnesse: and
but I would not be counted vnciuill amongst these Gentlemen, I
would giue you the reply that approued vntruth deserueth, you
know my meaning, Sir: construe my words as you please: excuse
me, Gentlemen, if I be vnciuill: I answere in the behalfe of one,
who is as free from disloyaltie, as is the Sunne from darknes, or
the fire from cold. Pray, Sir, [$said the other,$] since wee are     #
opposite
in opinions, let vs rather talke like Lawyers, that wee may bee
quickly friends againe, then like Souldiers which end their words
with blowes. Perhaps this woman that you answere for, is chaste,
but yet against her will: for many women are honest, 'cause they
haue not the meanes, and opportunitie to bee dis-honest (so is a
Thiefe true in prison, 'cause he hath nothing to steale:) had I but
opportunitie, and knew this same Saint you so adore, I would
pawne my life and whole estate, in a short while to bring you some
manifest token of her disloyaltie. Sir, you are yong in the
knowledge of womens slights, your want of experience makes you too
credulous: therefore be not abused. [$This speech of his made the
Gentleman more out of patience then before, so that with much
<P B4V>
adoe he held himselfe from offering violence: but his anger beeing
a little ouer, hee said,$] Sir, I doe verily beleeue, that this vaine
speech of yours proceedeth rather from a loose end ill manner'd
minde, then of any experience you haue had of womens loosenes:
and since you thinke your selfe so cunning in that (diuellish art) of
corrupting womens chastitie, I will lay downe heere a hundred
pounds, against which you shall lay fifty pounds, and before these
Gentlemen I promise you, if that within a moneths space you
bring me any token of this Gentlewomans disloyaltie (for whose
sake I haue spoken in the behalfe of all women) I doe freely giue
you leaue to inioy the same: conditionally you not performing it,
I may enioy your money. If that it be a match, speake, and I will
acquaint you where she dwelleth: and besides, I vow, as I am a
Gentleman, not to giue her notice of any such intent that is
toward her. Sir, [$quoth the man,$] your proffer is faire, and I     #
accept
the same: [^---^]
[^AFTER THE WAGER WAS AGREED, THE GENTLEMEN RETIRED FOR THE EVENING. 
THE NEXT DAY, THE YOUNG MAN RODE TO WALTAM. HE FOUND THE LADY IN 
QUESTION IN A FIELD, AND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO HER AND KISSED HER.^]
[^---^] [$after his salutation, he said,$] Gentlewoman, I pray
pardon me if I haue beene too bold, I was intreated by your 
Husband which is at London (I riding this way) to come and see you,
by me he hath sent his commends to you, with a kinde intreat that
you would not be discontented for his long absence, it being serious
businesse that keepes him from your sight. [$The Gentlewoman
very modestly bade him welcome, thanking him for his kindnes, 
withall telling him that her Husband might command her patience so
long as he pleased. Then intreated shee him to walke homeward,
where shee gaue him such entertainment as was fit for a
Gentleman, one her husbands friend.$] [^...^]
<P C1R>
[^THE LADY ENTERTAINED HER GUEST, BUT WOULD NOT ALLOW HERSELF TO BE
ALONE WITH HIM. THE YOUNG MAN THUS HAD TO SNEAK INTO HER BEDROOM
ONE NIGHT AND STEAL HER GOLD CRUCIFIX FROM HER DRESSING TABLE AS SHE
SLEPT. THE NEXT MORNING HE RETURNED TO THE INN IN LONDON TO SPEAK 
WITH THE LADY'S HUSBAND.^]
<P C1V>
[^---^] [$he said in this manner:$] Sir, did not I tell
you that you were too yong in experience of womans subtilties, and
that no woman was longer good then she had cause, or time to doe
ill? this you beleeued not, and thought it a thing so vnlikely, that
you haue giuen me a hundred pounds for the knowledge of it. In
briefe, know, your Wife is a woman, and therefore a wanton, a
changeling: to confirme that I speake, see heere (shewing him the
Crucifix:) know you this? if this be not sufficient proofe, I wil    #
fetch
you more.
[^WHEN THE GENTLEMAN OF WALTAM SAW THE CRUCIFIX THAT HIS WIFE USUALLY
WORE CLOSE TO HER HEART HE WAS DEVASTATED, BUT HE PAID THE WAGER. 
AFTER CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE FOR A TIME, HE RESOLVED TO KILL HIS 
CHEATING WIFE.^]
[^...^] [$To this intent he
<P C2R>
called his man, to whom he said;$] (^George^) , thou knowest I haue  #
euer
held thee deare, making more account of thee, then thy other 
fellowes, and thou hast often told me that thou diddest owe thy life
to
me, which at any time thou wouldest bee ready to render vp to doe
me good. True Sir, [$ (answered his man) $] I said no more there, then
I will now at any time, whensoeuer you please, performe. I beleeue
thee, (^George^) (replyed he:) but there is no such need: I onely    #
would
haue thee doe a thing for me, in which is no great danger, yet the
profit which thou shalt haue thereby shall amount to my wealth: for
the loue that thou bearest to me, and for thy own good wilt thou do
this? Sir (answered (^George^) ) more for your loue, then any reward,
I will doe it, (and yet money makes many men valiant) pray tell
mee what it is? (^George^) [$ (said his Master) $] this it is, thou  #
must
goe home, praying thy Mistris to meete me halfe the way to
London: but hauing her by the way, is some priuate place kill her: I
meane as I speake, kill her, I say, this is my command, which thou
hast promised to performe: which if thou performest not, I vow to
kill thee the next time thou commest in my sight. Now for thy
reward it shall be this, Take my Ring, and when thou hast done my
command: by vertue of it, doe thou assume my place till my returne,
at which time thou shalt know what my reward is, till then gouern
my whole estate: and for thy Mistris absence, & my own, make what
excuse thou plase: so be gone. Well Sir [$ (said (^George^) ) $]     #
since it is
your will, though vnwilling I am to doe it, yet I will performe it.
[$So went he his way toward Waltam: and his Master presently rid
to the Court, where hee abode with King (^Henry^) , who a little
before was inlarged by the Earle of Warwicke, and placed in the
Throne againe.$]
   [$ (^George^) beeing come to Waltam, did his dutie to his Mistris,
who wondred to see him, and not her husband, for whom she 
demanded of (^George^) : he answered her, that hee was at Enfield,   #
and did 
request her to meet him there. To which shee willingly agreed, and
presently rode with him toward Enfield. At length they being come
into a by-way, (^George^) began to speake to her in this manner,$]
Mistris, I pray you tel me what that Wife deserues, who through some
lewd behauiour of hers, hath made her Husband to neglect his
estate, and meanes of life, seeking by all meanes to dye, that he    #
might
be free from the shame, which her wickednesse hath purchased him?
<P C2V>
Why (^George^) [$ (quoth shee) $] hast thou met with some such       #
creature?
Be it whomsoeuer, might I be her Iudge, I thinke her worthy of
death: How thinkest thou? Faith, Mistris [$ (said he) $] I thinke so
too, and am so fully perswaded that her offence deserueth that
punishment, that I purpose to bee executioner to such a one my selfe.
Mistris, you are this woman, you haue so offended my Master (you
know best how your selfe) that he hath left his house, vowing 
neuer to see the same till you be dead, and I am the man appointed by
him to kill you; therefore those words which you meane to vtter,
speake them presently, for I cannot stay. [$Poore Gentlewoman, at
the report of these vnkinde words (ill deserued at her hands) she
looked as one dead, and vttering aboundance of teares, she at last   #
spake
these words:$] And can it be, that my kindnes and louing obedience,
hath merited no other reward at his hands then death? It cannot
be. I know thou onely tryest me, how patiently I would endure
such an vniust command. Ile tell thee heere, thus with body 
prostrate on the earth, and hands lift vp to heauen, I would pray for
his preseruation, those should be my worst words: for deaths 
fearfull visage shewes pleasant to that soule that is innocent. Why
then prepare your selfe [$ (said (^George^) :) $] for by heauen I    #
doe not iest.
[$With that shee prayed him stay, saying,$] And is it so; then what
should I desire to liue, hauing lost his fauour (and without offence)
whom I so dearely loued, and in whose sight my happinesse did
consist? come, let me die. Yet, (^George^) , let mee haue so much    #
fauour at
thy hands, as to commend me in these few words to him: Tell him,
my death I willingly imbrace, for I haue owed him my life (yet no
otherwise but by a wiues obedience) euer since I call'd him
Husband: but that I am guilty of the least fault toward him, I vtterly
deny: and doe (at this houre of my death) desire that heauen would
powre down vengeance vpon me, if euer I offended him in thought.
Intreat him that he would not speake ought that were ill on mee,
when I am dead, for in good troth I haue deserued none Pray 
heauen blesse him, I am prepared now, strike prethee home, and kill me
and my griefes at once.
   [$ (^George^) seeing this, could not withhold himselfe from       #
shedding
teares, and with pitie he let fall his sword, saying:$] Mistris,     #
that I
haue vsed you so roughly, pray pardon me, for I was commanded
so by my Master, who hath vowed, if I let you liue, to kill me: But
<P C3R>
I being perswaded, that you are innocent, I will rather vndergoe
the danger of his wrath, then to staine my hands with the bloud of
your deere and spotlesse brest: Yet let mee intreat you (so much)
that you would not come in his sight (lest in his rage he turne your
butcher) but liue in some disguise till time haue opened the cause of
his mistrust, and shewed you guiltlesse, which (I hope) will not
be long.
   [$To this she willingly granted (being loth to die causelesse) and
thanked him for his kindnes; so parted they both, hauing teares in
their eyes.$] [^...^]
[^GEORGE RETURNED TO TAKE OVER THE GOVERNMENT OF HIS MASTER'S HOUSE,
WHILE HIS MISTRISS, DISGUISED AS A MAN, SEARCHED FOR EMPLOYMENT. 
EVENTUALLY BECOMING A PAGE TO KING EDWARD, WHOSE ARMIES HAD INVADED
ENGLAND, SHE SPENT MUCH OF HER TIME SEARCHING FOR HER HUSBAND. SHE 
FOUND THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD VISITED HER WOUNDED IN BATTLE, WITH HER
CRUCIFIX AROUND HIS NECK. WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE RECOVERED, SHE SHOWED
IT TO HIM.^]
<P C3V>
[^---^] [$to whom hee said,$]
Good gentle Youth, keep the same: for now in my misery of sicknes,
when the sight of that picture should be most comfortable, it is to me
most vncomfortable, and breedeth such horrour in my conscience
(when I think how wrongfully I got the same) that so long as I see
it, I shall neuer be in rest. [$Now knew she that he was the man that
caused the separation twixt her husband, and her selfe; yet said shee
nothing, vsing him as respectiuely as she had before: only she caused
the man, in whose house he lay, to remember the words he had
spoken concerning the Crucifix. Not long after, she being alone,
attending on the King, beseeched his Grace to doe her iustice on a   #
villain
that had bin the cause of all the misery she had suffered. He louing
her (aboue all his other Pages) most dearely, said;$] (^Edmund^)     #
[$ (for so
had she named her selfe) $] thou shalt haue what right thou wilt on  #
thy
enemy; cause him to be sent for, & I will be thy Iudge my selfe.     #
[^...^]
[^THE DISGUISED LADY'S HUSBAND, WHO WAS BY NOW A PRISONER OF THE 
KING'S, AND THE WOUNDED MAN WERE BROUGHT TO COURT, BUT KEPT APART. 
THE KING FIRST QUESTIONED THE WOUNDED MAN BUT, EVEN THOUGH THE HOST 
CONFIRMED HIS PAGE'S STORY, HE WOULD NOT CONFESS.^]
<P C4R>
   [$She seeing this Villains impudency, sent for her Husband in,
to whom she shewed the Crucifix, saying,$] Sir, doe you know, doe
you know this? yes, [$answered hee:$] but would God I ne're had
knowne the owner of it? It was my Wiues, a woman vertuous,
till this Diuell [$ (speaking to the other) $] did corrupt her       #
purity, who
brought me this Crucifix as a token of her inconstancie.
   [$With that, the King said,$] Sirra, now are you found to be a    #
knaue:
did you not euen now affirme you bought it? [$To whom he 
answered (with fearefull countenance) $] And it like your Grace, I   #
said so,
to preserue this Gentlemans honour, and his Wiues, which by my
telling of the truth would haue beene much indamag'd: for indeed
she being a secret friend of mine, gaue me this, as a testimony of
her loue.
   [$The Gentlewoman, not being able long to couer her selfe in
that disguise, said,$] And it like your Maiesty, giue mee leaue to
speake, and you shall see me make this Uillaine confesse, how hee
hath abused that good Gentleman. [$The King hauing giuen her
leaue, she said,$] First, Sir, you confessed before your Oast, and my
selfe, that you had wrongfully got this Iewell: then before his
Maiestie, you affirmed you bought it: so denying your former words:
Now you haue denyed, that which you so boldly affirmed before,
and haue said it was this Gentlemans wiues gift. (With his 
Maiesties leaue) I say thou art a Uillaine, and this is likewise     #
false:
[$ (with that she discouered her selfe to be a woman, saying) $] Hadst
thou (Uillaine) euer any Strumpets fauour at my hands? Did I
(for any sinfull pleasure I receiued from thee) bestow this on thee?
Speake, and if thou haue any goodnes left in thee, speake the truth.
<P C4V>
   [$With that he being daunted at her sudden sight, fell on his knees
before the King, beseeching his Grace to be mercifull vnto him, for
he had wronged that Gentlewoman: therewith told he the King of
the match betweene the Gentleman and himselfe, and how he stole
the Crucifix from her, and by that meanes, perswaded her
Husband that she was a Whore. The King wondred how hee durst
(knowing God to bee iust) commit so great Uillany: but much
more admired he, to see his Page to turn a Gentlewoman; but 
ceasing to admire, he said:$] Sir, [$ (speaking to her Husband) $]   #
you did the
part of an vnwise man, to lay so foolish a wager, for which offence,
the remembrance of your folly is punishment inough: but seeing
it concernes me not, your Wife shall be your Iudge. [$With that
Mistris (^Dorrill^) (thanking his Maiestie) went to her Husband, 
saying,$] Sir, all my anger to you I lay downe with this kisse.      #
[^...^]
[^THE KING ORDERED THE YOUNG MAN TO RECOMPENSE THE HUSBAND, GIVING
HIM TREBLE THE ORIGINAL WAGER, AND GAVE THE HUSBAND AND WIFE LEAVE
TO RETURN TO THEIR ESTATE, WHICH THEY DID. ONCE THERE, THEY GAVE
GEORGE THE MONEY THEY HAD RECEIVED AS A REWARD FOR HIS LOYAL

[}HER TALE.}]

[^AN OLD WIDOWER WAS SO JEALOUS OF HIS YOUNG, NEWLY MARRIED WIFE THAT 
HE WOULD NOT LET HER OUT OF HIS SIGHT, AND SAID WICKED THINGS ABOUT 
HER TO HIS NEIGHBOURS. THIS CAUSED THE NEIGHBOURS TO TURN AGAINST HER.
IN DESPERATION, SHE CONFIDED IN HER "PEW-FELLOW", TELLING HER THAT HE 
EVEN TOOK THE DOOR-KEY TO BED WITH HIM.^]
<P D1V>
Why, [$said her Pew-fellow,$] wherfore haue you hands, but to take
the key when hee is asleepe, and to goe whither you will, onely you
must be carefull to come in at the houre he vseth to wake? Fie, I
am ashamed, that you haue no more wit: doe as I tell you, and
since he barreth you of your libertie in the day, take it your       #
selfe in

cannot finde sport to passe away the time, wee will sleepe for       #
company. 
[^THE YOUNG WIFE TOOK HER FRIEND'S ADVICE, CREEPING OUT OF THE HOUSE
WHEN HER HUSBAND FELL ASLEEP AND RETURNING JUST BEFORE HE AWOKE. 
BUT, ON ONE PARTICULAR NIGHT, SHE RETURNED TO FIND THE DOOR BOLTED,
FOR HER HUSBAND HAD DISCOVERED HER SCHEME. SHAKING WITH COLD AND FEAR,
SHE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR.^]
<P D2R>
[^...^] [$At last, hee looked out of the window, asking
who knockt at the doore?$] Tis I, kinde Husband, [$ (answered shee) $]
that haue beene at a womans labour; prethee sweet heart open the
doore. [$All these kinde words would not get her admittance, but
gained this churlish answere at his hands:$] Hast thou beene at a 
womans labour? Then prethee sweet heart returne, and amongst
<P D2V>
the residue of the wines, help thou to deuoure the groning Cheese,
and sucke vp the honest mans Ale till you are drunke, by that time
'twill be day-light, and I will haue thy friends at thy returne, who
shall giue thee thankes for thy charitie.
   [$The poore woman knew his wicked mind toward her, by these 
his mocking words, yet fought she to pacifie the same, saying,$]
Alas, kinde Loue, these things are done already; therefore pray
open the doore? No [$ (quoth he) $] auaunt Whore; damn'd Whore,
auaunt. Heere is no place, your labours haue not deserued such
fruits at my hands: No, I haue taken you, you are intrapt, you
are snared, your friends shall now know, and all the world see, that
you are a most cunning Whore: therefore rest quiet, for there you
shall stand till morning.
   [$This sharpe answere of his kild her heart; but she quickly 
reuiued the same with a tricke which she hoped would get her
admittance, which she put in execution after this manner:$] Am I
rewarded thus [$ (quoth she) $] for my charitie toward a poore
distressed woman? and is this thy thankes thou giuest mee for all my
care which I haue had of thy old and crazed carkasse? I see it is,
therefore will I liue no longer, but presently will make away my
selfe, and with my selfe thee, for the world iudging thee to bee
author of my death, will giue thee the punishment that is due vnto a
murderer.
   [$At this the old man laughed, bidding her proceed. Which she
hearing, tooke vp a great stone, going therewith to a Pond which
was within a yards length of her house, and standing at the brink,
said these words:$] Oh blessed element of water, it is thou which
wast ordained to end my misery, and to reuenge me on my
wicked husband: [$therewith hurled she in the stone which made a great
noise: then placed shee her selfe hard by the doore. Her
husband thinking shee had leaped in, and considering what danger
hee might come in if shee was drowned, ranne hastily out of
doore to helpe her: which his Wife seeing, stept in, bolting of him
forth.$]
   [$The old man stood a long time looking with his Spectacles on
the Pond: but perceiuing nothing to stirre, hee thought her to be
drowned, and with that cryed out he was vndone. Long inough
might he cry, for no neighbours dwelt neere him: at length his
<P D3R>
Wife pittied him, saying,$] Alas, good man, what wouldst thou
haue? [$He hearing it to be his wiues voice, was glad thereof: yet
continuing his churlish speeches vnto her, he bid her open the doore,
calling her dissembling Queane.$]
   [$To all this said she nothing: but at last shee tooke occasion to
emptie the Pis-pot on his head, and then said,$] There is some
Cuckolds Urine to coole your tongues heat; I'le warrant thee it is
right, 'tis of my Husbands making: so prethee, fellow, bee gone
and let me sleepe.
   [$This abuse of hers, made the old man to raile more then before:
but at last, seeing he could get nothing thereby, hee gaue her good 
words, intreating her to let him in, and hee would forgiue all that
was past, neuer letting her friends vnderstand of her 
night-walking.$]
   [$She seeing him so meeke, said,$] Old man, I could well afford   #
thee
shelter in my house, though thou hast not deserued the same: but
in so doing I shall breake my oath, for I haue sworne that thou shalt
not come through the doore not this fiue houres: now to saue my
oath, and doe thee pleasure (in taking thee out of the cold) I will
open the window in the lower roome, that thou mayst come in that
way. [$Her husband being glad any way to get out of the cold, 
thanked her for that kindnes.$]
[^WHEN THE OLD MAN WAS PART-WAY THROUGH THE WINDOW, THE YOUNG WIFE 
BEGAN TO BEAT HIS FACE WITH HER FISTS. SHE THEN SENT A PASSING BOY FOR 
HER "PEW-FELLOW" AND TOLD HER TO TELL THEIR NEIGHBOURS THAT SHE HAD
CAUGHT HER HUSBAND SNEAKING BACK INTO THE HOUSE AFTER A NIGHT OF 
"WHORE HUNTING". WHEN THE NEIGHBOURS, INCLUDING THE PARSON, ARRIVED, 
THE OLD MAN WAS SITTING AT THE DOOR.^]
<P D3V>
[^...^] [$The Mother to this lusty Lasse, seeing
him sit there with such a deformed face, raised her voice to a high
key, saying:$] Ah, thou old Knaue, thou Whore-monger, thou
decrepit Lecher, Hast thou alwayes complained of my Daughter,
making mee, and other that are her good friends (not onely to
reproue her, but more which I speake to my griefe) to hate her, for
her neglect of dutie toward thee, when the fault was in thy selfe,
when thou gauest her right to others? but see, now it is come home
by thee, shee hath intrapt thee in thy snare; thou art come home
with thy face mangled like a true Russian: now thou art the true
Picture of a brothell-house companion: thou hast the Seales on
thy face, which those creatures (called Whores) doe giue: thou
hast, villaine, thou hast.
   [$He wondring to see her Mother so against him, of whom he
hoped to be righted, said:$] Mother, I confesse, these seales are the
seales of a Whore; but of what Whore? Euen of what whore
thou wilt [$ (quoth she:) $] thou knaue, hold thy tongue, confesse not
heere, keepe that for the gallowes. Beare witnesse, good (^Sir       #
Iohn^) ,
and the rest of my neighbours, that see how my daughter is abused:
for I purpose to teach this knaue how to vse his wife better; and
not to abuse her, and then threaten her with death, if she complaine:
come downe my child, and speake for thy selfe, and let the knaue
touch thee if he dare.
   [$The yong Wife liked this well, who came downe as her
Mother bid her; & falling at her feet, intreated her (with fained    #
teares)
<P D4R>
that she might be diuorced from her wicked husband, or else shee
said her dayes were but short, for he assuredly would doe her a
mischiefe.$]
   Content thee, Daughter [$ (said her Mother) $] I will haue him
consent to let thee goe, giuing thee that portion hee had with
thee; or else I will sell Cow, Coat, house and all, to goe to Law with
the Knaue. [$The old man (her Husband) perceiuing) that they
were all on her side, and how that they would not heare him
speake in his owne defence: likewise thinking it that hee liued
with his Wife againe, he must be a contented Cuckold, said,$] Will
you heare this? Take your Daughter with you: and I will
presently giue her that portion I receiued, and take all this wrong.
   [$This pleased them all; so the Priest drew a Bill of diuorce
betweene them, and the old man deliuered backe her portion, beeing
glad that he was rid of his Wife. His wife on the other side was
glad that she had escaped that punishment which shee deserued: so
they all parted seeming friends.$]
   I marry [$ (quoth the Fishwife of (^Brainford^) ) $] this was a   #
wench
worth talking of; she deserueth as much praise as those women
called (^Amazones^) , who out of a braue minde cut their husbands
throates: and so made themselues, rulers of themselues.
   But what praise [$ (quoth the wife of (^Standon the Greene^) ) $] #
had shee
deserued, if she had been discouered, or failed in this attempt?
Nothing but curses in my minde, for she had giuen cause to all men to
speake ill of vs women: it is not the euent, but the honesty of the
intent, that iustifies the action. I thinke so too, [$said a Fishwife
of (^Twitnam^) ,$] I doe not like this foolish hardinesse: and men are
apt to speake ill of vs without cause: therefore to make amends, I
will tell of a vertuous and chaste Dame, one whose life may bee a
mirrour for all women.

[^AFTER HAVING A SON, KING OSWALD AND HIS WIFE AGREED TO BECOME 
CELIBATE IN ORDER TO "BETTER SERVE THEIR SAVIOUR".^]
[^...^] [$A Hermet being enuious at the report of
his holy life, one day went to him, asking the King how hee could
liue so holy, and yet liue with a Wife? To whom the King
answered:$] Marriage is no hinderance to holy life, for therein doe
we but follow the institution of God, which hee ordained for the
increase of the world: but further to satisfie thee, that it is no
hinderance to my holy life; take thou this Ring, and goe to her,     #
bidding
her vse thee as she would vse my selfe.
   [$The Hermet glad of this (hoping to haue kinde entertainment
at his Queenes hands) went merrily to her, deliuering her the
Ring: and told her, that it was her Husbands will that she should
vse him in all respects as shee would vse himselfe, if hee were
there.$]
   [$To this the Queene was willing, and bid him welcome, telling
him he should be serued in all points as the King her Royall
husband was.$]  [^...^]
[^AT SUPPER-TIME, THE HERMET WAS ATTENDED BY VARIOUS GENTLEMEN, BUT 
WAS GIVEN ONLY BREAD AND WATER. WHEN HE RETIRED, HE WAS SURPRISED TO 
LEARN THAT THE QUEEN WOULD BE HIS BEDFELLOW, AND WAS SOON MAKING 
ADVANCES TOWARD HER. HIS REWARD WAS A COLD BATH. NEVERTHELESS, HIS 
PASSION REVIVED AS SOON HE WAS RETURNED TO THE QUEEN'S BED.^]
<P E1R>
[^---^] [$so turning himselfe to the Queene, he began with
this speech:$]
   Most rare, beauteous, admirable, and vnparalelled woman,
I will not onely commend thee for thy beauty, and greatnesse of
Birth and place; but also I will adore thee with more then
humane worship, for the extraordinarie vnderstanding which thou
hast aboue others of thy sexe. With what a graue and sober
carriage doest thou hide thy hote affections, which inwardly doe
burne thee? Oh it is strange! therewith not onely blinding the
eyes of strangers, but also thy neerest attendants: now I
conceiue why thou commandest mee to bee hurled in the water
Cisterne, it was thy policy (thou wonder of thy sexe) to auoid 
suspition in thy seruants.
   I knew this well, and therfore did willingly endure the same,
<P E1V>
that I might the more freely enioy thy beauty now: [$therewith
'gan he to clip her in his armes; which shee perceiuing, rung the
Bell:$] [^---^]
[^THE HERMIT WAS GIVEN ANOTHER COLD BATH. HIS PASSION GONE, HE
ACKNOWLEDGED THE KING AND QUEEN WERE THE HOLIEST PEOPLE IN ENGLAND

[^A LADY CONFESSED TO HER PRIEST THAT SHE HAD TAKEN A LOVER BECAUSE 
OF HER HUSBAND'S ILL-HEALTH. AS THE PRIEST DESIRED HER HIMSELF, HE 
FOUND OUT HER LOVER'S PASSWORD AND THEN WAITED UNTIL HE MIGHT FIND 
THE LADY ALONE.^]
<P E2V>
[^---^] [$but 
the Priest (beeing well acquainted with all the turnings in the
house) came to her Chamber doore and knockt: She asked who
was there?$] (^Hercules^) ,  [$quoth the Priest. With that she rose, #
and
(thinking it to be her Sweet-heart) let him in. The Priest caught
her in his armes, kissing and vsing other dalliance, so long, till hee
had fully satisfied his hot desires: Then quietly tooke hee his
leaue without words, which she wondred at.$]
   [$Long had he not been gone, when came her Sweet-heart, who
softly knocked at the Chamber doore: she hearing it, asked who
was there?$] (^Hercules^) , [$said he. She wondring at his sudden    #
return,
opened the doore, and asked him why hee came?$] To enioy thy
sweet company [$ (said hee) $] and to passe away this night in such
sports as shall content vs both.
   [$She wondring to see him, and hee not knowing what shee
meant, (and thinking she mis-doubted his loyaltie) prayed her to
tell him the meaning of those words, which seemed more strange
to him, then rattling Welch, or wilde Irish: and he protested
likewise, that but euen then he came from his Chamber.$]
   [$The Lady now knew that she was deceiued, and that some
craftie knaue had got at her hands a more then ordinarie 
kindnesse: and 'cause he should suspect nothing, she told him that   #
shee
dreamed she had inioyed his company that night, and that he
parted from her after an vnkinde manner.$]
   Tut, [$said he,$] dreames are but false shaddowes: now hast thou
<P E3R>
the substance those shaddowes did present. [$With such louing
words passed they the night: and morning being come, her friend
kindely tooke his leaue, secretly going to his Chamber.$]
   [$She being vexed in her minde that she was deceiued, and not
knowing by whom, passed away that day, hoping ere long to
entrap her cunning Louer.$]
   [$Night being come, after her vsual maner she went to bed, where
she had not long beene, but the Priest (his appetite being rather
sharpened, then anyway slacked) came to the doore, softly
knocking. She hoping it was he she looked for, went to the doore, 
demanding who was there?$] (^Hercules^) , [$said the Priest: she     #
knowing
it to be him (by his voice) that had deceiued her, prayed
(^Hercules^) to come in and act a new labour: and vnder colour of    #
vsing
him kindely, she felt by the short haire on his head, that it was the
Priest.$] 
[^TELLING THE PRIEST THAT SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WOULD
NOT BE DISTURBED, SHE FETCHED HER SERVANTS, AND INSTRUCTED THEM TO CUT

<P E3V>
   Now tell me [$ (quoth this Fishwife) $] if this lady bee not as
much praise-worthy for her wit, as the other was for her 
honestie? [$Most of them confirmed her argument to be sound, & the   #
rest
confirmed it by their silence. Then the last Fishwife which was
of (^Hampton^) , said,$] but for a woma~ out of the abundance of her #
wit,
to abuse any man, or her selfe, in such dishonest courses, I thinke
it not good: 'cause oftentimes, the harme which shee intendeth,
and the shame which shee deserueth, lighteth on her selfe: which
I will make good by this example.

[^A DEVONSHIRE MAIDEN WAS SO TAKEN WITH HER BEAUTY THAT SHE RIDICULED
ANY MAN WHO SHOWED AN INTEREST IN HER. ONE DAY, A YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO
WAS PARTICULARLY SMITTEN WENT TO HER TO ASK WHETHER THERE WAS ANY 
HOPE OF HIM BECOMING HER SUITOR.^]
   Faire (^Millisant^) , long time (amongst other of your suters) haue
I dearely loued you, yet neuer did I receiue the least token of
acceptance at your hands: disdaine you my Birth? I am a 
Gentleman, though not descended of the highest houses, yet not of the
meanest. Mislike you my wealth? I haue enough to maintaine a
priuate Gentleman. Mislike you my parts of body? They are as
nature gaue them, I could wish they were more pleasing to your
minde. Doe you mis-doubt my loue to you? Set mee some taske
in mans possibility to performe, and it shall confirme the same.
<P E4V>
Tell me for what it is you cannot loue me, and I will reforme the
same, and by fashioning my selfe to your liking, giue you
testimonie of my loue.
   [$No whit was she moued with his pure loue, but after her
vsuall manner determined to abuse the same; and to that purpose
she answered him thus:$]
   Sir, such little libertie hath our sexe, and men such corrupt
iudgements, that our mirth is counted immodesty, our ciuillest
lookes lasciuious, our words loose, our attires wanton, and all
our doings apish: to shunne these slanders it behooueth vs to bee
carefull ouer ourselues, and not through our kindnesses to giue
inconstant and dissembling men occasion to speake ill. I taxe not
you with this common fault; yet haue I had no proofe that your
loue is any other then dissembling, therefore till I haue made
proofe of the same, by your obedience in executing my will, looke
not for any kinde fauour at my hands.
   [$These words gaue him some hope: and he being willing to
expresse his loue to her, desired her to acquaint him with that taske
whose performance would giue him that great happinesse of her
loue: and he vowed to doe it, excepting no danger.$]
   [$She seeing him thus blinde with her loue, that for her sake hee
would vndergoe any danger, with a cruell and vnmerciful heart 
vttered these words:$] Sir, I shall try you whether your loue is
of that purenesse you praise it for; I charge you, as euer you did
respect me, or hope to inioy me, for this two yeeres comming to
keepe a voluntary silence, not speaking to any creature liuing,
or to sing, or vse any kinde of sound, whereby your meaning may
be vnderstood: this is my pleasure, which if you performe not,
neuer see me: if you will do it, let your silence and sudden         #
departure
be signe of consent.
   [$The Gentleman hearing this vnkind taske, was almost struck
dead with griefe, yet said he nothing, but obseruing her co~mand,
presently departed with silence.$]
[^THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN WENT TO CORNWALL TO TEACH THE CHILDREN OF A 
DUKE HOW TO DANCE AND PLAY VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS. THE DUKE BECAME VERY
FOND OF HIM AND SOUGHT DIFFERENT WAYS TO CURE HIM OF HIS DUMBNESS,
EVEN OFFERING £500 AS A REWARD TO WOULD-BE PRACTITIONERS. MILLISANT 
SAW THE DUKE'S ADVERTISEMENT AND, ALTHOUGH FAILURE WOULD MEAN PAYING  
A FORFEIT OF £500, WENT TO OFFER HER SERVICES. BUT ALTHOUGH SHE 
RELEASED HIM FROM HIS VOW OF SILENCE, THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN HAD STILL 
NOT SPOKEN TWELVE DAYS LATER.^]
<P F1R>
[^---^] [$she now fearing he would be reuenged on her, and by his 
wilfull silence suffer her either to pay the money, or else to lye in
prison, with a kinde and louing countenance said these words
to him:$]
   Sir, if euer you loued me (as you vowed you did) let not my
former vnkindnesse be any longer cause of your neglecting mee,
my teares are sufficient testimony of the griefe I haue for it, and
I doe proffer vp my loue to you as satisfaction for my former
<P F1V>
fault: Oh then be mercifull, and louing me, forgiue mee that
offence, and through my louing duty, let mee possesse your former
good opinion of me: [$with these words she kissed him, vsing other
lasciuious toying to cause him speake.$] 
[^THE YOUNG MAN REMAINED MUTE IN SPITE OF MILLISANT'S BEST EFFORTS, 
AND SHE WAS IMPRISONED UNTIL SHE COULD PAY THE DUKE THE FORFEIT.
THE YOUNG MAN ONLY BROKE HIS SILENCE WHEN THE TWO YEARS HAD EXPIRED. 
HE IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE DUKE TO TELL HIM THE WHOLE STORY, BUT NOT 
OF MILLISANT'S INVOLVEMENT, SO THAT HE WOULD RELEASE HER FROM HER 
DEBT, WHICH HE DID.^]
