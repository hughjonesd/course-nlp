[^AMORANDA, 7 YEARS OLD, PUSHES AWAY A BOY WHO TRIES TO KISS HER.^]
[^...^] [$The poor Boy, not used to such 
Behaviour, stood staring at her, in great Surprize at the
occasion of all this; but being a Boy of some Spirit,
tho' not capable of a real Passion, he said,$] Madam, 
you need not be so proud, I have got a prettier than 
you for my Wife, and I love her better than I do 
you by half, and I will never come near you again.
[$Saying thus, away he went to make his Complaints 
at home. When (^Amoranda^) saw him gone, and with 
a design to go to another, the whole Woman gather'd 
in her Soul, and she fell into a violent Passion of 
<P 13>
Tears; the thoughts of having another prefer'd to 
her, was intolerable, and seeing the Boy go off with 
Insults, gave her a very sensible Mortification: 
Resentment flash'd in her Eyes, and her Breast heaved 
with such Agonies, as the whole Sex feel, when they 
meet with Contempt from a slighting Lover. Her 
Mother, who was as full of Mirth as she was of Grief 
upon this cutting occasion, said to her,$] Why, 
(^Amoranda^) , did you send away your Spouse, if you are 
angry now he is gone? My Spouse! [$ (^cry'd the young 
Incensed^) ,$] I scorn the little unmannerly Brat, he shall 
never be my Spouse: What, tell me to my face he 
liked another better! but I know who the saucy 
Jackanapes meant, and if ever she comes here again, 
I'll send her to him: I hate them both, and so I'll 
tell 'em; who can bear such an Affront? I shall 
never be easy till I am revenged of 'em. [$Here was 
Pride, Jealousy, and Revenge, kindled in the Breast 
of a Child;$] [^---^]
<P 14>
[^THE TALE OF A WOMAN WHO LOSES A LOVER.^] 
[^...^] [$My Father, 
a little surpriz'd at his going so abruptly off, and 
being loth to lose so advantageous a Match for his 
Daughter, went to enquire after his Reasons, which, 
when he heard, he told the Gentleman he thought 
them very trifling.$] No, Sir, [$ (^said he^) ,$] a Woman who 
will throw up her Head at me before Marriage, will. 
(ten to one) break mine after it. I know, [$ (^continu'd 
he^) ,$] if a Woman be dishonourably attack'd, her 
Scorn is needful, her Pride requisite; but a Man of 
equal or superior Fortune, who has no Views but 
her's and his own Happiness, ought to be receiv'd 
with another Air; and if ever I marry, I will have at 
least a prospect of good Usage. [$Thus the foolish 
Girl lost a much better Husband than she got, by 
thinking her Pride added to her Charms, and gave 
new Graces to her Behaviour.$]
[^AMORANDA IS 15 YEARS OLD. LORD LOFTY COMES TO SEE HER AND FINDS A
LETTER WARNING AMORANDA OF HIM.^]
<P 16>
[^---^] [$he shuffled the Letter 
into his Pocket, and with a Countenance half 
confounded, went to meet her.$] Good-morrow, my Lord, 
[$ ( (^said^) Amoranda, (^with the gayest Air^) ;) $] how are we 
to construe those early Sallies of yours? not to Love, 
<P 17>
I suppose; because Mr. (^Congreve^) tells us, (^A 
contemplative Lover can no more leave his Bed in a morning, 
than he can sleep in it^) .
   Madam, [$ (^said my Lord, (who began to gather Courage 
from her Behaviour^) ) $] a contemplative Lover has some 
respite from his Pain, but a restless one has none; I 
hope you will believe I am one of this last sort, and 
am come to look for my Repose where I lost it. Fye! 
fye! my Lord, how you talk! [$ (^said^) Amoranda;$] you're 
a Man of so much Gallantry, there's no dealing with 
you. Come, [$ (^said she^) ,$] take my Hand, and let us go 
to the Fish-Ponds, I have order'd the Tackling to 
be carry'd down before us, we will try if we can 
find any Sport this Morning. Madam, [$ (^said my Lord^) ,$]
every thing is Diversion in your Company, and if 
you can captivate your Fish as fast as you do those 
of your own Species, your Ponds will be in a little 
time quite ruin'd.
   O! my Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] if I catch too 
many of either sort, I have a very good way of 
disposing of them. 
   After what manner? [$ (^said my Lord^) .$] Why, [$ (^said she^) ,$]
one I throw into the Water again, and t'other may 
consume in his own Flames. Madam, [$ (^said my Lord^) ,$]
he's a cruel Deity, who is pleas'd with nothing but 
the Life of his Worshippers. 
   N--ay, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] so he is; I own I pity the 
poor Fellows sometimes: but you know, my Lord, 
we can't love every body, they should e'en keep out 
of harm's-way.
   [$By this time they were come to the Pond, and 
the Anglers fell to work; but before they had catch'd 
any thing to speak of, a Footman came to tell his 
Lady, Mr. (^Pert^) was come to wait upon her.$] Fly, 
[$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] and tell him I come. My Lord, 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] you will please to pardon me a moment, I'll 
go and try if I can engage Mr. (^Pert^) in our 
Diversion, and bring him with me. [$Without staying for my
<P 18> 
Lord's Answer, she ran towards the House, and left 
him with the Angle in his hand: he had now a 
little time to consider the Lady, but what to make of 
her, he knew not; he took the Letter out of his 
Pocket, and read it over again, then said to himself,$] 
-- 'Twas lost Labour in the Lady who writ it, for 
(^Amoranda^) takes no notice of it, her Behaviour is 
open and free as ever, I shall certainly meet with a 
critical Minute, and then adieu to Gallantry on this 
side the Country. [$Before he had ended his 
Soliloquies he saw the Lady coming back alone, and went 
to meet her;$] What, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] are you 
without an Attendant? Yes, my Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$]
I could not persuade Mr. (^Pert^) to venture this way, 
he said the Sun always put out the Stars, and he 
should give but a glimmering Light where there was 
such a superior Brightness. 
   Madam, [$ (^said my Lord^) ,$] I once thought Mr. (^Pert^) so 
full of himself, that he scorn'd Improvement; but I 
find your Ladyship's Conversation has made a 
considerable Alteration.
   Pray, my Lord, have done, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] for I 
freely own I am not proof against Flattery, there is 
something so inexpressibly pleasing in it -- Lard! 
you Men -- Come, let us catch some Fish, and 
divert the Subject. Hang the Fish, [$ (^said my Lord^) :$]
Aye, [$ (^said Amoranda^) ,$] for we shall never drown them. 
But how comes it, my Lord, [$ (^said she^) ,$] you are so 
indifferent to such a fine Diversion? Because, 
Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I have a finer in view; 'tis to affront 
the Heart I am so eager in pursuit of, to give way 
to any other Diversion. Come, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] let 
us leave this Drudgery to your Servants, and take 
a Walk in yonder pleasant Grove, where I may have 
an Opportunity of laying open to you a Heart ready 
to burst with Love. [$Here he took her Hand, and 
led her towards the Garden, when (^Jenny, 
Amoranda's^) Maid, met them, and told my Lord, a Servant 
<P 19>
was just come to tell his Lordship his Brother was 
newly alighted. Never any News was more 
unwelcome than this was to my Lord, who made himself 
now sure of (^Amoranda's^) Consent to any thing he 
should request of her, and he thought a very few 
Minutes would have compleated his Happiness. He 
stamped, and cursed his Disappointment, and, with 
Vexation and Madness in his Looks, took his leave 
for that time. He was no sooner gone, than (^Jenny^) 
(who was all poor (^Amoranda^) had now to advise her) 
began to talk to her Lady about Lord (^Lofty^) .$] I am 
no less concerned than surprized, Madam, [$ (^said she^) ,$]
to see you so free in this Gentleman's Company, 
after the Account you have had of his Temper in 
general, and his particular Behaviour to the poor 
Lady who writ to you. I wish it were in my power, 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] to prevail with you to see him no more; I 
read his Designs in his Looks, and am satisfy'd his 
Intentions are dishonourable. [$At this, (^Amoranda^) burst 
out a laughing.$] The poor Lady that writ to me, 
[$ (^said she, in a jeering Tone^) ,$] one of his Tenant's 
Daughters, I suppose, who he, for a Night's Lodging 
promised Marriage, perhaps; and the Creature thinks, 
because he made a Fool of her, he has and must do 
so by all the Sex: no, no, (^Jenny^) , some People, when 
they are gauled themselves, would feign make other 
Folks smart too; but I love to disappoint their 
Spite, and will, for that reason, take no notice 
on't.
   Madam, [$ (^said^) Jenny,$] that Letter looks as if it 
came from a finer hand than you seem to think it 
does; look it over once more, and -- Aye, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda, (^feeling in her Pocket^) ,$] but where is it? I had it 
last Night in the Orange-walk, and have certainly 
dropt it there, let us go and look for it. No 
Madam, [$ (^said^) Jenny,$] we need not, if you dropt it there, 
my Lord has found it, for there he walked all the 
while you were dressing. That can never be, [$ (^said^) 
<P 20>
(^Amoranda^) ,$] he is a Man of too much Honour to 
open a Letter directed to me; I am sure, [$ (^said she^) ,$] had 
he found it, I should have had it again, therefore go 
and look for't. [$While (^Jenny^) was gone in quest of 
the Letter, (^Amoranda^) began to recollect herself, and 
remembred she saw my Lord at a distance putting 
a Paper into his Pocket, and, when she came nearer to 
him, look'd confus'd; however, she had said so 
much already in vindication of his Honour, that 
she was resolved to conceal her own Thoughts, 
and (^Jenny^) returning without it, they both went 
in.$]
[^AMORANDA AND HER LOVER FROTH SIT IN A GARDEN.^]
[^...^] [$One 
Day (^Amoranda^) and (^Froth^) were set in a beautiful 
<P 21>
Summer-house in the Garden, which had Sashes to the 
High-way, and here they sat when (^Froth^) thus 
accosted her.$] Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] it is now six weeks 
since I first broke my Mind to you; and if I am six 
more in suspence, it will break my Heart too. I am 
not unsensible of, or unthankful for the Favours you 
have shown me; I know I am the happy Man who 
stands fairest in your Esteem, and since your Eyes 
declare your Heart is won, why do you retard my 
Joys? You're a very pretty Fellow, [$ (^said^) Amoranda 
(^laughing^) ,$] to make yourself so sure of a Body! how 
can you believe I shall be so silly, as to think of 
marrying, while I have so fresh a Bloom upon my Cheeks? 
No, Mr. Froth, [$ (^said she^) ,$] it will be time enough for 
me to be a Wife, when that dreadful thing Decay 
gets hold of me; but if it will be any satisfaction to 
you, I don't care if I tell you, I have not a less 
Value for you than for the rest of my Lovers. Madam, 
[$ (^said he^) ,$] my Extasy would have been more compleat, 
had you said a greater. Oh, [$ (^said she^) ,$] that's enough 
for once, but I don't bid you despair. [$As she 
spoke these words, she turn'd her Head, and saw 
(^Callid^) [^ANOTHER LOVER^] coming, and having a mind for a little  #
variety
of Courtship, desired (^Froth^) to go and pull a few 
Nectarines; which he readily did, laughing in his 
sleeve at poor (^Callid^) , who he was very sure wou'd 
meet with a cold Reception. As soon as (^Callid^) had 
reach'd (^Amoranda^) , he began with a very submissive 
Air, and said,$] Madam, I am now so far from 
coming to repeat my presumptive Love, that I come in 
the highest Despair to resign it; I am too sensible 
how little I have deserv'd a return from you, and 
since my Estate is too small for you -- Your Estate, 
[$ (^said^) Amoranda, (^interrupting him^) ,$] I wonder, Mr. 
(^Callid^) , you shou'd name it; 'tis trifling indeed compared 
to your Merit; I wou'd have you believe I have so 
good a taste, as to set the highest Value upon the 
richest Gem, and I am sorry my Behaviour has given 
<P 22>
you any despairing Thoughts. Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I 
have no cause to complain of your Behaviour, but 
Hope is a most tiresome thing when it hangs too long 
upon our hands; but here comes one, to whom I 
must give place. 
   Believe me, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] you mistake, and I 
will comply so far with your satisfaction, as to say, 
you stand as fair in my Esteem as he does. [$By this 
time (^Froth^) came to 'em, and complaining of Heat, 
threw up the Sash. Some little time after, a 
Gentleman rid by, and threw in a Glove at the 
Window; (^Amoranda^) , at whose foot it fell, took it up, 
and found there was something in it, which she 
conceal'd, but was much surpriz'd at the Action. As 
she was putting it into her Pocket, she saw 
Lord (^Lofty^) coming, and leaving (^Froth^) and (^Callid^) in the 
Summer-house, went to meet him.$] What an age, 
[$ (^said he^) ,$] have I been detain'd from my charming 
(^Amoranda^) ? Oh! come down this Walk, and let 
me tell you how Absence has tortur'd me ever since 
I left you.
   [$While my Lord and (^Amoranda^) were walking in 
the other part of the Garden, (^Froth^) and (^Callid^) began 
to compare Notes, and talk of the weighty Affair in 
which they were both concern'd.$] Mr. (^Callid^) , [$ (^said 
Froth^) ,$] you and I come here upon the same Errand, 
and in regard to our former Friendship, I must tell 
you, (^Amoranda^) is partly dispos'd of, and for that 
reason I wou'd advise you to desist; a Man's 
Discretion is greatly to be call'd in question, who, after so 
many Repulses, as doubtless you have met with, will 
still go on in a fruitless attempt. 'Tis true, we are 
both Men of Merit, but Love you know is blind, 
and if she finds just difference enough to turn the 
Scale to my advantage, I think you ought to drop 
your Amour, and leave the Lady and I to our own 
happy Inclinations. Hum -- [$said (^Callid^) ,$] you are, I must 
<P 23>
own, a Man of a sanguine Complexion, but a little 
too much upon the Volatile; your Understanding 
evaporates, and you never had a solid Thought in 
your Life, otherwise you wou'd tell yourself, this 
Woman has no more regard to you than to all 
Mankind in general. Perhaps she has given you some 
Cause to hope; why, she has done the same by me, 
and is this minute doing the same by yon Nobleman, 
and to-morrow, five hundred more shall meet with 
the same encouragement, if they attack her. No, 
(^Froth^) , [$ (^said he^) ,$] this way will never do; but if you 
will give into my Measures, we may find out one that 
will. You and I have been long Friends, and old 
Acquaintance, our Estates are sunk to a low ebb, tho' 
we have hitherto made that a Secret to the World; 
(^Amoranda^) is not the Prize we seek after, it is her 
Fortune we want, and part of it, at least, we will 
have, if you will close with my Design. Well, [$ (^said^) 
Froth,$] I never sign blank Bonds, let me know what 
your Design is, and as I like it, I will comply with it; 
but why the Devil, [$ (^said he^) ,$] shou'd I lose the 
Substance for the Shadow? I am sure she bid me not 
despair an hour ago, and who wou'd desire more 
Encouragement?
   I find, [$ (^said^) Callid,$] you are running away with the 
old Bait, that has catch'd so many Fools already; 
for my part, I nibbled at it too, but it smelt so stale, 
I did not like it: and if you'll be advised by a Friend, 
who can see as far into a Mill-stone as you can do, 
you'll shun the Trap as well as I. Come then, [$ (^said^) 
Froth,$] let us hear this Scheme of yours. I know, 
[$ (^said^) Callid,$] it will at the first Hearing seem a little 
impracticable, but I don't doubt of convincing you in 
a small time of its Possibility. I have often heard 
(^Amoranda^) say, she pass'd her whole Evenings in this 
Summer-house when the Weather is hot; now 
where would be the difficulty of whipping her out 
of this low Window into a Coach provided ready, 
<P 24>
and carrying her to a House which I have taken care 
of, keeping her with the utmost privacy, till she 
resolves to marry one of us, and t'other shall share the 
Estate.
   Aye, [$ (^said^) Froth,$] if this were but as soon done as 
said, I should like the Contrivance well enough; but 
pray, [$ (^said he^) ,$] don't you think her Maid and she 
wou'd make a damn'd noise when they were carry'd 
off? Yes, [$ (^said t'other^) ,$] I believe they wou'd, but we 
might easily prevent it, by a pretty little Gagg for a 
minute or two, till we got them into the Coach. Well,
[$ (^said^) Froth,$] but when we have taken all these pains, 
what if she will marry neither of us, and the Hue 
and Cry catch us, as to be sure it will soon be after 
us; then, instead of a fine Lady, with a fine Estate, 
we shall each of us get a fine Halter. Thou art a 
cowardly Puppy, [$ (^said^) Callid,$] and I am sorry I have 
laid myself so open to you; do you think I do my 
Business by halves? or that an Affair of such 
Consequence is to be neglected in any part? No, the 
Devil himself can't find her where I intend to carry 
her; and if she will not immediately comply to 
marry one of us, she will at least come to terms for her 
liberty: you know we cannot stay long in (^England^) , 
unless we have a mind to rot in a Jayl, and if we can 
but screw out each of us a thousand Pound, we will 
away to the Czar, and let the Law hang us when it 
can catch us.
   Why Faith, [$ (^said^) Froth,$] I believe such a Project 
might be brought to bear, but how shou'd we get 
the Money brought to us? She shall draw a Bill 
upon her Banker, [$ (^said^) Callid,$] for as much as we can get 
out of her, then we'll ride post to (^London^) and receive 
it. And when, [$said Froth,$] are we to go about this 
Work? for methinks I wou'd fain have it over; I 
have still a fancy (^Amoranda^) will be mine, and if she 
be willing to marry me, will you promise not to 
oppose it? Nay, [$ (^said^) Callid,$] if she will marry either 
<P 25>
of us, I do not see why it may no be me as well as 
you; I will not make a Deed of Gift of the Lady 
neither, but if it comes to that, she shall e'en draw 
cuts for us, and the lucky Loon take her.
   [$What an unhappy Creature is a beautiful young 
Girl left to her own Management, who is so fond of 
Adoration, that Reason and Prudence are thrust out 
to make way for it; till she becomes a prey to every 
designing Rascal, and her own ridiculous Qualities 
are her greatest Enemies! Thus it might have fared 
with poor (^Amoranda^) , had not a lucky hit prevented 
it, which the Reader shall know by and by. While 
this Contrivance was carrying on in the 
Summer-House, my Lord was employ'd in another of a 
different kind: he thought his Quality sufficient to justify 
all his Actions, and never feared a Conquest,
whereever he vouchsafed an Attempt.$] Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$]
why are we to spend our time in this Garden, where 
so many Interruptions may break in upon our 
Privacies? I desire an Audience where none but Love 
may be admitted.
   My Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] did you ever see a finer 
Goldfinch in your Life than that Cock in the 
Pear-Tree? That very Cock, my Lord, is Grand-sire to 
all my little warbling Company within doors; I 
remember him, and know him by a little uncommon 
Spot over his Eye: Oh 'tis a charming Bird, I have 
set a Trap-Cage for him a thousand times, but the 
dear Creature is so cunning -- Well, every thing loves 
Liberty, and so do I; don't you, my Lord? Yes, 
Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I lov'd it, and always had it 'till I 
knew you; but I am so intangled now in your 
Charms, I never expect to disengage my self 
again.
   Well, I'll swear, my Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda$] that's 
a pity; methinks a Man of your Gallantry should 
never marry. Marry! [$ (^said my Lord in great surprize^) ,$] no, 
I hope I shall never have so little love for any Lady as 
<P 26>
to marry her: Oons! the very Word has put me 
into a Sweat, the Marriage-Bed is to Love, what a 
cold Bed is to Melon-Seed, it starves it to death 
infallibly. Aye, I believe it does, my Lord, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda;$] however, one thing I have often observ'd, 
when once a Woman's married, no body cares for 
her but her Husband; and if your Lordship's 
Remarks be true, not he neither; so that, my Lord, I 
think we must live single in our own defence. But, 
my Lord, [$ (^said she^) $] -- what was I going to say -- 
Oh! pray give me a pinch of Snuff. Nay, Madam, 
[$ (^said my Lord^) ,$] this is trifling with my Passion, I 
cannot live upon such Usage; either ease my 
Sufferings, or take my Life. I'll swear, my Lord, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda,$] you are a bewitching Man; what a 
Breach have I made in good Manners by your 
agreeable Conversation! I left poor Mr. (^Froth^) , and 
Mr. (^Callid^) , in the Summer-House two hours ago, 
and had quite forgot they were there: sure the poor 
Toads are not there still. Damn the Toads, [$ (^said Lord 
Lofty^) ,$] are they a Subject fit for your Thoughts? No, 
my Lord, [$ (^said she^) ,$] you see I forgot 'em; but pray let 
us go in, we shall have the Owls about our Ears, if 
we stay here any longer, 'tis just dark. [$Lord (^Lofty^) 
was strangely ruffled at this Behaviour; and tho' he 
still hoped for a pleasing end of his Amour, he 
plainly saw it would not be so easily attained as he at first 
vainly imagined: he therefore took his leave for that 
Night, and hoped the next Interview would prove 
more favourable. (^Amoranda^) was very glad when she 
found herself alone, that she might have time to 
examine the Glove which came so oddly into the 
Summer-House Window.$] (^Jenny^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] call for 
Candles, and come here. [$When she was sate, and 
had got Lights, she took out the Glove;$] Oh
(^Jenny^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] what a sad afternoon has my 
Curiosity had, and how much have I longed to see 
what I have got here? [$She opened the top of it, 
and found a Letter:$] So, [$ (^said she^) ,$] here is some new 
<P 27>
Conquest, but the strangest way of letting me know 
it that ever was invented. [^...^]
[^THE LETTER ADVISES AMORANDA TO GET RID OF "THREE-FOURTHS" 
OF HER FAUNING, FLATTERING LOVERS.^]
   Why (^Jenny^) , [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] did you ever hear 
any thing so impudent in your Life? Oh! Lud, I 
have not patience with the familiar Brute, I would 
give a thousand Pounds to know the Author; what 
shall I do to be revenged? Truly Madam, [$ (^said^) 
Jenny,$] I must own if this be a Conquest, 'tis made 
upon a very insulting saucy Lover; and yet I believe he 
means well too.
   Mean well! [$ (^said^) Amoranda;$] what good meaning 
can he have, who persuades me to banish the Bees, 
and live in the Hive by my self? No Madam, [$ (^said^)
<P 28> 
(^Jenny^) ,$] your Ladyship mistakes him, 'tis the Wasps 
he would have you discard, who come to sting and 
steal from those who have a better Title to the Sweets 
of your Favours; But, Madam, [$ (^continued she^) ,$] do you 
think you should know him again, if you see 
him?
   Not I, [$ (^said Amoranda^) ,$] I never saw his Face, he 
flung in the Glove before I knew any body was near; 
and had he not rid away in a Cloud of Dust, I 
should have thought it had been a Challenge to some 
of the Gentlemen in the Summer-House: but what 
vexes me most, [$ (^said she^) ,$] is his Pity; I always thought 
a Woman of Youth, Beauty, and such a Fortune as 
mine is, might raise Envy in many, but Pity in 
none.
   [$Here the House-keeper came in to speak with her 
Lady, and put a stop to their present Discourse, 
by making way for something of greater moment.$] 
Madam, [$ (^said she^) ,$] if your Ladyship be at leisure, I have 
a Secret of great Importance to communicate to you. 
Prithee then, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] let us have it, perhaps 
it may put something else out of my head. Madam, 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] I went this Afternoon into my little Room 
over the Summer-house, where you know I dry my 
Winter-Herbs, and while I was turning them, your 
Ladyship came in with Mr. (^Froth^) , and (^Callid^) came to 
you. You may please to remember, Lord (^Lofty^) gave 
you an opportunity of leaving them, which you had 
no sooner done, than they began to lay a most 
dangerous Plot against you; -- [$ (so told her Lady what the 
Reader has heard already) $] But, [$ (^continu'd she^) ,$] as soon 
as they had laid their Scheme, Mr. (^Callid^) said he 
would go and provide a Coach, and two or three 
Villains (like himself) to assist. As soon as he was 
gone, Mr. (^Froth^) began to consider with himself what
was best to do, stick to the first Design, or discover 
all to your Ladyship. Now, (^said he^) , have I a fair 
Opportunity of turning (^Callid's^) Knavery to my own 
<P 29>
advantage, by discovering all to (^Amoranda^) ; so 
signal a Service can be attended with nothing less than 
her dear self, and then I have her without any 
Hazard or Partner. But then, (^said he again^) , as my 
Friend has well observ'd, the Devil can't fix a 
Woman of her Levity; perhaps when I have ruined his 
Design, by telling her the Danger she is in, my 
Reward may be a Court'sy, and I thank you Mr. (^Froth^) , 
and when it lies in my power I'll serve you again:
there's an end of his hopes and my own too. No, 
(^said he^) , without I were sure of making Sport, I am 
resolv'd I will spoil none, and good Luck assist our 
Undertaking; while yonder Lord is so much at her 
Service, we need expect no Favours but what we 
force, so (^Callid^) I follow thee to provide for them. 
Saying thus, he went out of the Garden thro' the 
Back-Door. Oh the impudent Rogues! [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda:$] Well, and when, (^Brown^) , [$ (for that was the 
House-keeper's Name) $] is this fine Project to be put 
in execution? To-morrow night, Madam, [$ (^said she^) .$]
What, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] whether I am there or no? 
tho' I spend a good deal of time there, I am not 
always there. No, Madam, [$ (^said^) Brown,$] I forgot to 
tell your Ladyship that part of the Contrivance; you 
are to be entertain'd with a Dance of Shepherds and 
Shepherdesses in the High-way by Moon-light, just 
at the Summer-house Window, and if you happen to 
have any Company, 'tis to be put off till next Night, 
under pretence of one of the Dancers being not well. 
Very fine, [$ (^said^) Amoranda;$] Well, since the worthy 
Gentlemen have begun a Scheme, I'll throw in my 
Counter-Plot among them, and see who will come 
best off.
[^AMORANDA RECEIVES A LETTER FROM HER UNCLE, WHO HAS APPOINTED 
A MAN NAMED FORMATOR AS AMORANDA'S GUARDIAN.^]
<P 30>
   [$When (^Amoranda^) had read the Letter, she look'd 
a little earnestly at (^Formator^) , possibly not very well 
pleas'd with a Guardian of such an Age; but she 
consider'd she had a Father and Mother to please 
in the Person of her Uncle, and he such a one as 
made up the loss of both to her: for which 
Reason she resolved to use him as directed in that 
Letter, and said to him, with a Smile,$] I find, Sir, I am 
no longer my own Mistress, but am now to live under 
your Restrictions; I promise you I will always 
listen to your Advice, and take it as often as I can; but 
I hope, Sir, you will remember I am gay and young, 
<P 31>
you grave and old, and that the Disparity in our 
Years may make as great a one in our Tempers: I'll 
therefore make a bargain with you, if you will bear 
with a little of my youthful Folly, I will bear with a 
great deal of your aged Sagacity; and we will be as 
agreeable to one another, as 'tis possible for Age and 
Youth to be.
   Madam, [$ (^said^) Formator,$] I agree to all your 
Proposals, and shall be very cautious how I presume to 
advise; and if I ever do so, it shall be when your 
own Reason must side with me; and I see already 
you have too much Sense to act against that, unless 
by Inadvertency. All young People, Madam, are 
fond of Pleasure, and every Thought that opposes 
it, is thrust out with disgrace; but -- O Lud! 
[$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] I believe you are to be the Chaplain 
too, if you talk thus much longer, you'll argue me 
out of my Senses; I told you I could not come into 
your grave Measures of a sudden. Come, Sir, there's 
nothing in't, an innocent Chearfulness is much more 
acceptable both to God and Man, than a crabbed 
sour Temper, that gives every body the Gripes to 
look at it. Madam, [$ (^said^) Formator,$] you quite 
mistake me: I am not of that disagreeable Temper you 
have described; I would have both Young and Old 
act with that very innocent Freedom you speak of: 
but what I inveigh against, is an immoderate Love 
of Pleasure, which generally follows the Young, and 
too often leads them to Destruction.
   Pray, Sir, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] what is it you call 
Pleasure?
   Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I call every thing Pleasure that 
pleases us, and I dare say you will own a great many 
things may and do please us, which are in 
themselves very faulty: as for example, suppose a fine 
young Lady of superiour Beauty should spread her 
Purlieus to catch all Mankind, I doubt not but it 
would give such a one exquisite Pleasure; but it is 
<P 32>
at the same time a great fault to give other People 
exquisite Pain, as the rest of the Sex must certainly 
feel, when they see one Monopolizer engross the 
whole Male World to herself. Nay, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] 
there never was any such thing in nature, as one 
Woman engrossing the whole contrary Sex; believe 
me, Sir, you all love Variety too well for that, and 
your Affections, like your Money, circulates all the 
Nation over; so that it is only who can keep their 
Lovers longest we strive for, not who can keep them 
always, for that we none of us expect. But come 
(^Formator^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] I must own you are come at a 
very critical Juncture, and since my Uncle has 
enjoin'd me to use you as I would him, after Supper 
I will give you an early Proof of my Duty to him, 
and my Confidence in you.
   [$Supper ended, (^Amoranda^) told (^Formator^) the whole 
Story of (^Froth^) and (^Callid^) , their base Designs, as well 
as beggarly Circumstances. (^Formator's^) Cheeks glow'd 
with Anger, and, in the highest Transport of Rage, 
cry'd out,$] How can such a Woman, such a lovely 
Woman as you are, subject yourself to such 
Company? Is it possible that fine Sense, which breaks 
from those lovely Lips with every word you speak, 
can find agreeable Returns from such Vermine? Can 
a Man mingle his Wine with Mud, then drink it with 
pleasure?
   Pardon me, dear Madam, [$ (^continu'd he^) ,$] if my Zeal 
for so good an Uncle to you, and so good a Friend 
to me, hurries me a little too far; 'tis not possible for 
me to see any thing, so deservedly beloved by him, 
run into the least Weakness; beside, you seem to 
have too true a Notion of our Sex to be so grosly 
imposed upon by them. Say no more, good (^Formator^) , 
[$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] I now promise to be governed in a 
great measure by you; and since my Uncle has sent 
you to supply his Place, I will use you with 
deference, and bring myself to comply with your 
<P 33>
Desires as far as possible. [$This Promise gave the old 
Gentleman ten thousand Joys, which sat triumphant 
on his pleased Countenance; and (^Amoranda^) could 
not forbear being pleased herself, to see how much 
he was so.$] But, Madam, [$ (^said^) Formator,$] methinks 
I long to know how you intend to use those Villains. 
That, [$ (^said she^) ,$] you shall do presently. When 
the hour is come for the execution of their intended 
Project, I design to place two sturdy Footmen, 
dressed in mine and (^Jenny's^) Cloaths, in the 
Summer-house; the hour they have appointed, will favour 
my Design as well as theirs, for ten a-clock's the time, 
and the Moon to be our Light; so that they will 
not easily distinguish betwixt the Fellows and us, 
till their Sense of feeling lets them into the secret; 
for the Footmen don't want Courage, and I hope 
my design'd Injuries will give them resentment to it: 
I dare say they will give them love for love, and pay 
them in their own coin. What do you think, 
(^Formator^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] will not my Contrivance do better 
than theirs? I hope so, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ;$] but I have 
one earnest request to make to you, and as it is the 
first, I hope you will not deny me. No, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda,$] I am sure you will ask nothing I ought to 
refuse, and therefore I promise. Then, Madam, [$ (^said 
he^) ,$] give me leave to personate you in the 
Summer-house to-morrow night.
   Alas! [$ (^said she^) ,$] what can your feeble Arm do with 
such robust Rascals? they will make no more of you 
than they wou'd of me myself, and methinks I wou'd 
not have 'em go off without a good drubbing. Fear 
not, Madam, [$ (^said Formator^) ,$] this Arm can still do 
wonders in so good a Cause; a Vindication of 
(^Amoranda's^) Honour fills my Veins with young Blood, 
that glows to revenge her Wrongs. Well, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda,$] I find I have the Remains of a brave Man 
to take my part; and since you have so great a 
mind to show your Prowess, pray do: if you 
<P 34>
happen to be worsted, we'll invert the Custom, and 
instead of your delivering the distress'd Damsel, she 
shall come and rescue you. [$This made (^Formator^) 
very merry, in spite of all his Gravity: but it was 
now Bed-time, and he was conducted to his 
Chamber by the Servants, who were order'd to use him 
with great respect. The next Morning (^Jenny^) came to 
her Lady's Bed-side, and told her she had been in 
the Garden, and had found a silver Box;$] I fancy, 
by the bigness of it, 'tis Lord (^Lofty's^) Snuff-box, 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] but there is nothing in it but a Paper. 
Draw the Curtains, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] and let me see 
it; [$ (^Jenny^) gave her the Box, and when she had 
open'd the Paper, she found it was a Contract 
betwixt Lord (^Lofty^) , and a Lady of whom she had 
often heard, but never saw her; and if Lord (^Lofty^) 
receded from his Promise of marrying the Lady, he 
shou'd then forfeit Ten Thousand Pounds, as an 
Addition to her Fortune. This Contract nettled 
(^Amoranda^) to the very heart:$] How! [$ (^said she^) ,$] does my 
Lord come here to affront me with his Declarations 
against Marriage, and at the same time is going to 
engage himself so firmly to another? Base as he is, 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] am I a Person fit only to divert those Hours, 
in which he cannot gain admittance to one he likes 
better? Give me my Clothes, [$ (^said she^) ,$] I'll be 
revenged of him, or lose my Life in the Attempt.
   [$Poor (^Jenny^) , who never saw her Lady angry in her 
life before, began to repent she had said any thing 
of the Box, and was now afraid her Lady loved 
Lord (^Lofty^) .$] Madam, [$ (^said she^) ,$] I wou'd not have 
your Ladyship in such a passion, for by the Date of 
this Contract, one wou'd believe my Lord never 
intended to give it the Lady at all; it has been sign'd 
and seal'd above a month, if it was dated at the 
same Time. (^Jenny^) , [$ (^said^) Amoranda, (^recovering herself, 
and smiling^) ;$] I fancy by your Looks, you are afraid 
I have an inward private Inclination for this 
<P 35>
worthless Peer: but as thou hast always been a faithful,
honest Servant, I will contribute so far towards thy 
ease, as to assure thee he is upon the same foot with 
the rest of his Sex, and I know none upon earth I 
have a superior value for; but I own I have so just 
a resentment against his Behaviour to me, that if the 
Lady this Paper was design'd for, will accept of it, 
I will certainly make her a present of it to-morrow. 
But, Madam, [$ (^said^) Jenny,$] may-be my Lord may 
come and enquire for it. If he comes to-day, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda,$] tell him I see no Company, and 
to-morrow I will put it out of his reach -- if my mind 
does not alter, (^Jenny^) , as I believe it will; for upon 
second thoughts, 'tis a matter of very great 
Consequence, and I wou'd not contribute [^SOURCE TEXT: contrribute^] #
to a Man's 
continual Uneasiness neither; however, I am resolved 
to see no Company to-day, except (^Callid^) and (^Froth^) , 
so pray give orders accordingly below stairs.
   [$ (^Jenny^) was very glad to see her Lady recover her 
Temper so soon, and when she had obey'd her 
Commands, she return'd to dress her, and then 
(^Amoranda^) went down to (^Formator^) ; they paid each other the 
common Compliment of a Good-morrow, and then 
went to breakfast in (^Amoranda's^) Closet, for fear of a 
Visit from Lord (^Lofty^) , who came before they had 
well begun. But his Errand was different from what 
they expected, for he neither enquired for, nor had 
miss'd his Box: but when they told him, (^Amoranda^) 
saw no Company that day;$] I know it, Child, [$ (^said 
he^) ,$] she told me yesterday she wou'd see nobody but me; 
Where is she? [$then without staying for an Answer, 
he ran from Room to Room till he found her. 
(^Amoranda^) thought his ill-manner'd Freedom proceeded 
from his Concern for his Box, and was once going 
to return it, in order to get rid of him, but a better 
Genius twitch'd her by the ear, and bid her keep it.$] 
Madam, [$ (^said he with his wonted Assurance^) ,$] how will 
<P 36>
you answer this Behaviour to Good-nature? and 
what have I done to deserve Banishment?
   My Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] I retire sometimes from 
Company, to make it more acceptable to me when 
I come into it again; and this I think, I may do as
often as I please, without a Breach in either 
Good-nature or Good-manners. True, Madam, [$ (^said my 
Lord^) ,$] but I wou'd fain be acceptable always. 
[$ (^Amoranda^) found by this Answer he had not miss'd his 
Box, or at least did not suspect she had it, and 
therefore told him, she was surprized to hear him say 
he wou'd be always acceptable, after having declared
so heartily against Matrimony.$] I fancy, my Lord, 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] you will find a Mistress a little given to 
Variety, and will hardly like you always as much as 
you may think you deserve. [$ (^Formator^) , who colour'd 
at this Discourse, began to take up the Cudgels.$] 
My Lord, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I am sent here by very good 
Authority, and have a Commission to enquire every 
Man's Business that comes into this House; I 
therefore desire to know, if, as the Lady says, you 
declare against Matrimony, what your designs are in 
coming here? Prithee, Child, [$ (^said my Lord^) to 
Amoranda,$] what queer old Prig is this? Hark-ye, Friend, 
[$ (^said he to^) Formator,$] your Business now is in the other 
World, and you wou'd do well to go and prepare 
for't, without envying us the Pleasures you are past 
yourself. My Lord, [$ (^said^) Formator,$] I am still very 
capable of Pleasure, and the greatest I can possibly 
have, is to preserve the lovely Charge committed to 
my Care, which I will do to the utmost extremity of 
my power; and do here promise you, till you give 
a better account of your Intentions, you shall never 
see her more. [$ (^Amoranda^) was not very well pleased 
with what (^Formator^) said; for tho' she was perfectly 
insensible of any Passion for my Lord, and knew his 
dishonourable Designs, she cou'd not think of losing 
a Lover of his Title and Figure without some 
<P 37>
Emotion: and said to (^Formator^) , with a little warmth,$] I 
think, Sir, you assume a Power too great for so short 
a time, and I shou'd take it kindly if you wou'd 
give me leave to dismiss my Visiters myself. [$This 
gave my Lord a new Supply of Hope, and he asked 
(^Amoranda^) leave to pull him by the Nose.$] No, my 
Lord, [$ (^said she^) ,$] whoever lays a finger upon him, has 
seen his last of me. Madam, [$ (^said^) Formator,$] if I 
have been so unhappy as to say any thing to disoblige 
you, I do here in the humblest manner ask your 
pardon; but if I am not to take notice of such 
Behaviour as Lord (^Lofty's^) , I have no business here, but may 
forthwith return to him that sent me: for your part, 
my Lord, you (^dare^) not pull me by the Nose. 
[$Saying thus, he left the Closet, but sent (^Jenny^) directly 
up to her Lady, with a charge to stay with her till 
my Lord was gone, unless she commanded her 
otherwise, and then he knew what he had to fear.
   (^Amoranda^) , on the other Hand, found she had vex'd 
(^Formator^) , which she began to be sorry for, because 
she knew it wou'd highly disoblige one of the best 
Uncles in the World, and therefore begg'd my Lord 
to leave her for that time. He told her he wou'd 
do ten thousand Things to oblige her, and desired 
but one in return of all.$] When I understand you, 
my Lord, [$ (^said she^) ,$] I shall know what Answer to 
make; in the mean time, I repeat the Request I 
have already made you, to leave me now. [$My Lord, 
with a little too much freedom, snatch'd her to his 
arms, took a Kiss, and vanish'd. As soon as he was 
gone, she went down to (^Formator^) , and found him in 
the Parlor, in a very thoughtful, melancholy Posture;$]
Formator, [$ (^said she^) ,$] I am come to tell you, I am 
under some Concern for what has happen'd to-day: I 
have, to oblige you, sent my Lord away, and do here 
faithfully promise you, I will never come into his 
Company more, without your Approbation. I own, 
I have the greatest Inclination in the world to please 
<P 38>
you, and as I believe you sincerely to be my Friend, 
as such I will always use you, and let this little 
early Quarrel rivet our future Amity. [$ (^Formator^) was so 
transported at her good-natur'd Condescension, that 
he cou'd hardly forbear throwing himself at her Feet; 
but he consider'd, Raptures were unsuitable to his 
Age, so contented himself with saying,$] Madam, of 
what use is our Reason, if we chain it up when we 
most want it? had your's had its liberty, it wou'd 
have shown you the villainous Designs of your (^Noble^) 
Lover, it wou'd have told you how much he desires 
your Ruin, that all the Love he has for you, is to 
satisfy his own bestial Desires, rob you of your 
Innocence and Honour, then leave you to the World, 
to finish the Misery he begun, by being pity'd and 
despis'd as long as you live: 'Tis true, Madam, 
[$ (^continu'd he^) ,$] you have a Fortune that sets you above the 
World; but when I was a young Fellow, we used to 
value a Lady for Virtue, Modesty, and innate Love 
to Honour. I confess, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] those are 
unfashionable Qualities, but they are still the chief 
Ornaments of your Sex, and ours never think a 
Woman compleat without 'em. 
   Give me leave, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] to go a little 
farther, and tell you how great your misfortune has 
been, in being left so long to the Choice of your own 
Company; your Good-nature, and want of 
Experience, together with a greedy Desire of Flattery, 
which, (pardon me, Madam) is a Weakness 
attending the whole Sex, has encourag'd such a heap of 
Vermin about you, as Providence wou'd not suffer 
to live, were it not to give us a better taste for the 
brave, the just, the honourable and the honest Man.
   [$ (^Amoranda^) was so touch'd with what (^Formator^) said, 
that the Tears stood in her Eyes, and she was just 
going to beg he wou'd have done, when the Bell 
rung for Dinner, and put a stop to what 
remain'd; she was never so lectur'd in her Life before,
<P 39>
however she told herself in her own Breast, that 
every Word he said was true. As soon as Dinner 
was over, my Friend (^Froth^) came in, with a design to 
sift (^Amoranda's^) Inclinations once more; and if he 
found her leaning to his Side, as much as he desir'd, 
then to discover all; if not, to stay till (^Callid^) came, 
and join with him, in the Invitation to the 
Entertainment at night. (^Formator^) , who was told before 
he came in who he was, left (^Amoranda^) and him 
together, and having a fair Opportunity of trying his 
Fortune once more, he thus began:$] Madam, I have 
often look'd with envious Eyes on the Favours you 
confer on Mr. (^Callid^) , but, Madam, as you cannot 
have us both, I wish you wou'd (for the ease of one 
of us at least) declare in favour of him you like, 
and let the other travel. Mr. (^Froth^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] your 
Friend and you, are endow'd with such equal Merit, 
'tis hardly possible to say which I like best; beside, 
if I shoul'd declare in favour of you, Mr. (^Callid^) 
wou'd not believe I was in earnest; and if I shou'd 
say I like him best, you are too conscious of your 
own Worth, to think I speak from my Heart. In 
short, every thing we do, you construe to your own 
advantage; if we look easy and pleas'd in your 
Company, we are certainly in Love; if grave and 
reserv'd, 'tis to hide our Love; thus you all imagine we 
are fond of gaining a Conquest over a Heart, which 
when we have got it, is perhaps so very trifling, that 
we dispose of it at last, as we do of our old Gowns, 
give it away to our Chamber-Maid. But, Madam, 
[$ (^said^) Froth,$] if you please we will lay by general 
Comparisons, and come to particulars betwixt (^Callid^) and 
myself; and if I, from undeniable Reasons, prove I 
deserve best from you, will you promise accordingly 
to reward me?
   I faithfully promise, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] to reward 
you both as you deserve; but here's Mr. (^Callid^) 
coming, I'll warrant he has as much to say for himself as 
<P 40>
you have. [$ (Mr. Callid (^came to 'em, and said to^) 
Amoranda) $] I have provided a little Country 
Entertainment for you, Madam, if you will do me the 
honour to see it anon. You are always so very obliging, 
[$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] -- but you know, Mr. (^Callid^) , I 
never go far from home. No farther than your own 
Summer-House, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I have engaged 
a few of my Tenants to appear in a rural Dress, and 
give you a Shepherds Dance; they have been 
practising this Fortnight, and I am in hopes they may 
prove perfect enough to give you some diversion; I 
have order'd them to be there exactly at Ten o'clock, 
by which time the Road will be quiet, and the 
Moon up; and Madam, [$ (^said^) Froth,$] a Dance of 
Shepherds and Shepherdesses, looks so (^Natural^) by 
Moon-light. -- Yes, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] so it does, and I 
promise myself already a great deal of Pleasure from 
the Hour you speak of; but I wish I had known in 
the Morning, I wou'd have engag'd Lord (^Lofty^) to 
come himself, and have brought some Ladies 
with him. No matter, [$ (^said she^) ,$] we will have it to our
selves, and Gentlemen, I desire you will not sup 
before you come, for I shall take care of a small repast 
for you, and we will sup in the Summer-House, 
that we may be near our Diversion. Come then, 
(^Froth^) , [$ (^said^) Callid,$] we will go and see them do it 
once more before they perform in the Lady's View; 
for nothing cou'd be so great a Baulk to me, as to 
have any thing wrong where she is to be a Spectator. 
[$As soon as they were gone, (^Amoranda^) called 
(^Formator^) , and bid him chuse a Companion for the Exploit 
in hand; for she told him, she had promis'd the two 
Gentlemen a Supper in the Summer-House, and she 
wou'd fain have them have a Belly-full.
   (^Formator^) took the young Lady's advice, and went 
to chuse a good sturdy Fellow, to personate (^Jenny^) , 
while he did as much by (^Amoranda^) ; and when the 
appointed time was come, they took their Places in 
<P 41>
the Summer-House, with each a good Crab-tree 
Cudgel by him, and after a little expectation, the 
two impudent Varlets came, ask'd for (^Amoranda^) with 
their wonted sauciness, and being told she was in 
the Garden, flew to their hop'd-for Prize. (^Callid^) 
ran as he thought to (^Amoranda^) , and catching her in 
his Arms, cry'd,$] No Resistance, Madam, by (^Jove^) 
you must along with me. [$ (^Froth^) did the same by the 
supposed (^Jenny^) , and just as they were going to gag 
them, and call their Associates, who waited in the 
Lane for the Sign, to their Assistance, the two 
Ladies began to handle their Cudgels, and laid about 
them with such dexterity, that the Ravishers were 
almost knock'd on the head, before they cou'd 
believe they were beaten; so great was their surprize, 
and so little did they expect to meet with such 
resistance: but when they found the blows come faster 
on, without regard to either Sex or Quality, they 
began to draw their Swords; (^Formator^) struck (^Callid's^) 
out of his hand, and the Foot-Man trip'd up (^Froth's^) 
heels, before he cou'd get his out of the Scabbard, 
which he wou'd not have attempted to do, but that 
he thought his Antagonist a Woman. All this while 
the two Ladies laid on so unmercifully, that they 
began to cry Quarter and beg for Mercy, when the 
Noise reach'd the House, and they saw (^Amoranda^) , 
with Lights before her, coming in a great surprize, 
to see what the matter was. (^Callid^) , when he saw 
her and (^Jenny^) , cou'd hardly believe his half 
beaten-out Eyes, but stood staring, first at the real Lady, 
and then at the feign'd one; but when he found 
how matters went, he cry'd,$] (^Froth^) , thou Villain, 
thou hast betray'd me. If I have, [$ (^said^) Froth,$] I am 
ill rewarded for't, and believe I shall never stir either 
hand or foot again. Well, Gentlemen, [$ (^said^) Amoranda$] 
are the Shepherds come? When does the Dance 
begin? 'Tis over, Madam, [$said (^Formator^) ,$] these 
Gentlemen have been cutting capers this half-hour to a 
<P 42>
sorrowful new Tune. Why what is the matter, [$said 
she?$] I hope you have not hurt 'em.
   Nothing, Madam, [$ (^said^) Formator,$] but (^Harry^) and 
I took a frolick to sit here this Evening in 
Masquerade, and those two Beaus had a mind to ravish us, 
I think, for they were going to gag us. I am 
sorry Sir, [$ (said he to (^Callid^) ,) $] that I was forc'd to 
exercise my Cudgel upon you, I hope you will excuse 
it; had I been in another dress, I wou'd have used 
another Weapon. I think, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] he did 
not stand upon so much Ceremony with (^you^) , for I see 
he has drawn his Sword, tho' he took you for a 
Woman. Yes, [$said (^Callid^) ,$] ready to choak with rage, 
despair, and disappointment, I took him for you, on 
whom I wou'd have had a glorious revenge, had it 
prov'd so. Oh Death and Fury, [$ (^said he^) ,$] what 
malicious Devil interpos'd? but it is some Satisfaction 
to tell you how I wou'd have used you, had Fortune 
been so kind as to have put you in my power; know 
then, proud Beauty, I wou'd -- I know already
[$ ( (^said^) Amoranda (^interrupting him^) ) $] as much of your 
designs, as you can tell me; but Gentlemen, [$ (^said she^) ,$]
if the (^Czar^) shou'd not take you into his Service, 
when you have received the Money from my Banker, 
pray let me know, and I'll make a better Provision 
for you. I have an Uncle going to the (^Indies^) who 
wants Slaves, and I believe at my request, he wou'd 
take you into his Service: in the mean time, do me 
the favour to leave this Place, for I have had just as 
much of your Company as I can dispense with. I 
hope, Madam, [$ (^said^) Froth, ( (^whose Tongue was the only 
Part about him he cou'd stir without Pain^) ) $] you have more 
Hospitality in you, than to turn us out of your 
House in this Condition; you had more need send 
for a Surgeon, to set our dislocated Joints in order, 
and wrap us up in Seer-Cloth, I don't believe I shall 
live a Week. That, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] wou'd be a 
great pity, the world wou'd have a sad loss of so 
<P 43>
worthy a Man; but I hear you have a Coach hard by, 
I shall order two of my Servants to load each of 'em 
with a Knave, and convey you both to it. I hope 
you will own I have been as good as my Word, I 
promis'd you a Supper and (^Desert^) , and believe you 
have had both. [^...^]

[^ALTEMIRA, WHOM LORD LOFTY HAS PROMISED TO MARRY, SPEAKS 
TO AMORANDA.^]
[^...^] I own, 
Madam, your Person and Fortune have an infinite 
advantage over mine; but a Man, who is resolved to 
be a Libertine, has no true value for a Woman's good 
Qualities; the best she can show to please him, is to 
<P 58>
give into all his brutal Pleasures: and as I was sure 
you would shun such a Lover, I own I did write 
a Line to let you into the temper of the Man. But 
now, Madam, that I have told you my Wrongs, I 
hope I have engaged your Justice, Goodness, and 
Pity, and you will no longer encourage his 
Addresses, but look upon them with the same Contempt, 
as from a married Man. Madam, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] 
your Case I own is very deplorable, and what 
would give me a sensible Affliction, were it not in 
my power to do you some service; but I believe I 
can make you a very acceptable Present, and will 
contrive a way of serving you beside. [$At those 
words, (^Amoranda^) left (^Altemira^) , and return'd with 
the Box and Bond;$] This, Madam, [$ (^said she^) ,$] is, I 
presume, the Loss you have so much lamented, and 
I do assure you, Lord (^Lofty^) has not been at (^London^) 
since his Injuries to you, but at a Seat he has just 
by this House, and there he is now: that Box which
I have now given you, he accidentally dropt in my 
Garden, nor does he know I have it; and till I see 
you as firmly his, as he has promised you should be, 
I will never leave contriving.
   [$The sight of Lord (^Lofty's^) Bond, gave poor 
(^Altemira^) a satisfaction not to be express'd; the Blood 
which had so long forsaken her Cheeks, began to run 
again in its wonted Channels, and Joy diffus'd itself 
in every Feature of her Face:$] Is it possible, [$ (^said 
she^) ,$] that I am so happy as to recover this testimony 
of his Villany! 'tis some little satisfaction for my 
lost honour, that I have this small justification of 
myself. 'Tis a very great one to me, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda,$] that I can contribute towards it, and if I can 
but gain one Point I have in my head, I hope I shall 
see you perfectly easy; but I have an old Gentleman 
in the House, who must be let into the Secret, or 
nothing can be done.
<P 59>
   Madam, [$ (^said^) Altemira,$] my Secrets are too well 
known to the World; engage who you please in the 
Scheme, but spare me the confusion of hearing it. 
Then, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] I will leave you employ'd 
while I go to my Guardian, and desire you will 
write a Letter to Lord (^Lofty^) , to let him know 
you have recover'd the Bond and Contract which 
your perfidious Servant return'd to him, and that 
you expect all the satisfaction the Law can give you; 
then leave the rest to me. [$Here she left (^Altemira^) , 
and sent (^Jenny^) with Pen and Ink to her, while she 
told (^Formator^) the whole Story; he needed no 
Addition to Lord (^Lofty's^) Character, to confirm him 'twas 
a very bad one: however, his Indignation was 
ready to boil over, and he express'd himself as every 
Man of Honour would do upon such an occasion.$] 
(^Formator^) , [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] I have this poor 
Creature's Wrongs so much at heart, that I shall never 
rest till I recover her Quiet; but you must give me 
leave, because I have promised never to see Lord 
(^Lofty^) more, unless I have your Consent for it, and 
without seeing him nothing can be done.
   Madam, [$said (^Formator^) ,$] I applaud your just and 
generous Design, and am so far from desiring to 
hinder it, that I will be your Assistant to the utmost of 
my power. Then, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] give me leave to 
send for my Lord this minute, and do you abscond. 
[$ (^Formator^) consented to her Proposal;$] [^---^]
[^AMORANDA'S (AND ALTEMIRA'S) LETTER(S) TO LOFTY OMITTED.^]
[^AMORANDA AND LOFTY MEET.^]
<P 61>
[^...^] My dearest (^Amoranda^) , 
[$ (^said he^) ,$] how shall I return this favour? with what 
joy did I receive your obliging Letter, and with 
what delight am I come to die at your feet? My 
Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] you seem'd so very earnest in 
your Letter for an interview, I was resolv'd to give 
you an opportunity, and shall now be glad to hear 
what you have to say. To say, my Angel! [$ (^said he^) ,$]
can any Man want a Theme, that has so glorious a 
Subject as (^Amoranda^) ? Come to my arms, my 
lovely Charmer, and let me whisper out my very Soul 
upon thy lovely Bosom. Hold, my Lord, [$ (^said she^) ,$]
before you run into those violent raptures, let me 
know your designs a little; I confess you have often 
rally'd a married State, but that I rather take to 
be a sort of a Compliance to a debauch'd, wicked 
Age, than any real inclination of your own; 
come, my Lord, confess you have a mind to 
marry. To tell you, Madam, I have a mind to 
marry, is, to tell you I have not a mind to love 
you; why shou'd you desire to subject yourself 
<P 62>
to one, whom you may for ever make your Slave? 
The very thoughts of being bound to love, wou'd 
make me hate; and take it from me, as a very great 
truth, Every Man breathing, makes a better Lover 
than Husband. Pray, my Lord, [$ (^said she^) ,$] from 
whence do you prove your Assertion? I must own, 
my experience and observations are but young, and 
yet I know several marry'd People, who in all 
appearance love one another exceedingly well.
   Yes, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] in all appearance, I grant 
you; but appearances are often false. Why then, 
[$said (^Amoranda^) ,$] by the same rule, we may believe 
the love of one of you to your Mistress, as forc'd 
and empty, as that of a marry'd Man to his Wife; 
we have no way to know either, but by their 
Words and Actions, and those that think contrary to 
both, we look upon with so much contempt, that 
we shun their Conversation, and think it a fault to 
be seen in their Company.
   What a pity 'tis, [$ (^said my Lord^) ,$] so many good 
things should be said upon so bad a Subject. I 
wonder, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] your Lordship does not get the 
House of Lords to endeavour to repeal the Law of 
Marriage: Why shou'd you Lawgivers impose upon 
other People, what you think improper to follow 
yourselves? Oh! Madam, [$ (^said the Peer^) ,$] there are 
politick reasons for what we do; but if you wou'd 
ever oblige me in any thing, let us have no more of 
Marriage. Why really, my Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] 
I am not yet at my last Prayers, so that I hope you 
will not think Despair has any hand in what I have 
said; and to divert the discourse, we will have a 
Dish of Tea. [$Here she rung a Bell, and call'd for 
the Tea-table, which was immediately brought, and 
follow'd by a Servant, with a Letter for Lord (^Lofty^) ; 
who no sooner cast an eye upon the Superscription, 
than he knew the hand to be (^Altemira's^) . The 
effects of a conscious Guilt immediately seiz'd the 
<P 63>
whole Man, his tongue faulter'd, his cheeks glow'd, 
his hand trembled, and his eyes darted a wild 
horror; when striving to recover himself, he put 
the Letter into his pocket, and with a forc'd smile, 
said,$] A Man had better have a Wife it-self, than a 
troublesome Mistress. Nay, my Lord, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda,$] if that Letter be from a Mistress, I am sure 
you are impatient to read it, I will readily dispense 
with all Ceremony, and beg you will do so. 
Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] the foolish Girl from whom this 
comes, I own, I once had an intrigue with, but --
I don't know how it was, she had a better knack 
at getting a Heart, than keeping it; besides, she 
gave me such a consumed deal of trouble, that I was 
almost weary of her, before I had her. No, my 
Charmer, [$ (^said he^) ,$] (^Amoranda^) , and only (^Amoranda^) 
commands my heart; I own no Mistress but her, 
nor will I ever wear any other Fetters, than those 
she puts me on. Now do I most stedfastly believe, 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] that you have said as much, a thousand times, 
to the very Lady, whose Letter you have in your 
Pocket: Come my Lord, [$ (^said she^) ,$] either read it 
while I am by, or I will go away to give you an 
Opportunity.
   Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] rather than lose one Minute of 
your Company, I will do Penance for three or four; 
but be assur'd, I intended to have return'd it 
unopen'd, as I have done several from the same hand: 
but to oblige you, I'll read it. [$While he was doing 
so, (^Amoranda^) watch'd his Looks, and found a fresh 
alteration in his Face at every line he read; but 
when he came to that part which told him, (^Altemira^) 
had recover'd his Contract, he turn'd pale as Death, 
stamp'd, and cry'd$] -- Zouns -- Bless me, [$ (^said 
Amoranda^) ,$] what's the matter my Lord? is the Lady 
not well? [$My Lord, after he had paus'd a while,
said, he was mistaken in the Hand, that Letter came 
<P 64>
from his Steward, with an account of a very 
considerable Loss he had?$]
   Pugh! [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] is that all? you know, 
my Lord, there are Misfortunes in all Families, as 
Sir (^Roger de Coverly^) says; come, come, drink a Dish 
of Tea, and wash away Sorrow.
[^LOFTY RESOLVES TO MARRY AMORANDA.^] 
   My Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] your Tea will be 
cold; I wish I were worthy to know what weighty 
Affair imploys your Thoughts?
   A weighty Affair indeed, Madam! [$ (^said he^) ,$] for I am 
now bringing myself to a resolution of doing what I 
have often thought no Woman upon Earth cou'd 
have had the power of persuading me to: But your 
Charms have dissolv'd every design, and I now offer 
you a Heart for Life. My Lord, [$ ( (^said Amoranda^) ) $] a 
<P 65>
Man of your Estate and Quality, leaves a Woman no 
room for Objection; but if I shou'd comply too soon, 
you'll think I am too cheaply won, and value me 
accordingly. Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I am one of those who hate 
trouble, and the less you give me, infinitely the more 
you'll engage me to you: Come, my (^Amoranda^) , [$ (^said he^) ,$]
your old, crabbed Guardian is now from home, and 
there is no time like that present; I will send just 
now for my Chaplain, and we will do in half an 
hour, what I hope we shall never repent of. But 
my Lord, [$ (^said she^) ,$] the Canonical Hour is past, and 
you have no Licence. The Canonical Hours, 
Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] are betwixt eight and twelve, and not 
a farthing matter whether Morning or Night; and 
for a Licence, I'll step home myself, and take care 
of one. [$My Lord just remember'd he had one by 
him, which he had purchas'd to bamboozle poor 
(^Altemira^) , and since he was in such haste, 'twas no
more than scratching out one Name, and interlining 
another; whip'd into his Coach, bid his Coachman be 
at home in half an hour, and told the Lady, in another 
he wou'd be back. (^Amoranda^) , call'd down her two 
Prisoners, who had been within hearing all this while, 
and leaving them in the Summer-House, she ran in, 
call'd for a Pen and Ink, and wrote thus to my 
Lord:$] [^---^]
[^LETTER OMITTED.^]
[^ALTEMIRA DISGUISES HERSELF AS AMORANDA.^]
<P 66>
[^---^] and when you are 
married, [$ ( (^said Amoranda^) ) $] tell my Lord you will go in, 
and go to supper, and as soon as you can conveniently, 
get to Bed, and send (^Jenny^) to conduct him to you. 
[$She here told them, she had writ to retard his 
return till it was dark;$] and now (^Altemira^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$]
I hope you are near that happiness you have so long 
wish'd for: I think I hear the Coach. (^Formator^) 
[$ (who was all this while with 'em) $] and I, will place 
ourselves where we shall hear you if you speak 
never so low; but you shall see no more of us, till my 
Lord is in bed with you, and then we will come in and 
wish you Joy. [^...^]
[^FORMATOR AND AMORANDA SEE LOFTY AFTER THE MARRIAGE.^]
<P 67> 
[^...^] [$ (^Formator^) went in first; and when 
my Lord saw him, he thought he was come to take 
away his Spouse, and cry'd out,$] Be gone, Sir, she's 
my Wife. Fear not, my Lord, [$ (said (^Amoranda^) , 
behind) $] nobody shall disturb you, only we are come 
to wish you joy. How, Madam, [$ (said my Lord, 
when he saw and heard (^Amoranda^) ) $] are you there? 
To whom have you dispos'd of me? your 
Chamber-Maid! No, my Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] I scorn so 
base an Action, but I have given you to one, who 
has the best right to you; come (^Altemira^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$]
sit up and let's throw the Stocking; besides, you 
are both gone supperless to Bed, and I have a 
Sack-Posset coming up stairs.
   [$When my Lord had look'd sufficiently round, and 
saw how matters went, he found it was a folly to 
complain, and was resolv'd to turn the Scale, and 
shew himself a Man of Honour at last; in order to 
which, he turn'd to (^Altemira^) , and said,$] Can you 
forgive the Injuries I have done you, Madam? My 
Lord, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] I dare answer for (^Altemira's^) 
pardon; but who must answer for yours? 
Madam, [$ (^said my Lord^) ,$] I am at age, and will answer 
for myself, and do upon honour declare, I am pleas'd 
with what you have done; there is certainly a 
secret pleasure in doing Justice, tho' we often evade 
it, and a secret horror in doing ill, tho' we often 
comply with the temptation. I own my design was 
to wrong this innocent Lady, but I had an inward 
remorse, for what I was about, and I wou'd not 
part with the present quiet and satisfaction that fills 
my breast, to be Lord of the whole Creation. How 
great a truth is it, [$ (^said^) Formator,$] that Virtue is its 
own reward; and who that knows the pleasure of a 
good Action, wou'd ever torment himself with 
doing an ill one? My Lord, [$ (^said he^) ,$] this happy turn 
of temper, has made you a Friend, which you may 
one day think worth your Notice: and now, 
<P 68>
Madam, [$ (said he to (^Amoranda^) ) $] let us leave the happy 
Pair, and (^Altemira^) to tell her Lord every Incident, 
that help'd to bring her wretched Circumstances to 
such a joyful conclusion.

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 70>
[^FORMATOR AND AMORANDA HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY HIGHWAYMEN.^]
[^...^] [$ (^Amoranda^) , when the Coachman was shot, fell 
into a swoon, and continu'd in it, till (^Formator^) got 
into the Coach; he laid her head in his bosom, 
and chased her temples, till she recover'd. Her 
Reason no sooner return'd, than she enquir'd after 
his safety:$] Do you live, (^Formator^) , [$said she,$] and have 
you no Wounds? No, my lovely Charge, [$ (^said he^) , 
(transported beyond himself, that he had her safe) $] I have 
no Wounds, but what the fear of losing you gave 
me; the dreadful apprehension of such a misfortune 
stabb'd me in a thousand places. Well, [$ (^said she^) ,$] I 
am glad you are not hurt, but I wish we were at 
home.
   That, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] we shall be presently; we 
have not above three Miles to your own House. [$As 
soon as they got home, a Surgeon was sent for, to 
dress the Coachman's Wounds, who was shot thro' 
<P 71>
the arm; and Amoranda was some days before she 
recover'd her Fright. Three Weeks were now past, 
since they left Lord (^Lofty's^) , in which time, (^Formator^) 
had, by a daily application, endeavour'd to form 
(^Amoranda's^) mind to his own liking; he try'd to bring 
her to a true taste of that Behaviour, which makes 
every Woman agreeable to every Man of Sense.$] A 
Man, [$ (^said he^) ,$] of true Judgment and a good 
Understanding, has the greatest contempt in the World, 
for one of those Creatures we commonly call a 
Coquet: Levity, and a light Carriage, is so very 
despicable in a Woman, that it is not possible for the 
rest of her qualities, tho' never so good, to atone 
for them; how much more does it raise a young 
Lady's Character, to have one Man of Sense vindicate 
her Conduct, than to hear a thousand Coxcombs 
cry -- Gad she's a fine Woman, she's a Woman 
of Fire and Spirit? The Commendations of such 
Men, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] are like the Compliment of a 
Dog just come out of the dirt, while he fawns upon 
you, he defiles your Clothes. Nature when it form'd 
you, shew'd its greatest skill, and sent you into the 
World so very complete, that even Envy itself 
cannot charge you with one single blemish; your 
beauteous Form is all Angelick, and your Understanding 
no way inferior to it; a Temper mild and easy, and 
a Fortune great enough to satisfy the avarice of the 
greatest Miser: and why, lovely (^Amoranda^) , must all 
these fine accomplishments be eclips'd, by that 
Foible of your Sex, Vanity? Why have you such a 
greedy thirst after that Praise, which every Man 
that has his eyes and ears, must give you of course? 
For Heaven's sake, dear Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] disguise at 
least the pleasure you take in it, and receive it with a 
modest, careless Indifference: a Man who once sees 
a Woman pleas'd with flattery, has gain'd more than 
half his point, and can never despair of success, 
while he has so good, so powerful an Advocate about
<P 72> 
the Heart he aims at. (^Formator^) , [$ (^said Amoranda^) ,$] were 
you never flatter'd when you were a young Man? 
I fancy you don't know the pleasure of it; but I 
am resolved I will never think it a pleasure again, 
because you dislike it in me; for it must be a 
disagreeable quality, or you wou'd never argue so 
strenuously against it. Nay, and there's another thing 
which will make me leave it, and that is -- Hush, 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] I hear a Coach stop at the Door, let's go and 
see who's come. [^...^]
[^TWO LADIES ARRIVE: ONE IS AMORANDA'S FRIEND ARENTIA.^]
[$As soon as Supper was over, (^Formator^) left the 
Ladies to themselves, and he was no sooner gone, than
(^Arentia^) ask'd how long he had been in the Family.
(^Amoranda^) said, about six Months:$] he is, [$ (^said she^) ,$] a 
very good sort of an old Man, if he were not so 
very wise; but the truth is, we foolish Girls are not 
to be trusted with our-selves, and he has taught me 
to believe we are the worst Guardians we can 
possibly have. Madam, [$ (said the strange Lady, whom 
we must call (^Berintha^) ) $] if we young People give into 
all the whims of the old, we shall be so too, before 
we have liv'd out half our days; I hope, Madam, we 
shall not have much of his Company, for of all 
things I hate an old Man. Oh! [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] 
you will like him better when you are acquainted 
<P 73>
with him, and will find him a very agreeable 
Companion; for all his Age, (^Formator^) has a Sprightliness 
in his Conversation, which Men of younger Years 
might be proud of. [$This Encomium of (^Amoranda's^) 
rais'd a blush in (^Berintha's^) Cheeks, which she took 
notice of, and laughing said,$] If you had not just 
now, Madam, declar'd your aversion to old Men, 
I shou'd be half afraid you had a mind to rob me 
of my Guardian. [$After some discourse it 
grew late, and (^Amoranda^) ask'd the Ladies, if they 
wou'd lie together, or have separate Beds? (^Berintha^) 
said, she always lay alone, which accordingly she 
did. Next Morning, after Breakfast, (^Amoranda^) 
took them into the Garden, and there entertain'd 
them with the Story of (^Froth^) and (^Callid's^) contrivance, 
with every thing else which she thought wou'd 
divert them; but while they were in the midst of 
mirth and gaiety, (^Formator^) came into the 
dining-room, and with discompos'd looks, walk'd a few turns 
about it, saying to himself,$] From whence proceeds 
this strange uneasiness? why is my Heart and Spirits 
in such an agitation? I never was superstitious, and 
yet I cannot forbear thinking (^Amoranda^) in some new 
Danger; there must be something in it, and Heaven, 
in pity to her, gives me warning: [$Then after a 
little pause$] -- I'll take it, [$ (^said he^) ,$] and watch the 
lovely Charmer: I know not why, but methinks I 
tremble at the thoughts of those two Women, and fancy 
I see her more expos'd to ruin now, than when she 
was surrounded with Fools and Fops. [$Saying thus, 
he went into the Garden, and walk'd at a distance 
from the Ladies, but kept his eye upon them; he 
perceiv'd the new-come (^Berintha^) close to (^Amoranda^) , 
one hand lock'd in her's, and t'other round her waist: 
This sight increas'd his doubts, and rais'd his 
indignation. At dinner he watch'd her looks, and 
found her eyes almost upon (^Amoranda^) : The sight 
was death to him, his Soul was rack'd and tortur'd, 
<P 74>
and while he flung dissatisfy'd looks at (^Berintha^) , she 
darted hostile glances at him; his suspicions grew 
every day stronger, yet was he in such a state of 
uncertainty, that he thought it not convenient to say 
any thing to (^Amoranda^) , till one Morning she came 
down before the two Ladies were stirring, and saw 
(^Formator^) walking in the Hall. She was glad of
so good an opportunity, for she had for several days 
taken notice of an unusual melancholy in his Looks.$] 
(^Formator^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] what is the matter with you? 
what new trouble has taken possession of your breast? 
I see a Cloud upon your brow, and cannot be easy 
till I know the occasion of it. Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] the 
source of my trouble proceeds from the real concern 
I have for your Welfare, which I have so much at 
heart, that the least appearance of Danger, gives it 
a fresh alarm. I confess myself extremely uneasy, 
but fear you will think me a very whimsical old 
Fellow, if I tell you, I suspect (^Berintha's^) Sex, and 
cannot but fancy he is a Man.
   I shall always, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] acknowledge 
myself obliged to you for your great Care and Caution, 
but beg, my good (^Formator^) , that you will not carry 
it too far: What in the name of Wonder cou'd put 
such a Thought into your Head?
   Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] Observation puts a great many 
things in our heads; you may please to remember, 
first, she would lie alone. Pugh! [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] 
that is what I love myself, and so may ten thousand 
more. True, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] and had my Reasons 
stopp'd there, that wou'd have dropp'd of course; 
but why so many kind Glances? so many rapturous 
Embraces? such loving Squeezes by the hand, and 
eager Desire to please you? Eyes ready to run over 
with Pleasure at every word you speak? Are these 
the common Marks of Respect betwixt one Lady 
and another?
<P 75>
   Consider, Madam, you have Youth, Beauty, 
Sense, and Fortune enough to bring our Sex to you 
in as many Shapes as ever (^Jove^) himself assumed, and 
we are always soonest surprized, when we are least 
apprehensive of Danger.
   (^Formator^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] every thing you say pleases me, 
because I know it comes from an honest Heart; but 
you are too full of Fears, and your Zeal and Care 
for my Safety, makes you look at things in a false 
light: I cannot give into your opinion for several 
Reasons; first, I think it highly improbable a 
Person of (^Berintha's^) Sense should undertake so 
ridiculous a Project; next, I can never believe (^Arentia^) , 
who must be privy to it, would be so base as to 
betray me: No, no, (^Formator^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] there can be 
nothing in it, and I beg you will lay by your Fears. 
[$Saying thus, she left him, and went away to the 
Ladies, who, she heard, were both up. (^Berintha^) met 
her with an Air of Gallantry, and led her a Minuet; 
then catching her in her Arms, kiss'd her with some 
eagerness.$] Hold, (^Berintha^) , [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] Kisses 
from our own Sex and other Womens Husbands, are 
the most insipid things in nature; I had rather see 
you dance, I fancy you do it very well, but can't be 
so good a Judge while I dance with you myself: you 
will oblige me if you take a turn or two about the 
Room. This she proposed on purpose to mind her 
step, which she found somewhat masculine, and 
began to fear (^Formator^) was in the right. Good 
Heaven! [$ (^said she to herself^) ,$] can this be true? Is it 
possible (^Arentia^) can be so treacherous? Is there no 
Justice, no Honour, no Friendship to be depended on 
in this vile World? Methinks I cou'd almost hate 
it, and every thing in it, unless honest (^Formator^) . 
[$While she was thus musing, (^Berintha^) ran to her, 
and taking her again in her Arms, said,$] My dear 
(^Amoranda^) , what are you thinking of? [$Her dear 
(^Amoranda^) , began now to disrelish her Embraces, and 
<P 76>
breaking from her a little abruptly, said,$] Madam, I
was thinking of Treachery, Falshood, broken 
Friendship, and a thousand other things, which 
this bad World can furnish us with. [$This 
Answer made both the Ladies colour, and they 
looked at one another with the utmost confusion; 
which (^Amoranda^) took notice of, and applying 
herself to (^Arentia^) , said,$] Why, Madam do you blush? 
Your Youth and Innocence are doubtless Strangers to 
all those black things I accidentally named. 
[$ (^Arentia^) , willing to extricate herself from her Confusion, 
said it was a Vapour.$] O! [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] is that 
all? then here's my Bottle of Salts for you; and 
yours, Madam, [$ (^said she^) to Berintha,$] is a Vapour 
too, I presume; I'll call for another for you, since 
your Distemper is the same, your Cure ought to be 
so too. But come, Ladies, [$ (^said she, (being resolved 
to try them a little farther^) ) $] I will divert your Spleen 
with a sight I have not yet shown you. She then 
led them up two pair of Stairs, where there was a 
large old-fashioned wrought Bed. This Bed, 
Ladies, [$ (^said she^) ,$] was the Work of my Grandmother, 
and I dare say you will believe there was no want of 
either Time or Stuff when it was made. No, [$ (^said^) 
Arentia,$] they had doubtless plenty of both, or it had never 
got to such a size; I don't believe it wants much of 
the great Bed of (^Ware^) . Methinks, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] 
they should bring up this fashion again, now that 
Men and their Wives keep so great a distance, they 
might lie in such a one with so much Good-manners. 
I dare say, [$ (^continu'd she^) ,$] we three might lie in it, 
and never touch one another. What think you 
Ladies; shall we try to-night? No, [$said (^Berintha^) ,$]
for my part, I never loved one Bedfellow, much 
less two; besides, I never sleep well in a strange Bed. 
[$The Proposal however took off some 
Apprehensions from the two Ladies, but confirmed the 
third in her Fears.$]
<P 77>
   Madam, [$ (^said^) Arentia,$] I ventured to promise my 
Friend here, before we came from home, a great 
deal of pleasure upon your fine River; here's a cool 
Day, and if it be consistent with your inclination, 
we'll take a turn upon the Water this afternoon, for 
to-morrow we must think of going home. 
[$ (^Amoranda^) was not sorry to hear that, but told them she 
cou'd not answer them of a sudden; for she knew 
they did not care to have (^Formator's^) Company, and 
whether he wou'd consent she shou'd go without 
him, she knew not.$]
   I confess to you, Madam, [$ (^said^) Berintha,$] I had 
much rather want the pleasure of the Water, than 
have the Plague of the Man; but hope you will 
prevail with him to stay at home, and let us go without 
him. Come, Madam, [$ (^said^) Arentia,$] 'tis our last 
request, gratify us in this small matter, and 
compleat the favours we have already receiv'd. Well, 
Ladies, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] if you will excuse the 
rudeness of leaving you a minute, I'll go and try 
my Guardian's good-nature. [$She conducted the 
Ladies down again, and went to (^Formator^) .$] I am 
come, [$ (^said she^) ,$] to tell you something, which will, I 
dare say, be very grateful to your ears; my two 
Ladies talk of going home to-morrow, but they 
have a great mind to take a little recreation this 
afternoon in the Barge, and I desire your Opinion of 
the Matter. Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I am strangely 
surpriz'd at your having an inclination to go abroad 
with a Person you are utterly a stranger to; you 
know the Water, for some Miles, runs by nothing 
on one side but Woods and Desarts, and has on the 
other, but one small Town; suppose there shou'd 
be a trap laid for you, and you shou'd fall into it, 
what account can I give your Uncle, either of your 
Safety, or my own Care? I am sure, (^Formator^) , 
[$ (^said she^) ,$] you do not think so indifferently of me, as 
to believe I have a mind to be trapan'd, or that I 
<P 78>
wou'd not carefully avoid all danger; but I cannot 
see how it is possible, for me to be in any at this time, 
because I shall have all my own Servants about me, 
and if a hundred baits were laid, they cou'd not 
reach me, unless I were to land; which I faithfully 
promise you, I will not do: and supposing the very 
worst you fear, to be true, and (^Berintha^) shou'd 
prove a Man, he is neither a Devil nor a Monster, to 
devour all before him, I wish you were to go with 
us yourself. No, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] I perceive 
myself a perfect Bugbear to 'em both, and wou'd not 
make your Company uneasy: May Heaven have 
you always under its kind Protection; I shall be 
transported a Night, when I see you safe home 
again. Fear not, (^Formator^) , [$ (^said she^) ,$] that Providence 
which knows my innocent Intentions, will I hope 
conduct me back again. [$Here she left (^Formator^) , and 
went to order the Barge to be got ready, and then 
return'd to the Ladies.$] Well, [$ (^said she^) ,$] I have order'd 
all things for our long Voyage, and as soon as we 
have dined we will embark. Nay, [$said (^Berintha^) ,$]
let us take a bit of any thing along with us, and 
not stay for dinner, we shall not have half pleasure 
enough before Night else. [$ (^Amoranda^) , willing to 
gratify them this once, sent fresh Orders to the 
Barge-Men, who were ready in half an hour, and 
when (^Jenny^) , by her Lady's Command, had laid in 
Wine and cold Viands, they sail'd down the Water 
with a pleasant gale. The three Ladies were set at 
one end of the Barge, and (^Amoranda's^) Servants, six 
in number, at the other; she herself was set 
between (^Berintha^) and (^Arentia^) , when (^Arentia^) thus 
began.$] Madam, [$said she,$] Fortune did me an early 
piece of Service, in making me your acquaintance 
when I was yet but a Child; I have ever since done 
my endeavour to keep up amity and a good 
understanding betwixt us, and it shall be wholly your 
fault if ever there be a breach in our Friendship; 
<P 79>
but Madam, our time is short, and there is a story 
ripe for your ear, which I must beg you will listen 
to, and hope you will contribute so much to your 
own Happiness, as to comply with the Proposals we 
are about to make to you; 'tis neither my Cousin's 
inclination nor mine to use force, but something 
must be resolv'd upon in a very short space: Nay, 
Madam, [$ (^continued she^) ,$] don't look surpriz'd, what I 
say is Fact, and so you'll find it. [$ (^Amoranda^) gave a 
scornful smile at what (^Arentia^) said, and ask'd her, 
if she thought her a Woman of so little [^SOURCE TEXT: litte^]       #
Courage, as 
to be bullied into any Compliance in the midst of 
her own Servants.$] No, Madam, [$ (^said^) Berintha,$] 
(^Arentia^) has gone a little too far, give me leave to tell the 
ungrateful Tale, for so I fear it will prove. Why, then 
[$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] do you tell it? a fault committed 
by chance or mistake, ought to be forgiven; but a 
wilful one we cannot so easily overlook. [$The poor 
Lady began now to wish she had taken (^Formator's^) 
advice, and had staid at home, for she saw nothing, 
either on her right-hand or her left, but a resolute 
Arrogance in both their Countenances; 
however they kept within the bounds of Civility, and 
(^Arentia^) once more began:$] Know, Madam, [$ (^said she^) ,$]
I am not going to tell you any thing, but what you 
might be very well pleas'd to hear; I have a near 
Relation, who is a Man of the greatest merit, a 
Man of fortune and honour; he had the misfortune, 
(as I fear I may call it) of seeing you once at the 
(^Bath^) , and tho' it be more than a twelve-month 
since, he still struggles with a Passion that will 
master him, in spite of all Opposition: Oh! turn 
to your left shoulder, (^Amoranda^) , and behold the 
Wretch.
   [$ (^Amoranda^) , who guess'd where it would end, 
look'd very serene and unsurprized, saying,$] (^Arentia^) , 
if your Friend (^Berintha^) be a Man of Fortune and 
Honour, as you say he is, why has he used 
<P 80>
clandestine Means to get into my Company? Do you 
think, Sir, [$ (^said she, turning to him^) ,$] I am so fond of 
my own Sex, that I can like nothing but what 
appears in Petticoats? Had you come like a 
Gentleman, as such I would have received you; but a 
disguised Lover is always conscious of some Demerit, 
and dares not trust to his right Form, till by a false 
appearance he tries the Lady; if he finds her weak 
and yielding, the day's his own, and he goes off in 
triumph; but if she has Courage to baffle the Fool, 
he sneaks away with his disappointment, and thinks 
nobody will know any thing of the matter. 
[$ (^Biranthus^) , (for that was his true Name,) was stung to the 
very Soul to hear (^Amoranda^) so smart upon him; but 
was yet resolved to disguise his Mind as well as 
his Body, and said,$] You are very severe, Madam, 
upon a Slave who dies for you; but if I have done 
foolishly in this Action, (^Arentia^) should answer for 
it, the Frolick was hers, and it was design'd for 
nothing else. But, Madam, [$ (^said he^) ,$] Time flies away, 
and every Minute is precious to a Man, whose Life 
lies at stake; it is now time to know my Doom, 
shall I live or die? Believe me, Sir, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda,$] it is perfectly indifferent to me which you do; 
and if nothing will save your Life but my Ruin, you 
will not find me very ready to preserve it at so dear 
a Price. If, [$ (^said^) Biranthus,$] you give me cause to 
accuse you of Ill-nature, you half justify my 
Design upon you. Pray, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] What is your 
Design? To force a compliance with my Wishes, 
[$ (^said he^) ,$] if you refuse a voluntary one. How, [$ (^said^) 
Amoranda, (^with a scornful Laugh^) ,$] will you 
pretend to Force, while I am in the Midst of my own 
Servants?
   [$ (^Biranthus^) , now grown desperate, told her she was 
too merry, and too secure;$] for know, Madam, 
[$ (^said he^) ,$] those Servants of whom you boast, are most 
of them my Creatures; the Slaves have sold that 
<P 81>
Duty to me, which they owed to you, and 
therefore Compliance will be your wisest Course. Nay, 
then, [$ (^said^) Amoranda,$] I am wretched indeed: [^---^]
