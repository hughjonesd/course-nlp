SIR HENRY SLINGSBY K=T=,
IN (^WESTMINSTER-HALL, &C.^) }]

[^INTRODUCTION AND READING OF THE CHARGE OMITTED.^]
<P A2R>
   [$ (^Lord President.^) $] Thou here standest charged for          #
High-Treason; This Court
requires that thou give a positive answer, whether guilty or not     #
guilty.
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Slingsby.$] (^I desire to have Counsel assigned me.^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] There is matter of Fact laid to your charge,    #
which amounts to
Treason, and there is no Law allowed in matters of Fact.
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^There is also matter of Law; and I desire   #
to be tryed by a Jury, which
is according to the Law of the Land.^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] We are all here your Jury as well as your       #
Judges; we are the
number of two or three Juries, and your Jury is well known, for they #
are
chosen by the Parliament; you are to plead to your Indictment.
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^I desire to know whether there can be any   #
conviction, unless it be by
confession?^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] If you had looked upon the Act of Parliament,   #
that would have
told you; it speaks of examination of witnesses, it speaks of your   #
confession,
and answer, and of your Default; and if you do not plead to it, will #
be very
penal to you.
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^If it be by the Laws of the Land, that the  #
Trial should be by a Jury;
I desire I may have that priviledge.^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Acts of Parliament make Justice and Law, they   #
are both; they
think fit to change the custom of Trials that have been in former    #
times, and
all persons must submit to it: And the Parliament hath thought fit   #
to make this
Court both Jury and Judges; and therefore I require that you answer,
whether Guilty or not Guilty.
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^I desire that the Act of Parliament may be  #
read.^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] You are before your Jury and Judges;            #
Parliaments have great care
of the Rights of the people, and have appointed this Court, and His  #
Highness
hath appointed you to be tried by us, you ought therefore to plead   #
to your
Indictment.
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^The Law gives liberty in case of Juries to  #
the Party accused, to make
his Exceptions against the Jury, which he cannot do here, where you  #
are both Judge
and Jury.^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] If you have any particular Exception to any     #
man, you may make
it; you were Sir of the Parliament, when this Act was made
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^I was a Prisoner at the same time.^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Although a Prisoner, yet you are bound by Act   #
of Parliament.
   [$Mr (^Phelps, Clerk^) $] You have heard your Charge read, and    #
Plea demanded;
the Court again requires of you, that you give a positive Answer,    #
whether
Guilty or not?
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^I am (my Lord) of an opinion, (though you   #
may account it a Paradox)
that I cannot trespass against your Laws, because I did not submit   #
to them^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] All the People of (^England^) must submit to    #
the Laws of (^England^) , to
the Authorities of (^England^) , all must submit to my Lord          #
Protector and Acts of
<P A2V>
Parliament: We sit here by Authority of his Highness, by a           #
Commission under
the great Seal of (^England^) , and by Authority of Parliament, and  #
you must
submit to our Authority.
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^The Laws have been so uncertain with me,    #
that I could not well know
them, and when I was a Prisoner I could not take notice of them, I   #
could have no
benefit by your Laws, because that is no Law to me which doth not    #
give me interest
and property to what I have; It is the benefit of Laws, that they do #
distinguish
between^) (\meum\) (^and^) (\tuum\) ; (^but when you take all from   #
me, in my case it is not so^) .
   [$Mr Attor. Gen. (^Prideaux.^) $] He may enjoy as much benefit by #
the Laws as any,
if he have not forfeited it, and I desire he may be put to answer.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] The Court again require you to plead to you     #
Indictment.
   [$ (^Sir^) H. Sl.$] (^Not Guilty.^)
   [$Mr (^Phelps.^) $] Your Plea then is, that you are not Guilty.   #
[$To which, Sir (^H. S.^)
answered,$] Yes.

   [$Mr (^Waterh.^) $] I have the command of a Company, and of the   #

   [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] Mr. (^Waterhouse^) , what Letter was that   #
Sir (^H. Slingsby^) sent to

speak to the two men
to be very importunate with the Twelve. 
   Sir (^H. Slingsby^) promised so many men. That he offered Capt.   #

   [$Mr. (^Wat.^) $] 600 to march into (^Hull^) .
<P A3V>
   [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] What men did he tell you (^Andrew^) would   #
raise?
   [$Mr. (^Wat.^) $] He said (^Andrew^) would raise 50 or 60 men     #
when he pleased; and
that Capt (^Overton^) should have a deputation to command the Castle #
under me,
he said he had good hopes of Col. (^Smith^) , and that he had a      #
Commission for him
if he would accept of it.

according to his Engagement upon receit of a Piece gave me another   #

running thus; (^Oliver Lord Protector, &c.^) took it again and       #
burned it.

[$ (^Capt John Overton^) sworn.$]
[$Mr (^Phelps,^) shewed him the Commission dated 12. (^March^) ,     #
1657.$] 
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you see that Commission delivered to   #
(^Waterhouse^) by Sir
(^H. Slingsby^) ?
   [$Capt. (^Overton.^) $] Yes, I did, he delivered it to him in the #
Castle, about the
second of (^April^) last.
   [$Sir H. Sl.$] (^Mr.^) Overton, (^what date did that Commission   #
which I then delivered, bear^) .
   [$Capt. (^Overt.^) $] This is the same Commission, and [$ (having #
it in his hand) $] I here
see it is dated 12. (^March^) , 1657.
   [$Sir H. Sl.$] (^I deny that the Commission I then delivered did  #
bear that date.^)
   [$ (^Waterh.^) 
   (^Overton.^) $] My Lord, We are upon our Oaths.

(^Waterhouse^) in his own Chamber in the

may.

They have said that
serously against me which was spoken in mirth between us; I never    #

Nor had I any

   [$ (^Lieutenant George Thomson^) sworn.$]
[$Being asked what Officer he was, he answered,$] I am a Lieutenant  #
to Major
(^Waterhouse^) , I was desired to go and see (^Sir H Slingsby^) 16   #
(^April^) , who told me
That he had great confidence in me, I said to him, why? He told me he
thought I had good thoughts of the King; his Son told me he heard    #
the King
was to come in, and to bring in a considerable Army, but knew not    #
when. Next
day I went again to Sir (^H.^) and asked him if he would walk on the #
Leads,
which he did, and there I told him I had been pondering on the words #
he last
spoke to me, who then hugging me said, I have a great deal of        #
confidence in
you, there is a design in agitation to bring in the King with a      #
considerable
Army, but he did not know how soon it would be, but told me I should #
have
notice of it, and said that the King had promised pardon to all      #
Officers but the
Lord Protector and Lord (^Bradshaw^) .
<P A4V>
   [$Sir H Sl.$] (^I confess such like discourses; but^) -- 
Waterhouse (^spoke to me that I would speak to^) Thomson (^to try    #
whether he would
be assistant, but I told him I would not, least he should not accept #
it, and then turn
him out of his place^) . Waterhouse (^pressed me to go to^) Thomson, #

Waterhouse (^invited us to his house to Dinner, after Dinner he      #
spoke to^) Thomson (^to go
with me on the Leads to shew me the Guns, we walked about, and came  #
down again,

said not: you had a
good oportunity, said he. At last^) Thomson (^came to me, and I had  #
some discourse
with him about it^) .
   [$ (^L. Pres^) $] Sir (^H. S.^) have you any thing else to say?

   [$Dr Hewet.$] (^My Lord, If I have already misbehaved my self     #
here, my error is
the more pardonable, because I have not had any Counsel; and I dare  #
not presume
to have any knowledge in any faculty, especially in the Law: I never #
did change my
Cassock into a Jump; I am better acquainted with a Pulpit than a     #

occasioned this
unusual and unaccustomed study, that hath put me into such a Pulpit  #

before. And therefore (my Lord) in as much as I have often heard     #
that there are
such niceties in the Law that a man may be lost in the severity of   #
it for a word spoken
in meer simplicity, I shall crave that there may be nothing taken,   #
in prejudice to my
innocency, from words spoken in simplicity: And I hope you will      #
please to grant me
that.^)
   [$ (^Lord Presid.^) $] Dr. (^Hewet^) , I am sorry, truly, very    #
sorry, to see such an one as you in
that place; but you are impeached of High Treason: All favour will   #
be shewn
you according to the rules of Justice. I think you desire Counsel.
   [$ (^Dr.^) Hewet.$] (^No (my Lord) it is first, that I, knowing   #
nothing of the Law, may
have nothing (simply spoken) prejudice me: and that you will allow   #
me counsel.^)
   [$ (^L. Presid.^) $] The Court is Counsel for you, your business  #

guilty.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, you sit there as Judge, I beseech you to    #
let me know by what
Commission you sit there.^)
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Dr. (^Hewet^) , we sit here by a Commission    #
under the Great Seal of

Commission.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^Pray give me the favour to have the Commission read, #
my Lord.^)
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] D. (^H.^) We know our owne Authority, it is    #
not usual to read Commissions

be submitted to.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^I am not to own every person that will sit to judge  #
me, therefore I desire to
know by what Commission you sit, and who are the Judges, and then I  #
shall say
more.^)
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Those that are to judge you are very well      #

persons are
named in the Act of Parl. I do not see so many faces as are          #

   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Dr. (^Hewet^) , I must tell you the            #
(^ (\Quorum\) ^) is any seventeen, or more of

by that Commission:

   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, with submission, the case is true, in case  #
the Commissioners were
but seventeen, and they all present, then they might hear and        #
determine; but if one
were absent, they cannot my Lord as I conceive.^)
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] You are a person of parts, and therefore we    #
may delight to hear you,
but we must keep our selves to the business of the Court: You are    #
required by the
Court to answer the Impeachment.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, if you sit by the Act, sit according to the #
Act, and then I shall
submit. It was resolved by all the Judges of the Kings Bench in the  #

   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] The Doctor did profess his ignorance in   #
the Laws, yet pretends
more knowledge than the Court: The Court are here, and know themselves
lawfully authorized to try you. Dr. (^Hewet^) , if you please to     #
proceed to give your
Answer whether guilty or not, you will find the Justice of the Court #
to be
according to the Laws of (^England^) .
   [$Dr. H.$] (^This learned Gent. I know his face, though not his   #
name; he speaks
according to worth, but I cannot answer him according to Law, and    #
therefore shall plead
ignorance of the Law, but desire to be tryed according to Law; and I #
have given you a 
Law-president, if you will go against it, I shall say no more.^)
   [$ (^Mr. Att. G.^) $] This Gent. hath it by Tradition, not by his #
owne knowledge; but
the Case he mentions cannot parallel this: The Act of Parliament     #
saith, an
hundred and fifty, or any seventeen; here are three seventeens.
   [$ (^Mr. Sol. Ellis.^) $] I think the Commission is directed to   #
your Lordships, or any
seventeen: (^Which Commissioners, or any seventeen^) , &c.           # 
[^PRECEDING 6 WORDS ENCLOSED IN SQUARE BRACKETS IN SOURCE TEXT.^] The     
meaning whereof is,
that those seventeen, or more respectively, should hear, (^&c.^)     #
There were
several (^ (\Quorums\) ^) for (^England, Scotland^) and              #
(^Ireland^) : 17 for (^England^) , 13 for (^Scotland^) , &c.
That Case out of (^Plowden^) , differs clearly from this: For, if a  #
Commission
be directed, and there be no (^ (\Quorum\) ^) , then the             #
Commissioners must all certifie.
We humbly conceive that if your Lordships be here seventeen, or      #
more, you are
fully authorized to proceed.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. G.^) $] In many Cases you have a (^ (\Quorum\) ^)   #
of persons, such and such men:
It's true, here is no (^ (\Quorum\) ^) of persons, but a             #
(^ (\Quorum\) ^) of the number; and if
there be a (^ (\Quorum\) ^) of seventeen it is warrantable.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^This learned Gent. he is better able to speak what   #
is Law than I; but
under favour, and with submission, I do not think he may judge of    #
the Laws, or the

of the Parliament. 
And (my Lord) if your Lordship please, I shall make this my humble   #
appeal to the
learned Judges of the Law; That if they will say in this respect     #
that this is a lawful
Judicature, I shall proceed.^)
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] You have heard the words of the Act of         #
Parliament read, Authority

(^Which said

or more of them; and you
have heard the judgement of the Court upon that. That which you      #
speak of in
relation to my Lord of (^Leicester's^) Case is true; if a Commission #
be directed to
Commissioners, and no (^ (\Quorum\) ^) appointed, then all must      #
certifie: But by the Act
of Parliament, and the Commission made in pursuance of it, the       #
(^ (\Quorum\) ^) is
seventeen: But here are three (^ (\Quorums\) ^) .

   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] (^Dr. Hewet^) , what you say now, or what you  #

tryed; if you plead to matter of fact, what you say to the Court as  #
to matter of Law,
we shal be ready to heare it, apply your selfe to the Court in       #
matter of fact. The
Court asks you whether guilty or not.

   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] (^Dr. Hewet^) , you have offered very much     #
touching the jurisdiction of the

you know the
danger if you doe not plead being required; you stand mute and doe   #
not plead, it
is as equally dangerous to you as if you had confessed the crimes.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^I am so highly sensible of the priviledges of an     #
Englishman, that both for the
satisfaction of my own conscience, and all persons, that I would not #
willingly give up the

demands it; I am very
loth that there should be any just imputation laid upon me, that I   #
should seek a disturbance
in point of selfe-interest to divide my selfe from the Communion of  #
those that are my
fellow-freemen; and I should, as I have always abhor'd to be both a  #
Schismatick from the
Church, and singular from the State. My Lord, I am so concerned for  #
the priviledges
of an English freeman, and publick interest, that I should be loth   #
to doe any thing towards
the giving them up, that might make my heart ake. I shall desire it  #

the Judges.^)
   [$ (^L. Presid.^) $] You speak of common friendship; what is      #
common friendship, but to be
a friend to the publick Government? if you have been a friend to the
Government and peace of this Nation, you need not fear to plead to   #
the Indictment: And
therefore I require you to plead to it.
   [$Dr. Hewet.$] (^When ever you shall come to a particular         #
Examination of the business,
it will not appear that I have been an Enemy; I desire that whereas  #

not be any advantage taken.^)

   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, I think I have not spoken any thing         #

   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] If you please, the Dr. knows that there must #
be a Judgment in
which we must acquiesce: This is that Judicature that calls you      #
before them; you
sit by the highest Authority of (^England^) , an Act of Parliament   #
in the first place, a
Commission under the great Seal in the second place, and a           #
Commission of his
Highness, against whom, of which the Doctor is one; I desire he may  #
give an
Answer to the Impeachment, that being done, we shall have liberty on #
both sides to
speak to what is Justice, and Law, and Fact; if you are not guilty,  #
be you assured that
this Court will not take your blood upon them, you have a very fair  #
Court.
   [$Dr H.$] (^This learned person speaks very fairly, It shall be   #

appear to me

determine concerning the
matters of which I am charged; I referre it, and appeal again and    #
again to the learned 
Judges of the Laws, even his Highness Judges.^)
   [$ (^L. Presid.^) $] (^Dr. H.^) The Court hath had much patience  #
in hearing of you thus long,
you having not so much as owned their Authority; if you will not own #
us, we
will own you; therefore I require the Clerk to enter it, that we     #
have required
you to plead.
   [$ (^Mr. Phelps Cl.^) $] (^John Hewet^) , you here stand charged  #

demand of you whether guilty or not guilty.

   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] My Lord, you was pleased to tell the Doctor, #
that you will own him
when he doth not own you, but, my Lord, his flying in your faces,    #
and taxing you
this is not to be endured; I wish he would have that consideration   #
of himself, that
if he doth not own your Authority, you expect to be owned, and by it #
he will be
supposed to be guilty of all those Crimes that are laid to his       #
charge, and by not
pleading he doth confess them; that will be an high scandal to Mr.   #
Doctor; Therefore
to vindicate your self, I desire you to answer.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^This learned Gent. hath urged it with a great deal   #
of civility and respect to
me, which I must own and thankfully acknowledge; but (my Lord)       #
withal, I dare not

others, by my Precedent,
that might likewise be involved in the same condition that I am in;  #
therefore (my Lord) let
it appear that it is a lawful Judicature, and I have done.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] I beseech Mr. Doctor to consider his case,   #
he is not brought as a
Champion for the people of (^England^) , as he stands charged he     #
appears to you to be
contrary affected; I humbly beg that he would be pleased to plead,   #
that so his
innocency may be clear'd.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, I said before that I am no Lawyer, I        #

   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] My Lord, some of his own Coat have           #
acknowledged the like
Authority before him; but if Mr. Doctor be peremptory in this that   #
he will not own your
Authority, and plead to his charge, I must do my duty, that is,      #
humbly to pray the
Court, that if he refuse to answer, I must pray their Judgment, and  #
acquaint him
with the words of the Act; [$which accordingly was read.$] So that,  #
my Lord, in
default of Answer, if Mr. Doctor will not plead to this, my Lord I   #
must thereupon
pray that you will proceed according to the Act, as in cases of High #
Treason
which is very penal. I have no more to say.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, I suppose these learned Gent. who are so    #

in doing any thing
that is contrary to Law^) .
   [$L. (^Presid.^) $] (^Dr. H.^) , you have heard the Clause of the #
Act of Parliament read to you,
whereby you may understand, either we must proceed upon your Answer, #
or else to
Judgment upon your refusal; if upon your answer you clear your       #
innocency, then
those freemen that you speak of may faithfully embrace you; but if   #
you will not
answer, we must proceed to Judgment; I am sorry for your Robe sake,  #
but if you
will not answer, you cannot acquit your self, you thereby confess    #
it: therefore
let me advise you for your Robe sake to follow the best Counsel,     #
that is, to put your
<P B3V>
self upon that which Prisoners must do: Answer to it, guilty or not  #
guilty.

Court that they should proceed
against me, either to sentence or any other way, till first they     #
clear themselves to me.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] Pray who is the Judge? you must clear your   #
self to him.
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] If there be any here that are of another       #
opinion, let him declare
himself: (^Dr. H.^) you lose your self mightily in saying this one   #
thing so often, and we
lose our time; I require you again to plead.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, I cannot speak of that too often that is so #
dear and precious to me and
every person.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] I can say no more but pray your justice.
   [$ (^L. Presid.^) $] Doctor (^Hewet^) , I am called upon by the   #
Court, because of your refusal to
answer, but I pity you very much, and therefore desire once more the #
patience
and favour of the Court, that they would give you leave to answer;   #
therefore Mr.
Doctor, that we may not record your standing mute and refusing to    #
answer, I shall
once more in favour to you require you to answer. Clerk, stay your   #
hand a while.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, both the Court and all these persons will   #
thus clear me to the whole

therefore I must proceed
to some other thing seeing you all deny me that.^)
   [$ (^Mr. Phelpes Cl.^) $] (^J. Hewet D. D.^) you stand here       #
charged on behalf of his

Common-wealth, you have
heard the Charge, the Court hath several times demanded your answer, #
and you
refuse; they the third time require your answer whether guilty or    #
not guilty.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^Pray my Lord is there any Indictment found against   #
me by a Grand Jury, by
which I am to be tryed? for by the fifth and sixth of^) Edward (^the #
sixt, all Treasons are to
be inquired into and presented by twelve men; the Commission by      #
which you sit doth not
declare any other way: I beseech you is there any other Indictment^) ?
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] You have a very great Grand Jury, forty        #
persons, and we have power upon
a special Act of Parliament to give order for a Charge to be brought #
in against you,
and we have according to that power and Authority given order for    #
this Charge to
be brought in against you, and you are to answer to it.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, with submission you are not a competent     #
Jury.^) 
   [$ (^Mr. Attorney Gen.^) $] My Lord, now it is the second part to #
the same tune; I know
there are many others upon the same string when this is resolved;    #
Sir, This is the
Grand Jury, the Petty Jury, and your Judge; they require you to give #
your Answer,
whether guilty or not guilty.
   [$D. H.$] (^My Lord, this is likewise denyed me, I now humbly     #
crave a copy of my Charge,
time to answer to it, and Counsel assigned me.^)
   [$ (^L. Presid.^) $] For the copy of your Charge it was never     #
granted to any Prisoner
indicted for High Treason; For Counsel, you are now upon matter of   #
Fact,
whether guilty or not guilty.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. G.^) $] I have a word to inform him, I would not    #
press any thing
against him which in my Judgment I thought not legal, you have given #
him your
resolution as to the Jurisdiction, there is nothing now to say but   #
guilty or not
guilty; he must bring himself to be a party or else nothing can be   #
asked.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^I think the Prisoner cannot be charged and tryed on  #
one and the same day, no
more than a man can be endicted and tryed the same day, as in^)      #
Calway's (^Reports: and
this was declared to be Law in the Case of the^) Portugal            #
(^Embassador's Brother^) .
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] You are not upon your Triall, you must plead #
and joyn issue, and then
we will consider whether we will try you now or no; Yet there is     #
many a man hath
been brought to prison the same day, found the same day, and tryed   #
the same day.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^I desire a copy of my charge, if not that, I desire  #
time to speake, and
Councell assigned me, which hath been the course of former times;    #
for Counsell it hath been

usually allowed, as in the case of^) Humphry Stafford (^in the time  #

to be allowed, as in my Lord^) Cook -- (^and^) Dyer (^sixth book of  #
his Reports, 14^) fol. (^is
of the same opinion^) : Arundell (^had Counsel assigned him for      #
murder, in matter of
Law^) .
   [$Sol. (^Ellis.^) $] For matter of fact it was never allowed; but #
if he plead, and if any
matter of Law doe arise, that's doubtfull to the Court, then the     #
Court if they
doubt of it, assigne Counsell; but the prisoner must plead first to  #
the
matter of fact. For a man to be accused the same day, and tryed the  #
same day, is no
new thing: For Counsell, if any thing arise in matter of Law then it #
may be
considered: The (^Portugal^) Embass. Brother came, and was accused   #
and tryed the same day.
We shall humbly pray that he may plead guilty or not guilty; if any  #
matter of
Law arise your Lordships may doe him justice.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, with submission, this learned Gent. hath    #
understood me but in part;
my request was for Counsell for matter of Law in generall, as well   #
as particular for
matter of fact. I humbly conceive that there are severall Acts of    #
Parliament that doe
free me from this charge, and particularly the great Charter of^)    #
England; (^for which I
humbly crave I may have Counsell assigned me^) .
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] You are now in generals, you speak of several  #
Acts of Parliament, and you
would have Counsel to plead, Counsel was never allowed in this case  #
upon such a
general desire; Many that stand about you may have a prejudice to    #
you, and think
you are loth to plead; I have called upon you often: if we should    #
once record the
refusall, it would be very penall. I would advise you to plead to    #
the Indictment.
   [$D. H.$] (^My Lord, since you have denyed me Counsell, I shall   #
desire to speake something
in my own behalfe.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G^) $] This is a very ill President to the justice   #
of (^England^) ; I suppose that you
will allow him all favour, but the justice of (^England^) must be    #
prefer'd against all 
persons whatsoever: The jurisdiction is setled to the satisfaction   #
of the Dr. 
himselfe; if he will bring himselfe a party and aske any thing of    #
you, that must be by
pleading, till then he can aske nothing.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, the Judicature is not yet clear'd to me,    #
for the legality of it,
and if you please to give a little patience I shall give you the     #
reasons why.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] I shall desire it may be no more thus.
   [$ (^Pre.^) $] I shall say no more to you, we must make our       #
Authority appear to you
either by trying of you, or judging of you; will you be try'd?
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, the Charge depends upon an Act of           #
Parliament which was made
about two years since, the Members of which Parliament were chosen   #

notwithstanding one hundred and fifty of them were not permitted to  #
sit --^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] My Lord we must not suffer this, pray if he  #
will not be otherwise satisfied
I must require your strict justice. Your words they are seditious:   #
this shews the
spirit of the man.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^I hope you will have patience to heare me for        #
vindication of my selfe,

withall, for the
clearing of your selves that you doe not bring blood upon your       #
selves by taking that
power that is not justifiable --^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] Truly my Lord this is insufferable; Mr.      #

as ever any had. I have attended many, I never saw the like in my    #

had the patience to heare him oppose your selves, your Authority,    #
your persons,
and to strike at the root of all. Mr. Doctor I would have you to     #
carry your selfe
with more respect. This shews that much of what is charged against   #
him is true: If
you will scorn the Court say it positively.
   [$Dr. H.$] (^My Lord, I humbly submit my selfe to the Laws of the #

fall into the same condemnation. There was one but a little before   #
you that
demanded the same thing, and the Court hath ruled it otherwise, and  #
he hath
received his Sentence. I tell you of it that you may beware, and     #
know how to carry
your self. If Mr. (^Mordant^) will be pleased to answer whether or   #
no guilty of those
Crimes, then he shall have a fair Trial, and full Examination: If    #
otherwise, the

the Judgement
pronounced for High Treason.

these things were urged by Dr. (^Hewet^) , and the Court hath ruled  #
that their
Authority is sufficient, and therefore my Lord be pleased that this  #
Gent. may plead.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^I am overborn both for Jury and Counsel, I     #
desire that my reason may
be convinced, if this Counsel will give it under their hands that    #
this is Law by the Act
of 1656. if you will say under your hands that this is Law that I    #
must be excluded of
Jury and Counsel, and that I must not know the Commission by which I #
am tryed, I will
proceed.^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] I am afraid you have received ill advise from   #
others, possibly you know
what is become of that Prisoner that spake of Counsel; we cannot     #
assign you
Counsel as to matter of Fact; the Law and Act of Parliament have     #
made us your
Judges, and therefore you are to plead.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^My Lord, I desire that that Act may be read to #
know whether I am to
be excluded of Jury and Counsel; I referre it to this Counsel.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] I doubt the Gent. is in jest, we are here to #
attend by command of his
Highness the L. Protector; these Gent. are all sworn by Act of       #
Parliament: it is a
little slighting of the Court, to appeal from the Court to the       #
Counsel; but (my
Lord) I beseech you he may forbear to say he is overborn. You shall  #
have Justice
done if you will plead, if not there was a President but now; if you #
please to put
your self upon the Trial, you shall have a fair Trial.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^My Lord, convince me by this Act that I am to  #
lose the right of Jury;
I have not heard any reason why I must lose it.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] I do tell you the Court hath given Judgment  #
just now in the like
case.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^I ask a President for this.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] I tell you a President, Sir (^H. Slingsby^)  #
and Dr. (^Hewet^) .
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^Is it a good President? if any give an ill     #
president, it is reason I should
debate it my self.^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] I humbly conceive that this Court is your    #
Court, and you ought
to plead it.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^My Lord, I desire I may be heard; the words    #
are, that the respective
Commissioners, or the major part of them, are to meet, &c. I humbly  #
conceive without the
whole I cannot be tryed.^)
   [$L. (^President.^) $] All this that you ask of us now we have    #
declared this morning
already to one who was before you at the Bar; the (^ (\Quorum\) ^)   #
of this Commission is
seventeen or any more of them: we must require you again to plead.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^My Lord, I desire a little patience, the       #
number of the Commissioners is
seventeen, I conceive that must be very much strained in reason that #
they must try,
because it relates to the respective Commissioners; several persons  #
were allowed Counsel,
I humbly desire Counsel.^)
   [$L. (^President.^) $] That is when there is matter of Law, you   #
have alledged nothing,
you are now upon matter of Fact.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^My Lord, my Indictment is matter of Law, and   #
upon that I may safely
demand Counsel, I desire to have Counsel as to my Indictment.^)
   [$L. (^President.^) $] Your reason and my reason and all reason   #
must submit to the Law:
you are now upon matter of Fact, the single question is, guilty or   #
not guilty.
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] My advise to you is, that you would put your #
self upon your
Tryal.
<P C2V>
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^I am not convinced at all, but forced upon it, #
and it is a hard thing; it is
reason that my reason should be convinced, if this Act doth say in   #
any place that I must
lose those priviledges, or if the Judges will declare it to be so, I #
will submit to it; if
the Judges will declare that I must be tryed thus, God's will be     #
done, I desire to stand
and fall by the Laws.^)
[^SOL. ELLIS'S SPEECH OMITTED.^]
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^I do not shun to be tryed by the Act of        #
Parliament, but referre my selfe to
the Judges, that those priviledges of the Act may not be taken from  #
me,^)
   [$ (^Mr. At. G.^) $] The Parliament hath thought fit to go this   #
way, and it is not to be
disputed, they that live in this nation are not to dispute it: if    #
that Gent. will please
to recollect himself, and not (my Lord) thus expostulate and dispute #
with the
Court of Justice, if he please to put himself upon a Tryal, if he    #
thinks himself
innocent, I think it is best; and if he refuse it, his sentence is   #
from himself.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^I do not (my Lord) dispute the power of the    #
Court, but I desire my
reason may be convinced, and that I may have Counsel.^)
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] We are clearly of opinion, we have not power   #
in this case to appoint
any other Jury, not to summon a Jury, we our selves have taken an    #
oath; you would
do well to plead.
   [$Mr.Mordant.$] (^My Lord, I have but little to say, and that is, #
that as that Gent. said,
it was referred to the Court what Jury I shall have, I desire (my    #
Lord) to know
whether the Court doth intend to try me by a Jury.^)
   [$Mr. (^Sol. Ellis.^) $] They do not.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^Is the Court Judge and Jury?^)
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] If you will deal ingenuously with the Court,  #
I think that is best.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^Seeing I am here overuled, though not          #
convinced in my reason, I shall
demur to the Court, and plead not Guilty. I desire a Copy of my      #
indictment, and time
to plead.^)
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] It was never done; for any Indictment of High   #
Treason was never
delivered to any Prisoner.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^I urge my Lord^) Cooke (^for Authority, for a  #
copy of my Indictment^) .
   [$Mr. (^Phelphs^) $] (^John Mordant Esquire^) , you stand here    #
charged of High Treason;
to this charge you plead not guilty, is this your Plea?
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^Yes.^)
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^I beg (my Lord) that my ignorance of the Laws  #
may not prejudice
<P C3R>
me, not understanding or knowing any thing of the Law; and this      #
granted me, I shall
address to my justification.^)
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] Do you stand to your Plea not guilty?
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^Yes.^)
[^MR. LITCHMORE'S SPEECH OMITTED. THE CHARGE REPEATED AND WITNESSES 
CALLED.^]
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] I wish Mr. (^Mordant^) had done this before,  #
and made himself capable
of more favour.
[$Mr. (^Mordant then desired to have Pen, Ink and Paper, which was   #
granted him.^)
(^John Stapley^) and (^Anthony Stapley^) were then called.$]
[$ (^John Stapley^) sworne.$] 
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] We produce this Gent. (I suppose he is well   #
known to the Prisoner)
to prove the Charge; I desire he may declare what he knows.
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] What do you know concerning the discourses of #
Mr. (^Mordant^) with
you, touching the bringing in of (^Charles Stuart^) ?
   [$ (^John Stapley.^) $] I have been in Mr. (^Mordants^) company   #
several times, and
what I can say will not be much; Mr. (^Mordant^) did once tell me    #
there was such a
design as the bringing in of the King, and he did ask me if I did    #
not know of such
a thing; I told him no; he was pleased to tell me somewhat of it: I  #
asked him
if he was engaged in it; he told me he was not.
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] What did he tell you concerning his being     #
entrusted by the King
therein?
   [$ (^John Stapley.^) $] He told me the King wrote to him, to      #
speak to his friends that
they would be ready to assist him when he should come into           #
(^England^) with force,
which he told me was with 7000 men; this was the chief of all.
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] Did he not say that he had Commissions from   #
the King?
   [$ (^John Stapley.^) $] He did not tell me so, but I have heard   #
him say others had
had Commissions, two other Gent. in (^Surrey^) .
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] Did he not encourage you thereto? what        #
Arguments did he use?
   [$ (^John Stapley,^) $] He spoke to me of it several times.
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] After what manner?
   [$ (^J. Stapley.^) $] Onely in commendation of the thing; I heard #
him say that if there
were a necessity, (^Surry^) folks would come into (^Sussex^) to      #
assist them.
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] Who was present at any of these discourses?
   [$ (^J. Stapley.^) $] There was none but him and my self.
   [$Mr. (^At. G.^) $] At what place, and at what time?
   [$ (^J. Stapley.^) $] Near his own house at several times; I have #
told you the main of
the discourses.
<P C3V>
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] Mr. (^Stapley, about what time was this^) ?
   [$ (^J. Stapley.^) $] Above a year since.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] Mr. (^Stapley, at what place was the             #
encouragement made^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Stap.^) $] I do not know what he means by Encouragement,  #
he onely told me
of it.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^I desire to know when I told you that I had    #
received a Letter to
encourage my friends from beyond Sea, and who was by.^)
   [$Mr. (^Stap.^) $] There was no body by.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] About what time did he tell you of this Letter?
   [$Mr. (^Stap.^) $] About half a year since.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Who was by?
   [$Mr. (^Stap.^) $] No body my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Sol. Ellis.^) $] Did he tell you it was the King that     #
wrote to him, and therefore
it was just to assist him.
   [$Mr. (^Stap.^) $] I think I heard him say so, I cannot take my   #
Oath of it.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Did he tell you what considerable persons were  #
concerned?
   [$Mr. (^Stap.^) $] I have heard him speak of some persons that    #
were ingaged in this
design, Sir (^Fran. Vincent^) , and one (^Brown^) ; he said that Sir #
(^Will. Waller^) spake to him
to speak to me.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] When?
   [$Mr. (^Stap.^) $] Above a year since, it was since the Parliament.
   [$Mr. Mordant.$] (^My Lord, I do not know Sir^) W. Waller.
