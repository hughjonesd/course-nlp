COMMUNION.}]

   [$ (^Question.^) $]
VVhat dooe you 
come to receiue.
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
   The holie 
Sacrament of 
the bodie and 
bloud of Christ.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
Why doest thou come to receiue it?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
Because Christ hath so commaunded 
mee.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
Of how many partes doeth it consist?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
Of two partes: namely, the outward
signe, and the inward thing signified.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
<P A2V>
Whiche bee the outwarde signes in 
this Sacrament?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
Bread and Wine.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
Whiche be the inward thinges 
signified?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
Christes bodie broken for me, and his
bloud shed for me, together with all 
the benefites of his Passion.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
How doest thou receiue the outward
signes?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
I receiue them with my hande, eate
them with my mouthe, and digeste
them with my stomacke.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
How dooest thou receiue the inward 
thynges signified?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
Onely by faithe, and feede of it as of a
foode, giuen to me to life euerlasting.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
<P A3R>
Why did GOD choose these 
Creatures of Bread and Wine, too 
represent vnto vs the body and bloud 
of Christe, rather then any other 
earthly creature?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
Because there are none earthly
creatures, that can so aptly represente 
vntoo our outwarde senses, those 
thynges that God would haue vs 
to learne by this Sacrament.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
What be those thinges which GOD 
would haue vs too learne by this 
Sacrament?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
By the breakyng of the Bread, wee
haue to learne the breakyng of the 
bodie of Christe vppon the Crosse:
and by the powryng forthe of the 
Wine, the sheadyng of his bloud, 
and by the distributyng too all that 
are presente, Christes 
communicatyng hym selfe vntoo all those that 
will faithfullie receiue hym: by the 
<P A3V>
eatyng and drinkyng wee learne, 
that as Bread and Wine doe 
nourishe our bodies in this life, so
Christes bodie and bloud doe 
nourishe our soules to life euerlastyng. 
And as the substance of Bread and 
Wine by digestion [^SOURCE TEXT: digestiou^] , passeth into the 
substaunce of our bodies, euen so by 
faithe, Christe and wee are vnited 
with an vnspeakable vnion, and
we made fleshe of his fleshe, and bones of
his bones.
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
What more is to be learned hereby?
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
That we beyng many, are made one
in Christe, as of many graines is
made one Lofe, and of many 
Grapes, one Wine,
   [$ (^Question.^) $] 
   Forasmuche as the vnworthie 
receiuer is dampned (for so Saincte 
Paule testifieth) how wilt thou know
whether thou art a worthie receiuer 
or no?
<P A4R>
   [$ (^Answere.^) $] 
   If I examine mee selfe, and finde,
that I humblie acknowledge myne 
owne vnwoorthinesse, that is to saie, 
my sinnes, and to bee hartely sorie for 
them, and fullie too purpose 
amendement of life, and faithfullie to embrace 
Gods promisse of remission [^SOURCE TEXT: remisson^] and 
Pardon offered in Christe, then am I 
worthie, because my 
vnwoorthinesse is forgiuen mee, 
and putte out of
rememberance.
