   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] My Lord, We will call our Witnesses. Set  #
up Mr. (^Smith^) .
[$ (^Then^) Joseph Smith (^was sworn^) .$]
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] You was sent, I think, as a Messenger to  #
(^Francia's^) House: Pray
give an Account of every Thing that passed there. 
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] My Lord, I have the Honour to serve His       #
Majesty as one of His
Messengers: I was appointed to attend the Secretaries Office that    #
Day, being
my Day of waiting, which was (^September^) 19. 1715. I had a Warrant #
delivered to
me against Mr. (^Francia^) , but it being late I did not go to       #
execute it that Night. The
next Day I went to his House, in (^Plow-Yard^) , in                  #               
(^Fetter-Lane^) ; Mr. (^Wilcox^) , another
Messenger, went with me, and went into the House first; he went up   #
one Pair
of Stairs and I staid below, and after he had been up a little Time, #
he called me up,
and told me there was the Prisoner: He was then in Bed, and there    #
was a Woman
with him he called Wife: We told him, we had a Warrant against him   #
for High
Treason, and bad him get up. I asked him if he had any Closet?       # 
And looking
about, I saw one by the Fire-Place: I opened it, and the first Thing #
I observed
over against the Closet-Door, upon a Shelf, was a Parcel of Letters  #
lying open
in (^Folio^) ; I saw they were in (^French^) , and directed to the   #
Prisoner, and upon the
Desk there lay a Paper-Book.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Look upon this Book; Is this the Book?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] This is the Book; it lay upon the Desk, and I #
looked into it,
and observed this Writing at the one End of it: He said it was his   #
Son's Writing,
and then I shut it again. I opened the Desk, and looked over the     #
Papers; I
<P 12>
found there several other Papers and Letters folded up: I took them  #
out, and laid
them upon the Desk by the others. Then I searcht the other Parts of  #
the
Closet, and laid all the Papers by the other Letters. I desired then #
to go up Stairs, and I
did so: And a Person I saw just now in Court, his Son, went with me; #
and I
searched the Rooms and Boxes, and found several other Papers, and    #
brought
them down into the Chamber where the Prisoner was, with Mr.          #
(^Wilcox^) ; I put
up all the Papers together, and said I had taken all Things that I   #
thought
necessary, and desired to be going. The Prisoner desired to stay and #
drink some
Coffee; we did so, and then brought him down to a House at           #
(^Westminster^) . We
carried the Papers to the Office, and delivered them to Mr.          #
(^Horatio Walpole^) . When
I was in the Chamber with him, he seemed to be under a Concern when  #
I put
up the Book; and I asked him what that Book was? He said it was the  #
Book of
his Correspondence abroad.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Is this the Book?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] You say you saw several Letters there, did #
you look into
them?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] I saw they were directed to (^Francia^) :     #
There was a Parcel that lay
open in (^Folio^) ; and others that lay folded up in the Desk.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What became of the Book and Papers after   #
you had them?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] We went with them and the Prisoner, and       #
delivered the Prisoner
into a House at (^Westminster^) ; and then went to the Office, and   #
staid till Mr.
(^Walpole^) came, and then delivered the Book and Papers to him.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you deliver any Papers to him but what #
were seized there?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What is become of Mr. (^Wilcox^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] He is Dead.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] What was it that the Prisoner said about the #
Book?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] He said, That is my Copy-Book of my           #
Correspondence abroad,
it signifies nothing. I afterwards observed some more Concern than   #
ordinary in
him; and he said to me again, the Copy-Book of my Letters signifies  #
nothing.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] How long had you the Book and Letters in your  #
Custody?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] I received them about Six or Seven a-Clock,   #
and I delivered them
the same Day to Mr. (^Horatio Walpole^) .
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] How can you be sure this is the Book?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] Because I never parted with it.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Was it not out of your Possession when   #
you delivered it into
the Office?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] Yes then it was.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did you set any Mark upon the Book?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did he say that which was wrote in it,   #
was wrote in it by him?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] He said, this is my Copy-Book of my Letters   #
to my
Correspondents abroad.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] But how can you be sure this is the same #
Book?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] I made a Remark of this Writing as he sat     #
dressing himself. [^FOOTNOTE IN SOURCE TEXT EXPLAINS "this Writing" 
TO BE "George Francia's Name in large Church Text, at the End of the
Book".^] 
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Who was it that carried the Book and Papers   #
to the Office, you or
(^Wilcox^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] I my self.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I know that to be false. How soon did you go  #
out of Town after
you had lodged me?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] In a Day or Two.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you not go that Moment?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] No: Not that Day.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] To whom did you deliver them?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] To Mr. (^Horatio Walpole^) .
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you take no more Books?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] There were several Books in your House, but I #
don't remember
that I carried any of them away but this. 
<P 13>
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did the Prisoner own to you, that the    #
Letters wrote in that
Book were wrote by him?
   [$Mr. (^Smith.^) $] He said, that is the Copy-Book of my Letter   #
to my
Correspondents abroad.
[$Then Mr. (^Horatio Walpole^) was sworn.$]
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] Pray Sir, will you give the Court and    #
the Jury an Account of this
Book and those Letters; and how, and when they were brought to you?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] I remember the Warrant for Seising the      #
Prisoner was dated the 19th 
of (^Sept.^) and that the Day after Mr. (^Smith^) and Mr.            #
(^Wilcocks^) came into my Room,
and deliver'd to me a Copy-book and a Parcel of Letters, which they  #
said they
took at (^Francia's^) House. I took them and kept them by            #
themselves, to be
produc'd when my Lord (^Townshend^) should call for them. I          #
remember that Night Mr.
(^Buckley^) came into my Room, and I desir'd him to sit down and     #
look them over with
me, and accordingly, he and I look'd into them. The next Day my Lord
(^Townshend^) sent for the Prisoner, and I carry'd in the same Book  #
and Letters, and laid
them upon the Table, and particularly the Letters, they were laid    #
open, and my
Lord examin'd the Prisoner about them. They were wrote in            #
(^French^) , and directed
to the Prisoner. My Lord ask'd him whether he knew the Hand of those #
Letters,
and turn'd them all over, and shew'd him the Directions, saying, Are #
these directed
to you? He own'd it. He own'd that he receiv'd them. My Lord ask'd him  
again, Is this your Book? He answer'd, It is; some of the Letters    #
are enter'd by
me, and some by my Son.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] Were they all the same Letters that were #
brought to you by
Mr. (^Smith.^) ? 
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] The same.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] Pray look upon this Book; Is this the    #
same Book?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] I am sure this is the Book: This is the     #
same Book that (^Smith^)
deliver'd to me, and said he took it at (^Francia's^) House.
[$Then several Letters were shewn to Mr. (^Walpole^) .$]
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] I remember all these Letters to be the same #
that I receiv'd from (^Smith^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] After the Prisoner had been examin'd, what #
became of the Letters?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] I took them back again. I kept them under   #
Lock and Key, till my
Lord (^Townshend^) had occasion to use them, which was the same      #
Night that my Lord
examin'd the Prisoner; then I took them back, and I constantly kept  #
them till I
went to (^Holland^) for the (^Dutch^) Troops, and then I deliver'd   #
them to Mr. (^Buckley^) .
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] And you can swear these are the same Letters  #
that were deliver'd to you.
By what Mark? You swear very home. What mark did you put upon those
Letters, that you can swear to them?
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Pray Sir, when they were in your Custody, Are  #
you sure they were
never deliver'd out?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] I am sure.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Do you remember one (^Jones^) the Gun-maker on #
the other side the
Water, when he was under Examination? Are you sure they were not     #
deliver'd
out by Mistake to him?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] I don't know that they were.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did you put any Mark on those Letters?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] No, I put no Mark on them.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Then how can you know them to be the same?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] I perus'd them several times. I remember    #
the Hand, and Dates,
and Directions.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Then probably you remember the Number too?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] No, I don't remember the Number.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Are you sure these are all the Letters that    #
were brought to you?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] No, there are not all the Letters.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] We will now call Mr. (^Buckley^) .
[$Then Mr. (^Buckley^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray Mr. (^Buckley^) look upon this Book   #
and these Letters, and
acquaint the Court what you know of them?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] My Lord, the Day the Prisoner was seiz'd, I #
came into Mr. (^Walpole's^)
Room. He told me he had receiv'd that Book and those Letters that    #
were seis'd at
the Prisoner's House, and desir'd me to sit down and read them with  #
him. I did so.
Afterwards, when Mr. (^Walpole^) went to fetch the (^Dutch^) Troops, #
he deliver'd this
Book and these Letters into my Hand. Afterwards my Lord              #
(^Townshend^) directed me
<P 14>
to look into them, and see which contain'd Passages most Criminal,   #
and to extract
such Passages, which I did accordingly out of several of them. I     #
will look over
them again, and then I can tell you whether they are the same.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] By what Mark?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I can tell you by that which is stronger    #
than any Mark, I copy'd
Passages out of several of them.
[$Then he look'd over the Letters one by one.$]
   I had every one of these Letters from Mr. (^Walpole^) , and I     #
know it certainly; for
that from every one of these, I extracted some Passages.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Was you present at any time when the         #
Prisoner was examin'd?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I was.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Were this Book and these Letters produced to #
him at the time of
his Examination?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] He was examin'd by my Lord (^Townshend^)    #
and Mr. Secretary (^Stanhope^) ,
and I was call'd in to take his Examination in Writing, accordingly  #
I did.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Were the Book and Letters at the time of his #
Examination 
produc'd to him?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I can't say that, for I was intent on my    #
Paper, writing the
Examination, and looking upon the Prisoner, and hearing what he      #
said. When I had
written down what is in my Hand, [$ (^ (holding out the Original     #
Examination.) ^) $] I read
it over to him distinctly and audibly; and he being ask'd whether he #
was willing
to swear to it, and answering, Yes, I offer'd him his Oath: And I    #
offer'd him a
(^New Testament^) to swear on. He said he could not swear on that    #
Book. But he took
another Book out of his Pocket, and I swore him on that. I ask'd him #
whether this
was true: He said it was. Then he sign'd it; and afterwards my Lord  #
(^Townshend^)
sign'd it.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Is the Subscription of his Hand-Writing?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] It is.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] You say I took an Oath? On what Book was it?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] Indeed I don't know, I believe it was an   #
(^Hebrew^) Book; Mr.
(^Secretary Stanhope^) look'd upon it.
   [$ (^Mr. Denton.^) $] Was he examin'd at any time after?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Mr. Denton.^) $] Was you present then?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] How long were they in your Custody?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] From the time that Mr. (^Walpole^) went    #
abroad, till he came back
again, and then I deliver'd them back to him.
   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] Were they in your Custody when Mr. (^Jones^)  #
was under Examination?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] I can't tell; but I never did show them to #
him.
   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] Were they not deliver'd out on that Occasion?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] No, they were not deliver'd out by me.
   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] You say you read the Examination to him. Did  #
not he desire to
read it himself?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I don't remember it.
   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] Was he not refused to read it?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] No, upon my Soul.
   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] Was you with the (^Prisoner^) in (^Newgate^) ?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] I was with him at his own Desire;          #
otherwise I had not gone to him.
   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] Do you remember the Days?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] How often was you with him there?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] Twice.
   [$ (^Mr. Hungerford.^) $] Were there any Offers made by you to him?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] I desire you would explain yourself.
   [$ (^Mr. Hungerford.^) $] Did you make him any Offers, that upon  #
his signing any
Paper, he should have his Liberty?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Mr. Hungerford.^) $] Did you not mention to him his giving   #
Evidence against any
other Person?
   [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] No, upon my Soul.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] These Questions ought not to be ask'd. It #
is an Iniquity to
tamper with any Man; and therefore such Questions ought not to be    #
put. If you
have any Witnesses, you may examine them.
<P 15>
   [$ (^Mr. Hungerford.^) $] Then we will examine to it.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Is that the Book I swore upon? [$ (^ (shewing #
a Book he had in his Hand.) ^) $]
    [$ (^Mr. Buckley.^) $] I don't know indeed; it was such a sort   #
of Book.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] I don't take that to be material, if it   #
were the (^Alchoran^) . He had
it in his Pocket. But it is not his Oath, but his Confession that is #
material.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] [$Taking the Book into his Hands.$] I    #
understand a little (^Hebrew^) .
This is a Book to pray by, not swear by. It is a Collection of some  #
(^Jewish^)
Prayers and Rituals; I believe, taken out of (^Maimonides^) . You    #
had best send it the
Learned (^Monfalcon^) in (^Paris^) , he is compiling some critical   #
Observation upon the
(^Eastern^) Languages.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Did you put any Mark on any of those Letters?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I did on some of them.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Where are the Extracts you made out of   #
them?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I have some of them here, [$ (^ (holding    #
out some Papers.) ^) $]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What did you do with the Letters, after  #
you had made those
Extracts?
   [$Mr. (^Just. Pratt.^) $] He tells you that he kept them till Mr. #
(^Walpole^) came back again,
and then deliver'd them to him.
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] Here is my Name on some of them. The two    #
initial Letters of my
Name.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] When was that Mark made upon them?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I don't justly remember.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] That might be done yesterday, or since they   #
were deliver'd out of his
Custody.
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I did it while they were in my Possession,  #
and before I deliver'd them
back again to Mr. (^Walpole^) .
[$Then the Lord (^Townshend^) was sworn.$]
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] We must desire your Lordship to inform   #
the Court, what your
Lordship knows in relation to the Prisoner at the Bar, as to the     # 
issuing out the
Warrant against him, and what happen'd afterwards.
   [$Lord (^Townshend.^) $] My Lord, having receiv'd Information     #
that there was a
Treasonable Correspondence carry'd on between the late Duke of       #
(^Ormond^) , Duke 
(^D'Aumont^) , (^Coulange^) and Mr. (^Harvey^) , in which the        #
Prisoner was concern'd, and was the
Channel in which the Correspondence was convey'd; and that the       #
Pretence of it
was a Law-Suit, but that the Design of it was in Favour of the       #
Pretender; and
that when they talk'd of the Party, the Pretender was meant; and     #
that they
expected him to be soon here. Having reason to rely on this          #
Information, I drew a
Warrant to seise the Prisoner and his Papers. I had indeed before    #
sent an Order to stop
all Letters that came from (^France^) , directed to (^Francia^) , by #
which I receiv'd a
Confirmation of the Intelligence which had been before given me.     #
Upon the issuing
out the Warrant, the Prisoner was seis'd, and his Letters were       #
brought to (^Mr. Walpole^) .
   The next Day I sent for the Prisoner to be examin'd, and order'd  #
(^Mr. Walpole^) to
bring me the Papers, and sent for the Prisoner in. The Letters that  #
(^Mr. Walpole^)
brought in, were laid open upon the Table, and the Book lay by them. #
I ask'd
him whether he knew the Hand, and whether those Letters were not for #
him? He
own'd the Letters, but said he could not help what was in those      #
Letters, and that
what others wrote to him, could not make him guilty. As for what I   #
have wrote
(said he) I appeal to my Book. That is my Book, I appeal to that for #
my
Innocency. He did not appear obstinate, and I remanded him; and at   #
night I sent for
him again, and Mr. Secretary (^Stanhope^) was with me; I had in that #
time look'd
into more of the Letters, I saw several initial Letters of Peoples   #
Names, I ask'd
him the Meaning of them; and he gave me the Account contain'd in this 
Examination. [^A NOTE IN THE MARGIN: Referring to the Original       #
Examination.^] He seem'd in a Disposition to tell me all he knew; he #
gave me an Account 
how this Correspondence began, and was carry'd on; and then he came  #
to explain
the initial Letters that were in those Letters that were taken upon  #
him, and in
several other Letters that I had intercepted. I remanded him again   #
that Night,
having taken this Examination in my Hand.
   A second Examination was taken upon Mr. (^Harvey's^) Letter:      #
[$ (^ (which 
Examination and the Letter thereto annex'd was shewn to his          #
Lordship.) ^) $]
   This is the very Letter on which I examin'd him; he own'd to me   #
how he
came to stop the Letter, and not to forward it, and explain'd all    #
those Figures
to me very distinctly. He protested that he knew no more, and made   #
solemn
Protestations that he had said all he knew, and I was almost         #
convinc'd he had; but in
<P 16>
the Consequence, I had reason to think he had not. But these two     #
Examinations
were taken before me, one I sign'd alone, and the other Mr.          #
Secretary (^Stanhope^)
sign'd with me. As to the First, I believe Mr. Secretary             #
(^Stanhope^) was gone out of
the Room before it was sign'd.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] I desire to ask your Lordship whether    #
all the Letters that were
brought by Mr. (^Walpole^) , were laid upon the Table at the time of #
the Prisoner's
Examination.
   [$Ld. (^Townshend.^) $] All that Mr. (^Walpole^) brought me were  #
laid there, and I saw him
take them back again.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] I desire to ask your Lordship whether you      #
heard that Declaration
read over to him?
   [$Ld. (^Townshend.^) $] I dare say I did.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Did he not endeavour to excuse himself from    #
signing it, till he had
read it himself?
   [$Ld. (^Townshend.^) $] I don't remember that, I don't know that  #
he made any Difficulty
of signing it; but I am sure it could not be because he was refus'd  #
to read it.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Was not there any Reluctancy in me to sign it?
   [$Ld. (^Townshend.^) $] What do you mean? Have not I answer'd     #
that already?
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did not you offer me some Money to sign it?
   [$Ld. (^Townshend.^) $] I hope you can't say a thing of so much   #
Infamy. After he had
been examin'd, he complain'd to me of the Misery he was reduc'd to,  #
that his Wife
and Family must starve, and represented himself as if he were at     #
loss for a Supper:
I told him he had nothing to hope for, or any room to expect any     #
Favour, but by
making a clear Confession. He went on begging, and said that his     #
Wife was starving;
I do not certainly know whether it was the very Night that he sign'd #
his Confession
or not; but I am sure it was not for that, but in pure Alms, and     #
because he begg'd
so hard, I put my Hand in my Pocket, and gave him three, four, or    #
five Guineas,
I know not which, in Charity; and it was what I never could refuse   #
any Man that
apply'd to me in that manner, and begg'd so hard. He said his        #
Brother would not
look upon him, because he was taken up for High Treason, and he      #
desir'd me to
give him something in Charity, which I did.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I desire to ask you whether you ever bestow'd #
on any body else the like
Charity? Pray my Lord, name the Man under your Examination, you ever #
gave
five Guineas to before? [$ (^ (At which there being a Laugh round    #
the Court.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I must not be laugh'd out of my Life, you did #
not answer me.
   [$ (^Lord Ch. Baron.^) $] Propose your Question to the Court?
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I desire to know who he ever gave five        #
Guineas to besides me?
   [$ (^L. Ch. Baron.^) $] My Lord says it was out of Charity.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] And that he never refus'd any body under his  #
Examination the Sum of
five Guineas?
   [$ (^L. Ch. Baron.^) $] He don't say so; he says, he never could  #
refuse his Charity to
People that begg'd as you did.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I had less Need to beg than some others.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] I have but one Question more to trouble your   #
Lordship with, which
my Instructions lead me to; and that is, whether at the time when    #
this
Examination was sign'd by the Prisoner, he was not told of its being #
for some
particular Purpose, but that it should not be binding to him?
   [$Ld. (^Townshend.^) $] He did desire that it might not be made   #
use of against him; I
told him that depended on his Behaviour, if he was Ingenuous, if he  #
dealt
frankly and fairly, and declar'd all the Truth, I would do all in my #
Power that he should
have Mercy; I don't know whether it is proper to give my Reasons why #
I am
convinc'd he did not deal candidly; but on the perusal of the        #
Letters, I found he was
not a bare Conveyer of them, or came by Chance to the Knowledge of   #
what he
explain'd in them, but that he was wrote to, as one of the Managers: #
On that I
sent to him again, and told him plainly, he must know more of it. He #
stood it
out that he did not, and then I sent him to (^Newgate^) : Soon after #
he was
committed, his Wife came, as Mr. (^Buckley^) inform'd me, and        #
acquainted him that she was
perswaded, if she could see her Husband, that she could prevail with #
him to
discover the whole: On that I gave Directions to put him into the    #
Messenger's Hands
again, which was done; about a Morning or two after, one             #
(^Curtis^) , who was in the
same Messenger's House, brought a Letter to the Office, which he had #
found drop'd
by his Man's Bed-side. It was directed to his Wife, and the Subject  #
was to bid
her not afflict herself, for he found better Company in (^Newgate^)  #
than he expected,
that the better Half of them were in upon the Government Account;    #
that he had
<P 17>
said nothing of Mr. (^Harvey^) that could hurt him, nor could he;    #
that the
Government had nothing against Mr. (^Harvey^) , but a general        #
Suspicion that he was against
the Government, which three Parts in four of the Nation were; and    #
that he
himself laugh'd at any thing the Government could do against him the #
Prisoner:
When I found a Man write in his Stile, I could not but think he had  #
not dealt 
ingenuously.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I would propose to the Judgment of the   #
Court, whether it is
proper to give Evidence of the Substance of a Letter without         #
offering the Letter
it self.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Pratt.^) $] This comes in Answer to Mr. (^Ward's^)  #
Question. He ask'd my
Ld. (^Townshend^) , whether there was not some Promise that this     #
Confession should not
be made use of against the Prisoner? His Lordship gives this         #
Account, and 
justifies himself, how he came to make use of it, and gives this as  #
the Reason.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] But to give an Account of the Substance  #
of a Letter without
producing it, I apprehend, is not according to the Rules of Evidence.
   [$ (^S. J. Jekyll.^) $] If the Councel for the Prisoner desire    #
the Letter to be read, it shall be read.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Do you insist upon the Reading of it?
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] If you will read it in the proper time you may.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] If in the Course of the Evidence the     #
Letter is not read. I don't press it.
[$Then Mr. (^Horat. Walpole^) was call'd again, and the Letter was   #
shewed to him.$]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray Sir, will you give an Account what    #
you know of this Letter,
and how it came to your Hands?
   [$Mr. (^Walpole.^) $] This Letter (^Curtis^) brought to me, and I #
made this Mark on it: [^A NOTE IN THE MARGIN: Showing a Mark upon    #
the Letter.^] He
told me it was found in (^Francia's^) Chamber near his Bed-side, and #
this is the Letter.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] There is nothing prov'd yet of its being the   #
Prisoner's Hand, its
being found by his Bed-side will not affect him.
[$Then Mr. (^Buckley^) was call'd again, and the Letter was shew'd   #
to him.$] 
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Pray look upon this Paper, and tell us    #
whose Hand-writing you
take it to be?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I never did see the Prisoner write but      #
once, and that was upon my
being sent to him to take a Confession he seem'd willing to make,    #
and then I sat
by him while he was Writing.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] How long did he write then?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] About an Hour, and I read it over.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Do you believe this to be his             #
Hand-writing?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I not only saw him write then, but I have   #
read a great deal in this
Book, which Mr. (^Walpole^) told me, was taken at the Prisoner's     #
House; therefore
being used to the Writing in this Book, and to what I saw him write, #
for those
Reasons, and no other, I believe this Paper to be his Writing.
   [$Mr. (^Denton.^) $] Are not the Letters of your Name on this     #
Letter?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] Yes. When Mr. (^Walpole^) put into my       #
Hands all the Letters, my
Lord bid me single out those that were fit to be extracted, and I    #
did mark them
that were extracted, and I always kept them in my Hands, till Mr.    #
(^Walpole^) return'd,
and then I deliver'd them to him: Those Letters that I extracted, I  #
mark'd; some
other Letters that were intercepted by my Lord (^Townshend^) , I did #
not mark, because
they came to me at other times.
   [$Mr. (^Denton.^) $] Did you mark that Letter?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Can you be positive that it is the Prisoner's  #
Hand?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Do you rely on the Writing in the Book?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] By that, and by what I did see him write,   #
from thence it is that
I conclude this to be his Hand.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] He attempts to prove his Hand by two     #
Inducements, one that
he saw him write, and the other is the Book; therefore let him fix   #
on those Parts
of the Book, that he takes to be the Prisoner's Hand, and to be      #
like this Letter.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Baron.^) $] The Book is not material; it is enough    #
for a Man to say, that he
saw another write for an Hour together, and then that he believes    #
this to be his Hand.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] If that was the single Foundation, it    #
was something; but he
makes another Foundation also.
   [$Mr. Just. (^Pratt.^) $] We are going out of the way, the        #
Question is, Whether this
shall be read? In order to that, the Method is to prove, that the    #
Witness is
acquainted with the Prisoner's Hand-writing, and believes this to be #
his Writing. He
tells you he saw him write for an Hour. He gives you a further       #
Reason, that it is
<P 18>
like some Letters in the Book. If that were laid out of the Case,    #
the other would
be sufficient without it.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] A Man makes two Things the Foundation    #
of his Judgment
his Seeing him write, and the Similitude of Hands in the Book; the   #
most conclusive
Evidence would be, the Similitude of the Hand in the Book, which     #
others may
judge of as well as himself.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Baron.^) $] That is no Evidence at all; Similitude of #
Hands in no Evidence.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I am far from thinking it is, or that    #
there is as yet any Evidence
at all. Do you believe this to be his Hand, only from your having    #
seen him write,
or from what you have observ'd in the Book also?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] I say that from my having seen him write,   #
and my having seen the
Entries in the Book, I believe this to be his Hand.
   [$Mr. Just. (^Pratt.^) $] If you had never seen the Book, but had #
seen him write for an
Hour; Could you collect from thence that this was his Hand?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] No, I would not affirm it.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Then it is with us, and makes it         #
necessary to look into the Book.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] How come you to apprehend any one Part of  #
the Book to be
(^Francia's^) Writing more than the other?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] By my Eye-sight, and comparing it with this #
Letter.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Is it from your Knowledge of seeing him    #
write?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] Yes, and this Writing being like this Book.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] I desire this Matter may be consider'd   #
how it stands, my Ld.
(^Townshend^) is examin'd touching the Confession of the Prisoner,   #
and was ask'd whether
there was not hopes of Mercy given him, my Lord said there were,     #
upon his
making a frank Discovery; but he tells you the Prisoner was not      #
entituled to Mercy,
because he had not made such a Discovery, and then gives an Account  #
of this
Letter: I thought the Councel for the Prisoner appeal'd to that      #
Letter, and would have
had it produc'd, to check the Evidence given by my Lord.
   [$Mr. J. (^Pratt.^) $] Since it is gone thus far, I think it      #
would be proper to clear this Matter.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I desire to know where Mr. (^Buckley^) saw me #
write for an Hour together?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] It was in the Messenger's House.
   [$Mr. Just. (^Tracy.^) $] My Ld. (^Townshend^) was giving an      #
Account in Answer to a 
Question propos'd by the Prisoner's Councel, and gave his Reason     #
why he did not think
the Prisoner was frank. I did not think so (says he) because of a    #
Letter which
was found by his Bed-side. Says Mr. (^Hungerford^) , then that       #
Letter ought to be produc'd.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] If the Account is no more than that my   #
Lord observ'd so upon
that Letter, there is no great Harm in reading it: But I am still in #
your Judgment,
Whether, when the Contents of a Letter is insisted upon, and         #
repeated, and that
upon Memory only, the Letter it self ought not to be produc'd?
[$Then -- (^Curtis^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Look upon that Letter, Whose              #
Hand-writing is it?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] I believe it is Mr. (^Francia's^) .
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Have you seen him write?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] And do you believe it to be his Writing?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] How long have you been acquainted with the     #
Prisoner?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] While he was in the Messenger's Hands.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] How often did you see him write?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] Several times.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Was you in Custody at the same time when he was?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Where did you find this Letter?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] In his Chamber by his Bed-side.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I don't hear that he gives an Account,   # 
whether he is so well
acquainted with his Writing, that he can distinguish it from any     #
others?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] He told me it was a Letter that he had wrote to #
his Wife.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] The Letter is in (^French^) ; we have a    #
Translation of it; we must
desire that the Interpreters who translated it, may be sworn.
[$Then Mr. (^Boyer^) , and Mr. (^Ozell^) , were both sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Did you translate the Letter?
   [$Mr. (^Boyer.^) $] I did, and afterwards I compar'd it with Mr.  #
(^Ozell^) .
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Is that a true Translation of the original   #
Letter?
   [$Mr. (^Boyer.^) $] I did make a true Genuine Translation of it,  #
allowing for the
difference of Language and Stile.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Was it the best and most exact Translation   #
you was able to make?
   [$Mr. (^Boyer.^) $] Yes.
<P 19>
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Mr. (^Ozell^) , Have you compar'd this       #
Translation with the Original?
   [$Mr. (^Ozell^) $] Yes, and I believe it to be a true Translation.
   [$ (^Note.^) That the Original Letter was deliver'd into the      #
Prisoner's Hand, during
the time that the Translation was Reading; and Mr. (^Flint^) , who   #
was permitted to
stand in the Bar near the Prisoner, assisted him in Comparing the    #
Original with the
Translation. The like Method was observ'd, when the Translations of  #
the Letters
receiv'd by the Prisoner, were read; and when the Letters wrote by   #
him were read
out of the Copy-Book, the Copy-Book was shown to him.$]
   [$Clerk reads.$] [^LETTER OMITTED.^]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Pray let me have the Letter; I have a    #
little (^French^) , and I
would willingly see how they would render the Word (^Tories^) .
   [$Mr. J. (^Pratt.^) $] When did you find this Letter?
   [$ (^Curtis.^) $] Upon the (^27th^) Day of (^November^) .
[^NO ITALICS FOR 27 IN SOURCE TEXT.^]
   [$ (^Mr. Soll. Gen.^) $] My Lord (^Townshend^) , Pray be pleas'd  #
to give an Account of the
Occasion that this Confession was not sign'd by both the Secretaries?
   [$Ld. (^Townshend.^) $] I suppose Mr. Secretary (^Stanhope^)      #
might be gone out of the Room.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I would not willingly trouble my Ld.     #
(^Townshend^) at any other
time, and therefore would take this Opportunity: I think your        #
Lordship said, that
the Letters that were stop'd at the (^Post-Office^) , were laid on   #
the Table with the
other Letters, when the Prisoner was examin'd?
   [$Ld. (^Townshend.^) $] I did not say that. The Letters that were #
intercepted, I did first lay
them before the King, and then put them into the same Hands with the #
other Letters.
[$Then Mr. Secretary (^Stanhope^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Mr. Secretary (^Stanhope^) , we must       #
desire you to inform the Jury what
you know about the Examinations of the Prisoner, and the Confession  #
he made?
   [$Mr. (^Secret. Stanhope.^) $] I have here two Examinations; one  #
sign'd by my Ld.
(^Townshend^) , the (^21st.^) of (^Sept.^) and the other dated the   #
(^22d.^) of (^Sept.^) sign'd by my Ld.
(^Townshend^) and myself. [^NO ITALICS FOR 21 OR 22 IN SOURCE        #
TEXT.^] I was present at both the Examinations: There has been an
Account given of the First, which is perfectly Agreeable to what     #
pass'd there, and my
Name is to the Second.
   There is annex'd to this Second a Letter, which we take to be Mr. #
(^Harvey's^) : I
remember the Letter; the Hand is particular, and there are Figures   #
by way of Cyphers.
I remember very well this Letter. It has been before the Cabinet     #
Council. It was
shown to Mr. (^Harvey^) at the Council-Table; he did not deny it,    #
but shew'd the
utmost Consternation when it was shown to him; and desir'd that he   #
might withdraw,
and have the Liberty to speak to one particular Lord. The manner of  #
his
Behaviour was such, as to induce the Lords of the Council to be of   #
Opinion, that he was
inclin'd to confess what he knew; therefore they thought fit to let  #
him withdraw,
and go to the Messenger's House; but his Agonies were such, that he  #
stabb'd
himself that Night, or the next Morning.
   I believe at twice we spent about two Hours in the Examination of #
the Prisoner,
and these Examinations were taken from his own Mouth; and I can be   #
positive
there is not a Passage in them, that he did not repeat more than     #
once or twice. The
reason why my Name is to one, and not to the other, may be, because  #
the Room
where he was examin'd was next to the Room where the Council used to #
meet; and
I believe I might be going in and out between the two Rooms, and     #
might not be there
when he sign'd it; and therefore I might not think it proper to set  #
my Name to what
I did not see sign'd: But I saw him sign that to which my Hand is    #
set; and I don't
remember that he had any Reluctancy to sign it. I read the first     #
Examination more
than once or twice to him, and did my self examine him to all the    #
Particulars of it.
<P 20>
   After the first Night's Examination, it is certain he behav'd     #
himself like a Man
not worth a Groat, intimating as if he did not know how to get a     #
Supper: He
represented himself in a pitiful Condition, and it was at his going  #
out of the Room,
that my Lord put his Hand in his Pocket, and gave him something,     #
what it was, I
don't know, but it was after he had sign'd his Examination; for      #
after it, there was
a good deal of Conversation pass'd between him and me. I ask'd him   #
several
Questions, as to his being in (^France^) , and about the Countries   #
he came from; and ask'd
him as to several (^Spanish^) Letters that were in the Book, and     #
other things of that Nature.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Did he not desire to read over the             #
Examinations before he sign'd them?
   [$Mr. Sec. (^Stanhope.^) $] I don't remember that he did; but     #
they were read over to him,
and he was ask'd to every Particular by myself, some one Particular  #
might slip; but
I did examine him, I think, to every Particular, in order to have it #
alter'd, if he
objected to it, and he did not express the least Reluctancy. I saw   #
him set his Hand
to one of them; as to the other, I can't say, because the Room was   #
next to the
Room where the Council was sitting, and I don't know but that I      #
might be there.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Do you remember any thing particular that was  #
said to him, that those
Examinations should only be laid before his Majesty, and no other    #
use made of 'em?
   [$Mr. Secretary (^Stanhope.^) $] I don't remember any such thing.
   [$Sir (^J. Jekyll.^) $] If he had desir'd to have read these      #
Examinations, would you
have refused it?
   [$Mr. (^Secret. Stanhope.^) $] It never was deny'd to any Man to  #
read his Examination
before he sign'd it, where I was present.
   [$Sir (^J. Jekyll.^) $] Nor you would not have refus'd him, if he #
had desir'd it?
   [$Mr. (^Secretary Stanhope.^) $] No, God forbid.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I am inform'd that the Prisoner wrote    #
some Letters to my Ld.
(^Townshend^) , complaining of some other use being made of his      #
Examinations, than was design'd?
   [$Mr. (^Sec. Stanhope.^) $] I receiv'd some Letters from the      #
Prisoner, but none that I
thought were of any sort of avail.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did he complain of his not being         #
suffer'd to read them?
   [$Mr. (^Sec. Stanhope.^) $] I don't remember it; but I am sure it #
was not so. If he did
complain, it was without any ground.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I desire a Sight of the Original Letter,      #
which (^Curtis^)
said I own'd. [$ (^Which was shewn him accordingly.^) $] I never     #
wrote one Word of it; it is forg'd since:
Any body will say it; it is not like my Hand.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Before the Examinations are read, I desire   #
the Gentlemen of the
Jury would take an Account in Writing of the Initial Letters and     #
Figures they will
hear read, and then will observe who are the Persons meant and       #
intended by them,
according to the Prisoner's Explanation, when he was examin'd.       #
Gentlemen, it is
necessary you should understand, who are the Persons that are        #
intended by the Letters
and Numbers. If you take them down, all the Letters will read to the #
Purpose.
   [$Ld. (^Ch. Baron.^) $] (^Gentlemen^) , They desire you will take #
Notice of the Letters and
Numbers, that are explain'd in this Examination, because you will    #
the better
understand the Letters that will be read to you: That is what they   #
desire, and it will
be for your Satisfaction.
[^THE EXAMINATION OF FRANCIS FRANCIA OMITTED.^]

   [$ (^Sir J. Jekyll.^) $] Now we will read Mr. (^Harvey's^) Letter.

   [$ (^Mr. Ward.^) $] You cannot read that Letter against the       #

[^LETTER OMITTED.^]
<P 23>
   [$ (^Mr. Attorney-General.^) $] We will now show the Nature of    #
this Correspondence,
by their sending Letters to and again, and show when he came into it
himself.

   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Are you a going to offer any Letters?

   [$Mr. (^Attor. Gen.^) $] Yes, out of his own Book.
 
<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 29>
   [$Mr. (^Attor. General.^) $] We will read our Letters as they are #
in Time, and shew
the Nature of the Correspondence.
<P 30>
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] I am inform'd there are different Hands in     #
that Book: Now
whether your Lordship will admit them to read it under a general     #
Proof of his
owning it to be his Copy-Book, or whether you will not expect that   #
that which is
his Writing should be prov'd, and what is wrote by any other, to be  #
wrote by
his direction, or privity; for a small Variance in the Expression,   #
may turn a
Man out of his Life.

   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] All that the Witnesses said was. That    #
the Prisoner said it was
his Copy-Book. Now whether he is to be affected by every Word in that
Volume, is what we must submit to your Lordship; and whether they    #
ought not
to single out which were wrote by him, and which not; for his        #
saying that is
his Book, that is, the Volume is his, the Cover is his, and the      #
Paper is his, but
it will not imply that he is the Author of all those Letters.

   [$Sir (^J. Jekyll.^) $] My Lord, when they objected to our        #
reading the Copy-Book,
they ought to have made all their Objections together; but this      #
being in the
Case of Life, I won't stand upon that. 
   It is plain, it ought to be read; for you observe the Letters, of #
which these
are Copies, are suppos'd to be sent to (^France^) ; and it is        #
impossible to have
them; then what Certainties have we touching these Letters? We have  #
the
taking the Book in the Custody of the Prisoner, and if there had     #
been no more
then it's being found in his Custody, I apprehend we might have      #
been let in to
read 'em. But it goes a great way farther; for several of the        #
Witnesses Swear
that he own'd it was his Copy-Book of his Letters.
   Let's consider how this Evidence would have been, if it had been  #
given to
every Letter in particular. If we had produc'd one single Copy of a  #
Letter,
and he own'd that was a Copy of a Letter wrote by him, will any one  #
doubt
but that it might be read? No, the Evidence say that he own'd this   #
to be the
Copy-Book of his Letters.

   [$Mr. (^Just. Tracy.^) $] Where the Court is in no doubt, we      #
must not spend our Time
in arguing Points that have nothing in them.

   [$ (^Ld. C. Baron.^) $] It is no matter whether any of them are   #
of his Hand-writing
or not, I think they may be read.

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 45>
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] We shall leave it here, and submit it to   #
your Lordship and the
Jury, upon the Evidence we have offer'd.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] May it please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen #
of the Jury, I
am Council for the Prisoner, and what I shall humbly offer to your   #
Lordship before
we go into our Evidence, is a single Point, we shall lay before you  #
and insist upon;
a particular Circumstance in the Indictment, which is such, that     #
considering the
Circumstance of my Client, it is impossible as the Law stands, that  #
he should be
guilty in such manner as is charged in the Indictment.
   The Prisoner happens to be an Alien born, he was born at          #
(^Bordeaux^) in (^France^) ;
he came from thence into (^England^) , and never was Naturaliz'd. He #
owes therefore
no natural Allegiance, nor can be guilty of any Treason against the  #
King as his
natural Leige Lord, as its laid in this Indictment.
   There is a Distinction of a double Allegiance, one that is due    #
from a natural
born Subject, and the other that is due from an Alien. The latter    #
owes only a
local Obedience with respect to his Protection, whereas the former   #
owes it in respect
of his Birth. This is a Distinction well known in (^Calvin's^) Case. #
It appears, that
if an Indictment for Treason be against an Alien, it must be charged #
to be against
his Allegiance in general, but not against his natural Allegiance.   #
This is taken
notice of in a great many Cases. In the Reports of my Lord           #
(^Hobart^) , (^Vaughan^) , and 
(^Keyling^) , there are several Cases which show this Distinction.
   In my Lord Chief Justice (^Holts^) time, in the Trial of          #
(^Cranborn^) , and (^Lowick^) ,
(^April^) 22. 1696. an Exception was taken to the Indictment; that   #
it was not said
(^ (\Contra Naturalem Ligeantiam\) ^) ; and in that Case,            #
(^Calvin's^) Case was agreed to be Law.
<P 46>
It was held, that in case of an Alien, he ow'd only a general        #
Allegiance, and it was
agreed, that in case of an Alien, it must not be (^ (\Contra         #
naturalem ligeantiam\) ^) ; and my
Lord Cheif Justice (^Holt^) says, if it were so, it would be ill.    #
And it may be given
in Evidence, that he is an Alien, in order to acquit him of a Crime, #
charg'd to be
against his natural Allegiance; there is none such due.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] My Lord, The Objection is founded on a   #
Fact. If the Fact is
admitted, we will argue upon it; if not, we will call some Witnesses #
to prove it.
[$Then (^Simon Francia^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Pray give an Account what you know of    #
the Prisoner, what
Country Man he is, and where he was born?
   [$ (^Simon Francia.^) $] He is my Brother, he was born in         #
(^France^) at (^Bourdeaux^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Are you Elder or Younger than he?
   [$ (^Simon Francia.^) $] I am Four Years Elder.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] How then can you remember what was done    #
when you was Four
Years old?
   [$ (^Simon Francia.^) $] I can't remember the Day of his Birth,   #
but I was bred up with
him at (^Bourdeaux^) , we were all born in the same House.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What Age was you of when you first       #
remember him?
   [$ (^Simon Francia.^) $] I remember him when I was about Six      #
Years old.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] And you don't remember that your Father  #
and Mother came
to (^England^) in that time?
   [$ (^Simon Francia.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did your Father and Mother live at       #
(^Bourdeaux^) when you was
about Six Years old?
   [$ (^Simon Francia.^) $] Yes.
[$ (^Then^) Jaques Gonsales (^was sworn on the Books of^) Moses.
(^And an Interpreter was sworn, because the Witness spoke^)
English (^very imperfectly^) .$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Pray give an Account what Countryman the #
Prisoner is, and
where he was born?
   [$ (^Gonsales.^) $] The Prisoner is the Son of (^George           #
Francia^) , and (^Mary Gonsales^) my
Sister. He was born at (^Bourdeaux^) the 26th of (^March, New        #
Stile^) 1675.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyl.^) $] How do you know he was born there?
   [$ (^Gonsales.^) $] Because I was present when he was born. My    #
House was over-against
my Sister's, who was the Prisoners Mother; afterwards he was         #
baptized in the
Church of St. (^Andrew^) .
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] We have two or three Witnesses more, his #
Godfather and
Godmother; but I think it plainly prov'd by these Witnesses, so that #
we need not
go any further. Mr. (^Attorney^) , do you admit it, or shall we      #
examine more Witnesses?
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Prove what you can.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Then Mr. (^Attorney^) , you admit what   #
we contend for. I am
sure if he be a good (^Englishman^) , he cannot be a false Traytor.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] He speaks good (^English^) .
[$ (^Then^) Emes Lamira (^was sworn^) .$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Give an Account whether you know where   #
the Prisoner was
born?
   [$ (^Lamira.^) $] He was born at (^Bourdeaux^) , I liv'd there    #
when he was born.
[$Then (^Jaques Gonsales^) was call'd again.$]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] How long hath the Prisoner liv'd in        #
(^England^) ?
   [$ (^Gonsales.^) $] I can't tell positively.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] As near as you can?
   [$ (^Gonsales.^) $] I can't tell, for he has liv'd at one part of #
the Town, and I at the other.
[$Then (^Simon Francia^) was call'd again.$]
   [$ (^L. C. Baron.^) $] How long ago did your Brother come into    #
(^England^) ?
   [$ (^Simon Francia.^) $] He hath been here twice. He was here     #
about Twenty Years ago,
and this last time, he hath been here about Six or Seven Years.
   [$ (^L. C. Baron.^) $] How long did he stay when he first came?
   [$ (^Simon Francia.^) $] About Eight or Nine Years.
<P 47>
[$ (^Then^) Cecilia Ceres (^was sworn^) .$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What do you know of the Prisoner? What   #
Country Man is he?
   [$ (^Ceres.^) $] I went to School with him at (^Bourdeaux^) .
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Where was he reputed to be born?
   [$ (^Ceres.^) $] At (^Bourdeaux^) , in the same Street where I was.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] How Old was he when you knew him first?
   [$ (^Ceres.^) $] We were both Children.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I think the Place of a Man's Birth can't #
be better prov'd, it
is prov'd by some that were in the Room at his Birth, some that went #
to School
with him, and some that knew him there a Child.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] If the Jury should be satisfied with this  #
Evidence, it will not
acquit the Defendant, the Opinion in (^Cranborn's^) Case being, that #
the Word
(^Naturalem^) was not necessary to be in the Indictment; and adding  #
an immaterial Word
will not therefore make the Indictment bad. If this does not satisfy #
the
Defendant's Council, I shall insist that this Point be found         #
specially.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Pratt.^) $] If you insist that you have given a     #
sufficient Evidence to satisfy
the Jury, and indeed it is a strong Evidence, Mr. (^Attorney^) says, #
if the Evidence
is to the Satisfaction of the Jury, he is willing to find it         #
specially. Therefore are
you willing to leave it to the Jury on that single Issue?
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] That is giving up all the rest. I would  #
a little enforce and
apply this Evidence.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Pratt.^) $] I believe, if Mr. (^Attorney General^)  #
desires it to be found
specially, it was never known to be denied.
   [$Sir (^J. Jekyll.^) $] I desire it may be found specially.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I will be bold to say, this Objection is #
in all the Authorities
which we have in the Law touching this Matter, held good: A Man who  #
is not a
natural born Subject cannot owe a natural Allegiance: And it is very #
hard, that
without offering any Reason, to raise a Doubt, but upon bare asking  #
to have a
Matter found specially, it must be so.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] If you have a mind to it we will debate it #
with you now.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] With all my Heart, I am ready to speak   #
to it now.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] If we were to expect the Judgment of the #
Court upon it now,
I would debate this Matter now, and I should not doubt but to be     #
able to satisfy
the Court that the Indictment is well fram'd against the Prisoner,   #
notwithstanding
he is an Alien born.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I would be glad to hear one Authority to #
support Sir (^Joseph's^)
Opinion.
  
<S SAMPLE 4>
<P 49>
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] My Lord, I shall take up but a very      #
little of your Time
till we have gone through our Evidence, and then shall apply my self #
to
make some Remarks upon it. But in general, the Accusation contained in
this Indictment is, That this Man has conspir'd to take away the     #
Life of the
King; the Overt Acts laid are, That he conspired to levy War, and 
endeavoured to engage Assistance from abroad, and wrote Letters, and #
sent them
to divers Persons beyond Seas for that Purpose.
   Gentlemen of the Jury, I am sure you must observe, that as to a   #
direct
Proof of his intending to take away the truly precious Life of the   #
King, there
is none, but what is endeavour'd to be inferr'd from these Letters.  #
If there
were, I am sure I should not, and, I believe, none of my Profession  #
would
have spoke one Word for him. But all that is said arises from        #
himself. There
is no Consultation appears, but that this Man consulted with himself #
and his
Compting-House to take away the Life of the King. As to any of those
Letters, there is nothing in them that looks that Way. And as to     #
what is
contained in the Letters received from (^France^) , they cannot      #
affect him. All
that can be inferr'd from them is, that he was privy to what was     #
contained
in those Letters: And if that were High-Treason, yet it can only     #
amount
to Misprision of Treason in the Prisoner. You who live in this great
Trading City, the most eminent for Trade and Commerce in the World,  #
in
which, I believe, you are very much concerned, know that a great     #
Part of
the Commerce is carried on by Letters, and all or most of them are   #
entred
in Books; you must have a due Apprehension of the Consequences of    #
such
a Transaction as this is. To have a Man living in his House in Peace,
under the Protection of the King's Laws, to have his Books and       #
Papers taken
from him, and those Books and Papers turn'd against him, to the
Destruction of him and his Family.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] I desire you would forbear inveighing  #
in this Manner.
This is not a proper Manner of proceeding.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyl.^) $] You have had an Account that an           #
Information was given
to the Secretary of State, of a treasonable Correspondence carried   #
on by this
Man, and here is an Harangue complaining that his Person and Papers  #
are
seiz'd. You know if there had been an Information given to the meanest
Officer in the Kingdom, he could not have justified himself, without #
doing
the same Thing.
   [$ (^Lord. C. Baron.^) $] You are not to arraign those Proceedings.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I don't doubt but that noble Lord had    #
Grounds for what
he did, but what Grounds he had doth not appear: And surely I have a
Right to observe, that all the Evidence that appears against the     #
Prisoner,
arises from those Letters and Books that were taken away from him.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Pray Mr. (^Hungerford^) act within the #
Bounds of your
Profession.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Mr. Attorney, I am to be corrected by    #
the Court, and
not by you. I owe Duty to my Lords the Judges, and I shall always    #
pay it.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Tracy.^) $] You ought not to reflect on that        #
Matter, of seizing the
Papers.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I am not understood. I say all that is   #
offer'd against
him is from the Papers found in his Custody.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Prat.^) $] If that was all that you had said you    #
ought not to have been
interrupted, but I never knew in my Life, but what was done in this  #
Case
was ordinarily done in the like Cases, and ought to be done, and you #
ought
not to go on with Invectives to the Jury, complaining that his       #
Papers are
seiz'd, and then that those Papers are turn'd against him. When a
Correspondence is carried on by Letters, ought they not to be        #
seized, and if they
appear to be treasonable, ought they not to be kept, and made Use of #
against
him. We must not sit here to hear Invectives against Magistrates of  #
the
highest Quality, for doing that, which if they had not done, they    #
had failed
in their Duty.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I have not said any Thing to impeach the #
Legality of
what was done. All I said, and do say, is, that the Evidence is from #
the
Papers found in his own Custody.
<P 50>
   You have heard the Letters read, and you observe, That great Part #
of
them is about Dogs and Horses, and a Summ of 130 (^l.^) 4 (^s.^) and #
about a Suit
that was carrying on in the Court of Chancery. As to the Book, I shall
touch no more upon it now, but I believe we shall be able to offer   #
Proof
that there is not any Part of it wrote by himself. How that will     #
agree with
the Evidence already given, we must submit. We shall likewise give   #
some
Account of some Discourses that have been had with the Man himself.  #
And,
I believe, I need not observe to Gentlemen of your Figure and
Circumstances, That the Mr. (^Harvey^) , who is represented by the   #
King's Council, to
be the first Promoter of, and carried on this treasonable            #
Correspondence, is
at Liberty, even without a Trial; and what the Law hath done for him
without a Trial, I hope shall, by your Justice, be done for the      #
Prisoner, now
upon his Trial, that is, that he shall be acquitted.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Though it is difficult for us to be put to     #
explain any of those
Letters, yet we will call some Witnesses to explain one, which       #
mentions
Persons of 50 or 60 Thousand Crowns a Year, and shew that it was meant
of one that was concerned in the Revenue in (^France^) , and         #
suffered by it.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Prat.^) $] If you are going to explain that Letter, #
it will be
necessary to read it again to the Jury.
[$ (^Which was done accordingly.^) $]
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] We will shew it was meant of one (^George      #
Francia^) , who had
been concern'd in the Revenues in (^France^) .
[$ (^Simon Francia^) being sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did you know (^George Francia^) ?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Was he concerned in the Revenue in       #
(^France^) , and had he
any Loss there?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] Yes, he lost all he had.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] By what Occasion was it?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I don't know.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Was it by his own Management, or         #
depending on others?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I don't know, but I know he had an Estate   #
and lost it all.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] We offer this only as a Sample for the rest.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] What was this Man worth?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I computed him to be worth Eight or Ten     #
Thousand Pounds.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Doth he answer the Description in the  #
Letter of a
Person of Fifty or Sixty Thousand Crowns a Year?
   [$Sir (^J. Jekyll.^) $] Had he any Estate in Land?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] No, only in Money.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Do you know of any Offers that have been #
made, or
Threats used to the Prisoner?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I know of some.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] By whom.
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] By Mr. (^Buckley^) . That if he would swear #
against Mr. (^Harvey^)
of (^Comb^) , he should have a good Reward.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Do you know of any other?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] Yes, my Lord (^Townshend^) told me he had   #
given my Brother
five Guineas, and he would give him more if he would swear against
Mr. (^Harvey^) .
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Where did he tell you so?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] In the Office at the Cockpit.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Do you know any Thing of two Warrants    #
that Mr.
(^Buckley^) brought, one for his Releasment, and the other for his
Confinement?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I don't know any Thing of that.
<P 51>
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] How came this Discourse between my     #
Lord (^Townshend^)
and you?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I was several Times with him at the Office  #
about my Brother.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] I hope it will be proper at this Time  #
that my Lord
(^Townshend^) and Mr. (^Buckley^) , may be ask'd to this Matter.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Prat.^) $] I suppose you was present when this past #
between Mr.
(^Buckley^) and the Prisoner.
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] It was between my Lord (^Townshend^) and    #
me, and Mr. (^Buckley^)
and me.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Prat.^) $] Who else was by, besides Mr. (^Buckley^) # 
and you?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] No Body else?
   [$Mr. (^Just. Prat.^) $] Who was by, when that which you          #
mention'd, past
between my Lord (^Townshend^) and you?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] No Body else. The first Time I applied to   #
my Lord (^Townshend^) ,
I think there was another Secretary there.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Prat.^) $] But at that Time that you say this Offer #
was made,
was any Body present?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] Indeed I don't remember that there was.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] I think you say, the first Time you was with #
my Lord
(^Townshend^) , there was the other Secretary there?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] Yes, there was.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Where was this, in what Room?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] In the Cockpit.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] What is your Relation to the Prisoner?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I am his Brother.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] You say there was another Secretary by,  #
Was it the
other Secretary of State?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I know not who it was, there was another    #
Gentleman.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] He said another Secretary of State.
   [$ (^Lord C. Baron.^) $] What did my Lord (^Townshend^) say to you?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] He said he had given my Brother five        #
Guineas, and he would
give him more, if he would swear against Mr. (^Harvey^) .
   [$ (^Lord Chief Baron.^) $] You say at that Time there was        #
another Secretary?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] No, no, not at the Time of that Discourse.
   [$ (^Lord C. Baron.^) $] Nor there was no Body with you and Mr.   #
(^Buckley^) ?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] No.
[$Then (^Lucy White^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Was you by, or in hearing, when any      #
Offers were
made to the Prisoner.
   [$ (^White.^) $] Upon the Seventh of (^September^) I went to see  #
the Prisoner in
(^Newgate^) . He told me Mr. (^Buckley^) was to be there with him,   #
and desired me to
conceal my self in the Room, that I might hear what past, and I did  #
so.
When Mr. (^Buckley^) came he spoke about one (^Flint^) ; and         #
afterwards Mr.
(^Buckley^) ask'd him several Questions about Mr. (^Harvey^) . He    #
said he knew nothing
but that he was innocent. Mr. (^Buckley^) told him he must swear     #
right or
wrong for the Government; if he would not, he himself would swear    #
High
Treason against the Prisoner; for he had taken Money of my Lord
(^Townshend^) , and done nothing for it.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did you see any Thing of two Warrants    #
Mr. (^Buckley^)
had at that Time?
   [$ (^White.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did Mr. (^Buckley^) see you?
   [$ (^White.^) $] No, I conceal'd my self under the Feet of the Bed.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] You say this was the Seventh of        #
(^September^) . What Year?
   [$ (^White.^) $] In the Year 1716.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Where was he then?
   [$ (^White.^) $] In (^Newgate^) .
<P 52>
[$Then (^Mary Meggison^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Do you know of any Offers that were made #
to the 
Prisoner, and by whom?
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] Upon the Twenty Eighth of (^September^) last  #
I was in Mr.
(^Francia's^) Room, and Mr. (^Buckley^) came in and told him he      #
should be tryed
suddenly, and there were a great many Witnesses against him; and he
would swear against him, because, says he, you have cheated my Master
of Five Guineas, and won't swear against Mr. (^Harvey^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Was you in the Room then?
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] I sat upon a little Box at the Bed's Feet,    #
and it was so dark
he could not see me.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] How came you to (^Newgate^) .
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] I have been a great many times in (^Newgate^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] You dwell there sometimes, don't you?
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] No, I never did.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Are you a married Woman?
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] What is your Husband?
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] A Dealer, but he is not in (^England^) now.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] What Room was I in?
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] A little dark Room.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] What do they call it?
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] The Lions Den.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Every Body knows that Room is a dark Room,    #
that People
can't easily be seen in it.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did you hear Mr. (^Buckley^) say any     #
thing more?
   [$ (^Meggison.^) $] Nothing, but that he would bring my Lord      #
(^Townshend^) into
Court, on purpose to influence the Jury by his presence.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] As to these two Witnesses, we have       #
several to speak to
their Reputations; but I believe you have no doubt as to that.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] I dare say no one Person in Court        #
believes a Word they say.
[$Then Mr. (^Buckley^) was called again.$]
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I desire to know whether you was not with me  #
in the Lions Den.
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] My Lord, the Prisoner sent to me by         #
(^Revell^) the Turnkey,
and desired to speak with me; when I came to him, he spoke to me first
about (^Flint^) , and desired he might be released from his strait   #
Confinement; 
and then about his own Affairs. He thank'd me for my Humanity in
coming to talk with him, so we parted immediately. I told my Lord    #
(^Townshend^)
what had past; (^Flint^) had the Benefit of it. He had been confined #
close, but
(^Francia^) speaking on his behalf, he was released from that        #
Confinement; and
that was the Business I went about. The Room is a little dark Room,  #
but
if any Body had been at the foot of the Bed, I believe I might have  #
seen
them.
   [$ (^Lord C. Baron.^) $] Did you say those Words?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] No my Lord, it is impossible I should.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Not impossible surely?
   [$Mr. (^Buckley.^) $] Yes, impossible, I appeal to my Character:  #
I entirely and
utterly deny it. I desire that (^Revell^) may be called.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] We are now in our Evidence.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] If the Prisoner calls a Witness that   #
has been called
before, and he to make his Evidence entire, appeals to (^Revell^) ,  #
we ought to call
him now, for it would have been improper before.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] If it be nothing but that he was sent    #
for Mr. (^Buckley^) ,
there is no great Harm in it. Otherwise we are in the Course of our
Evidence.
<P 53>
[$Then (^Revel^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Do you know the Occasion of Mr.        #
(^Buckley's^) coming
to (^Francia^) in (^Newgate^) ; Give an Account of what you know of  #
it.
   [$ (^Revell.^) $] My Lord, Mr. (^Francia^) , called to me one     #
Day, and I think it
was when I was in the Chappel, and told me, I believe I can do a Piece
of Service to the Government; I believe I can suppress the           #
publishing of the
(^Shift shifted^) , I am sure I can: Pray let me speak with Mr.      #
(^Buckley^) . Says I,
if you would have me, I will go to him, and desire him to come. When
would you speak with him? At any time, says he; then I believe the
Morning is the best to meet with him; and the next Morning I went    #
to him.
   [$Sir. (^J. Jekyll.^) $] Did you tell him the Occasion of         #
(^Francia's^) desiring to speak
with him.
   [$ (^Revell.^) $] Yes.
   [$Sir (^J. Jekyll.^) $] Was you in the Room with them?
   [$ (^Revell.^) $] No, but afterwards he said to me, I think I     #
have done the
Government some Service, you don't hear it come out as it us'd to do.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I desire to know whether Mr. (^Buckley^) was  #
not angry with you
that you did not stand at the Door.
   [$ (^Revell.^) $] He order'd me to be about the Door, but there   #
came some
Workmen to survey the Chappel, I was obliged to go with them, and he #
came
out and was angry that I was not there; and after that I stood there #
till they
had done, but I did not hear what Discourse past.
[$Then the Lord (^Townshend^) stood up.$]
   [$Lord (^Townshend.^) $] My Lord, Mr. (^Buckley^) came to me, and #
told me of the
Message he had receiv'd from the Prisoner about the (^Shift          #
Shifted^) , a 
scandalous Paper that was sent about the Kingdom. He ask'd me if he  #
should go:
I told him I thought it was right to go, but I told him he must be   #
cautious,
for I did not doubt but that the Prisoner was capable of that        #
Villany I now
find he is. He came back to me, and told me what he has now said;    #
and I
believe it to be all that past between them, for I have always found #
him
faithful and honest. I thought it was a Service to put a stop to     #
that Paper;
and I did give some ease to that Man that is named.
   I am amazed how there can be such Villany as in the Brother. He   #
came
to the Office two or three Times with Petitions. I never said any    #
thing
more, than that it was not in my Power to do any thing; that he must
deal ingenuously, tell all that he knew, and shew that he would      #
speak all 
the Truth; that that was the Way to recommend him to the King's Mercy;
that I could not do any thing without it. And I believe the manner I
treated Mr. (^Harvey^) will justifie me, with all that know any      #
thing of it,
from the Suspicion of such Intentions against him. All that I did    #
was in
regard to the Prisoners wretched Circumstances, and before Mr.       #
(^Stanhope^) ;
and I never desir'd any thing of him, but to tell the Truth, and the #
whole
Truth.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] You told me I should be hang'd, drawn, and    #
quartered; and
your Lordship told me many a time, Damn you, you Dog, now I have got
Mr. (^Harvey^) in my Clutches, and you will let him go from me. If   #
there
was no particular Animosity against me, why should I be              #
distinguish'd, for
none were put in Irons for Treasonable Practices, but me.
   [$Lord (^Townshend.^) $] I would not take up your Lordship's      #
time, but only to
say, that the Warrant for Irons, and to be kept without Pen, Ink, and
Paper, was after that Letter had been deliver'd to me, the Contents  #
of which
will sufficiently justifie the Precautions used in that Warrant. I   #
was sorry
to see the ill Use he made of the Liberty that I had before given    #
him, and I
did issue that Warrant in that manner. Treasonable Practices were    #
then no
more bailable than Treason; and it's no new thing to fetter          #
State-Prisoners
under such an Accusation.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] I beg leave to ask your Lordship one Question, #
whether you
apprehend that (^Curtis^) deserv'd any Credit?
<P 54>
   [$Lord (^Townshend.^) $] I can say no more, than that he made     #
some Discoveries,
and there was no Prosecution against him. I knew nothing of the Man
before, and I know nothing more of him now.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Did those Informations appear to be true?
   [$Lord (^Townshend.^) $] A great part did, by the Confession of   #
one of the Persons
he accused.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] As to the two Women that were examined   #
just now, there
was a Remark made, that their Testimony was extraordinary; I have    #
five or
six People to speak to their Reputation, if it sticks with Mr.       #
(^Attorney^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Perhaps such as themselves; but        #
however call them.
[$Then Mr. (^Everall^) was called.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What do you know of (^White^) or         #
(^Meggison^) ?
   [$ (^Everall.^) $] I know nothing of them.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Do you know where the Prisoner's Foreign       #
Letters used to
be left?
   [$ (^Everall.^) $] His Letter always came to my House.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Was he usually watchful for the coming in of   #
his Letters, as if
there was any Thing of Concern in them?
   [$ (^Everall.^) $] No, they often used to lye some time before he #
call'd for them.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] How long did they use to lye?
   [$ (^Everall.^) $] Sometimes three or four Days.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Were they kept up close till he called for them?
   [$ (^Everall.^) $] No, they lay in a publick Room, so that any    #
one might see them.
[$Then Mrs. (^Everall^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What do you know of any Letters directed #
for Mr.
(^Francia^) ; where were they left?
   [$Mrs. (^Everall.^) $] They used to be brought to our House, and  #
they have lain
two or three Days together on a publick Table before they have been  #
fetch'd
away.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] How long ago was that?
   [$Mrs. (^Everall.^) $] About seven Years ago.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] Have any been directed to your House of late?
   [$Mrs. (^Everall.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] We shall now examine some Witnesses to the     #
Copy-Book, to
prove that it is not of his Hand-Writing; and I don't doubt but that #
will have
its weight.
   [$ (^Lord Chief Baron.^) $] He own'd it to be his Copy-Book of    #
his Letters to his
Correspondents.
   [$Mr. (^Cowper.^) $] We lay the stress upon this, that he said it #
was his Copy-Book
of his Letters to his Correspondents Abroad.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] But you know Mr. (^Buckley^) laid a stress     #
upon its being his
Hand-Writing.
[$Then one (^Rafter^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Show him the Copy-Book, look upon it,    #
are you
acquainted with the Prisoner's Hand-Writing?
   [$ (^Rafter.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Is any part of that Book his             #
Hand-Writing?
   [$ (^Rafter.^) $] No, I take it to be his Son's, (^George         #
Francia's^) : The Prisoner writes
a smaller Hand. I take no part of it to be his Hand so far as I have #
gone.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I believe it may be of use for all the   #
Witnesses to look it
over; we have four or five to this Point; and if I am rightly        #
instructed, there
is not one Word in that Book wrote by the Prisoner.
   [$Mr. Justice (^Pratt.^) $] If it is not his Writing, whose do    #
you take it to be?
   [$ (^Rafter.^) $] I don't take it to be his.
   [$Mr. Justice (^Pratt.^) $] Whose do you take it to be? Are you   #
acquainted with
his Son's Hand?
<P 55>
   [$ (^Rafter.^) $] I don't know whether it is his Son's or not.
   [$Mr. Justice (^Pratt.^) $] Are there any other Persons that      #
write for him?
   [$ (^Rafter.^) $] He had sometimes.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Here is a Letter of his own writing;   #
pray let him look on
that, and see whether that is his Hand; do you believe that to be    #
his writing.
   [$ (^Rafter.^) $] No, I don't think it is.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] (^Curtis^) has prov'd that he own'd    #
that Letter.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] What Letter did I own?
[$Then (^Simon Francia^) was called again.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What do you say to that Book?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] There is not one Syllable of his Writing in #
this Book; I have
known his Hand-Writing about twenty Years.
[$Then (^Barwell^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Are you acquainted with the Prisoner's   #
Hand-Writing?
Is any of that Book of his writing?
   [$ (^Barwell.^) $] None of it is his writing.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Do you know what Condition of Health he  #
was in about
the latter end of the Year 1714, and 1715?
   [$ (^Barwell.^) $] He was sick.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] For a Year before he was taken, what     #
Condition was
he in? Was he able to write Letters?
   [$ (^Barwell.^) $] He was sick.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did he use to write Letters in that time?
   [$ (^Barwell.^) $] I don't know.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Whose Hand do you take it to be?
   [$ (^Barwell.^) $] How do I know that?
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Are you acquainted with his Son's Hand?
   [$ (^Barwell.^) $] No, not at all.
[$Then (^Simon Francia^) was called again.$]
   [$mr. (^Att. General.^) $] You have look'd upon the Book; whose   #
Hand-Writing do
you take it to be?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I don't know.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Do you know his Son's Hand-Writing?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I never had any Correspondence, or great    #
Acquaintance with
him.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Did you ever see him write?
   [$ (^S. Francia.^) $] I don't remember that I did.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] We will trouble you with but one piece of      #
Evidence more; we
will call Dr. (^Cade^) , who attended him in his Sickness. We have   #  
offer'd
Evidence, that no part of that Book is his writing; we will now      #
offer some
Proof that he was not capable of writing at that time.
[$Then Dr. (^Cade^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Pray Doctor, did you attend the Prisoner as    #
his Physician at
any time?
   [$Dr. (^Cade.^) $] My Lord, I was sent for to him on the second   #
Day of 
(^November^) , 1714. I attended him till the 18th of the same Month, #
and within that
time I visited him nine Times, I found him in a great deal of Pain,  #
and he
was lame in his Hand; sometime after my coming he grew better.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Was he confin'd to his Bed?
   [$Dr. (^Cade.^) $] Sometimes he kept his Bed, and sometimes he    #
sate up.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] You say he was in Pain, and lame in his Hand;  #
which Hand
was it?
   [$Dr. (^Cade.^) $] I don't remember which; nor do I know any      #
thing of him,
only at that time.
   [$Sir (^J. Jekyll.^) $] Every one of the Letters were wrote after #
that time.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] What Condition did you leave me in?
   [$Dr. (^Cade.^) $] In a very bad Condition.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you not hear of the Condition I was in    #
afterwards?
   [$Dr. (^Cade.^) $] I don't remember that I heard any Thing of you #
after that.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] We will call a few Witnesses to prove what     #
Circumstances
he was in, and that he was well affected to the Government.
<P 56>
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] By my Instructions he appears to be a    #
Foreigner, and so
disinterested in those unfortunate Divisions that are among us: And
accordingly there is nothing of Whig or Tory in his Letters.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] Don't you remember when he came to     #
(^Newgate^) he
wrote he liked his Company, for he found them all Tories.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] We shall show you that he was zealous    #
for the Good of
the Kingdom, and was against all that was disadvantageous to Trade   #
in the
late Treaty of Peace. That he never went into any publick Places,    #
except
to the (^Grecian^) Coffee-house, which is a Place sure not tainted   #
with Sedition.
[$Then Mr. (^Everall^) was called again.$]
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] How long have you known the Prisoner?
   [$ (^Everall.^) $] Several Years.
   [$Mr. (^Ward.^) $] Has he been peaceable, and easy in his         #
Conversation, with
Respect to the Government?
   [$ (^Everall.^) $] I remember at the proclaiming the Peace he     #
said, he thought
the Nation was ruin'd, for he thought it a scandalous Peace.
   [$Mr. (^Att. General.^) $] That is much; for you make him a       #
(^Frenchman^) , sure
he might have approved it.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] This is not what I have in my Brief, but #
perhaps he
may recommend himself to your Esteem by it: He doth not to mine.
    My Lord, I will take up your Time only with this Remark: The great
Foundation of this Evidence is the Confession made by the Man himself.
Without the Key made by him, this had been applicable to no Body. I
remember Sir (^Joseph Jekyll^) was pleas'd to say, he would not      #
excite the
Passions of the Jury, but rather appeal to their Judgments, so will  #
I. Great
Part of this Correspondence [^SOURCE TEXT: Correspendence^] relates  #
to Mr. (^Harvey^) , and one would have
thought they had something extraordinary to have charged on him, 
considering the Length of his Restraint; but I need not observe to   #
the Jury
that he is at large. He was under Restraint, nothing could be        #
imputed to
him, and he is discharged.
   [$ (^Lord C. Baron.^) $] (^Francia^) , Have you any Thing more to #
say?
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] As for my Nativity I have more Witnesses. I   #
have more
Witnesses as to my Character. I have more Witnesses to prove that I  #
was a
quiet Man, and never disaffected to the Government.
[$Then Mr. (^John Slater^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What do you know of the Prisoner's       #
Behaviour?
   [$Mr. (^Slater.^) $] I have known him about four or five Years.   #
There being a
Commission of Bankrupcy against him, I was recommended to assist him
in that Commission. I did give him the best Assistance I could, and I
several Times met him, sometimes at the (^Grecian^) Coffee-house,    #
and sometimes
at my own House. I took him for a (^Frenchman^) , he used very much  #
to espouse
the Interest of the King of (^France^) , which I used to chide him   #
for. As for
Parties here, I had some Discourse with him, and he used to think we #
were
a strange People to fall out among our selves.
[$Then (^Thomas Richardson^) was sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What do you know of the Prisoner and his #
Behaviour?
   [$ (^Richardson.^) $] I have known him five or six Years, and I   #
believe I have taken
five or six Pounds of his Money. When he was sick he took a Liking to
me, and would not be quiet unless I came often to see him, and I used
often to sit with him in the Evening and bear him Company, and it    #
was a great
Surprize to me when I heard he was taken up, for he used often to    #
drink a
Health to King (^George^) , and hoped he should get up to see him,   #
and hoped
this would be a quiet Nation again. He was then so weak that he could
not stir Hand or Foot. But he used to call me (^Vulcan^) , and bid   #
me drink
King (^George's^) Health.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] How long is it since he was so weak that #
he could not
stir Hand or Foot.
   [$ (^Richardson.^) $] About a Year and five or six Months. And    #
when he got
abroad, I then was forced to follow him for what he owed me, and I   #
have
gone after him several Times to the (^Grecian^) Coffee-house.
   [$ (^Lord C. Baron.^) $] Have you any Thing more to offer.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] No.
