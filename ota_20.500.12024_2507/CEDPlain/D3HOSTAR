[}THE 
STAR-CHAMBER 
EPITOMIZED.
OR,
A DIALOGVE BETWEENE 
(^INQUISITION^) A NEWES-SMELLER, AND (^CHRISTOPHER
COB-WEBBE^) A KEEPER OF THE RECORDS FOR THE
(^STARRE-CHAMBER^) .}]
   [$ (^In.^) $] My old friend (^Christopher Cob-Webbe^) how
goe all things at your Office, what is it
full Terme with the brave Sparkes of
your Court?
   [$ (^Cr.^) $] Truly Sir I am sore afraid the Terme is at his
full hight, J beleeve J have layd all the Records in
their severall places, and placed them in due order
to little purpose.
   [$ (^In.^) $] Why I pray thee tell what is the matter, J hope
the Parliament doth not meddle with so great a
Court as your high Court of (^Starre-chamber^) .
   [$ (^Cr.^) $] For my part I know not what the Parliament
either doth or intendeth to doe, but this I am sure of,
all my Masters that had vsed to sell some of their
papers so deare as they doe at the Lottery, walke from
one end of the Office to the other sighing, and
pitifully complaine and say their time of 
Angell-gathering, they are sore afraid, is at an end.
<P 2>
   [$ (^In.^) $] Is it possible any thing can discourage the sparks
of your Office had they bin corrupt, as I beleeve it
is unpossible?
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] No truly, I thinke they were never corrupt; for
they were honest men enough in all Conscience to
be Lawyers.
   [$ (^In.^) $] Why are not Lawyers so honest as other men?
Doe you know any thing to the contrary?
   [$ (^Ch.^) $] No Sir, I dare not say to the contrary; for I have
all my livelyhood from amongst all these large
Bundels of law, which I have here placed in their order,
and cleansed them from the Cobwebs, wherewith
they were plentifully hung.
   [$ (^Jn.^) $] They are very large indeed, they cost
something in writing.
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] J believe you, for they have bin coppied,
ingrossed, written, rescribed, prescribed, and transcribed
forty times over.
   [$ (^Jn.^) $] But what did the (^Cliants^) use to pay for so
many times writing?
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] Yes that they did, and in ready money too, the
sparkes of our Court would not be procrastinated,
prorogued, or demurred.
   [$ (^Inquis.^) $] But J hope their Rates were conscionable:
were they not?
   [$ (^Cob.^) $] Yes! they did pay but xij.d. a sheete for the
Coppy. [$ (^In.^) $] That was somthing deare, but how
did they write them?
   [$ (^Cob.^) $] Very conscionably, some 15 lines in a sheet,
with some 4 or 5 words in a line, which stradled so
wide as an ordinary (^French-man^) .
   [$ (^In.^) $] In my opinion xij.d. a sheet was somthing deare.
   [$ (^Cob.^) $] Alas! that was not all, they must pay to the
<P 3>
Gent. in the Cut-finger'd Gloves for the expedition
and for the writing, besides the xij.d. a sheet for the
Coppy. [$ (^In.^) $] Thou now tells me of a thing more
then ever J heard of; is it possible, a thing may bee
copyed and ingrossed, and not written, that the Cliant
must pay xij.d. a sheet for the coppy, besides money
for writing, and expedition? Surely both the Masters
& the clarks of your Offices, have brave times of it.
   [$ (^Cob.^) $] Yes, they had brave times of it, but now (if we
may credit their owne report) these dayes are done,
and they must suffer now for all their exactions, and
extortions, for the squeesing and screwing their
Cliants. [$ (^In.^) $] How J pray did they squeese their Cliants?
   [$ (^C.^) $] Why it had bin almost so good for a man to have
bin two Termes in the high Commission (which is
now in faire possibility to be purged from it's
exactions, by those sure Curers the (^Parliament Doctors^)
then one Terme in the (^Star-chamber^) .
   [$ (^Inquis.^) $] That is unpossible sure.
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] Oh these Gent. have had brave times of it; for
had a cliant come some 50. or 60. miles for a (^ (\subpoena\) ^) ,
they would have made him to have attended at least
3. dayes, when they could have dispatched it in halfe
an houre, and (^Puny^) in the mackereld tailed Gowne,
would have made him to have paid 5 s. for his
extraordinary care and labour, though it belonged to his
Office to take forth the writ (^ (\gratis\) ^) , and besides hee
should have paid at least xij.d. more then his due for
the Fee of the Writ.
   [$ (^In.^) $] This was intollerable exaction, but I pray thee
proceed.
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] Had a good Fellow but killed a Coney
within halfe a mile of a Gent. Parke, (^Spy-fault^) hee that
<P 4>
sowes the seed of dissention for our Court (though
the Gent. that owned [^SOURCE TEXT: owed^] the Parke never knew of it)
would straight have him up, and would draw a Bill 
in Parliament the compasse of a mourning Cloke,
wherein he would set forth, that contrary to the
peace of our Soveraigne Lord the King, the people
being unlawfully armed with Guns, Swords, Bowes
and Arrowes, and furnished with Dogs, nets, and
other Engins, there hunted, killed, and destroyed all his
deare and game of Conies, with more superfluous
words then are contained in a (^Calliepeia^) , & the poore
ignorant Clyant being fetched up, and seeing all these
strange matters laid to his charge; would with all his
heart give halfe he was worth to be rid of this unjust
businesse; and then must be forced to compound
with (^Spy-fault^) and these other spungy Gent. who
would looke so contemptibly upon the poore
fellow, as a Brasen faced Jaylor will upon a Malefactor.
   [$ (^In.^) $] But what in case the poore fellow had not
ready mony, would they not give him some time to
furnish himselfe?
   [$ (^Cr.^) $] No, they had no more conscience nor beleefe
then the compounded fat bawd in the middle of
(^Beech-lane^) ; For had he not ready mony they would
rap out twenty Basiliske oathes, and cry (^ (\Currat Lex\) ^) .
   [$ (^In.^) $] But J pray thee to what use was the money
taken, and how was it imployed?
   [$ (^Cr.^) $] To build neither (^Hospitalls^) , nor               #
(^Almes-houses^) ,
neither the King, Common-wealth, nor party
wronged was the better for it; it was for the onely
benefit of our large conscienced Clarkes.
   [$ (^In.^) $] I pray thee proceed?
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] Had a poore Clyant that was to put in his 
<P 5>
answer to one of these or such like unconscionable
matters, or to appeare upon some occasion in the Court,
but neglected halfe an houre more then the time
limited: the two Clarkes would have agreed together
to informe the Court of the Contempt, and straight
have him censured; which with their subtile devises
for Fees and such like would have beene twice the
value of the offence, and the poore Clyant should
surely pay every farthing, or else lye in prison, and
out of hand too a writ then would be sued forth for
the levying of that in halfe an houre which is
something under three dayes.
   [$ (^Jn.^) $] But I pray thee explaine who were these two
Clarkes.
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] Why the one was to be for the plaintiffe, and
the other for the Defendant.
   [$ (^In.^) $] Js it possible the two adverse Clarkes should
agree to cosen the poore Clyant? then J perceive it is
full time these things should be looked unto.
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] It is true as I tell you, for though they would
in the presence of the ignorant Clyants raile at one
another, and accuse one another, of undue
proceeding, yet at night at a Taverne or else-where in some
private place they would divide the spoyle & laugh
at the silly ignorance of the poore Clyant; they have
a thousand of these wayes: I have known them make
the Clyant pay for expedition in the middle of a
long vacation when they have had nothing at all to
doe, yet many times made the defendant to put in his
answer and take a Coppy of the Bill when the
plaintife hath signified he is satisfied, and that they are
agreed?
   [$ (^Jn.^) $] Surely then the Clarkes of your Offices are
very rich.
<P 6>
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] Yes truly some of them are; but there is
othersome who have laid out more money then was
their owne for the purchasing of places in our
Offices.
   [$ (^Inquis.^) $] And how doe they take it?
   [$ (^Chr.^) $] Faith for them who lived long in our Office
as Ministers preach conscience to their under clarks,
and say they must write more close with their words,
whereas before they could never write wide enough,
and the rest that have laid out more then their owne
whole estates upon their Office, hang downe their
dejected heads, all say they are utterly broke, and
know not what course to take, (^and I my selfe must sing
the same song, for I faile in my trade too^) : yet J hope
my generous Masters will let mee have this benefit
for all my good service to make my best profit of
all these large Roles of parchment, which I will sell
to (^Hugh Higginbottome^) at the signe of the 24. 
halfe-penny loaves in (^Threed-needle-street^) , who will sell
them by retaile to furnish all the large measuring
Taylors in Towne; for they are fit for nothing else,
and I hope this will be sufficient to maintaine mee in
an honest way. And so farewell all (^Star-chamber^)
Exaction.
