[^UNEXPECTEDLY, MASTER F. J. COMES ACROSS THE LADY ELINOR.^]
[$Wherfore (as in a traunce) he lifted vp his dazled eyes, 
& so continued in a certen kind of admiration, not vnlike 
the Astronomer, who (hauing after a whole nights 
trauayle, in the grey morning found his desired starre) hath 
fixed his hungry eies to behold the (^Comete^) long looked for: 
wherat this gracious Dame (as one that could discerne y=e= 
sun before hir cha~ber windowes were wide ope~) did deign 
to embolden the feinting Knight w=t= these or like words.$]
   I perceiue now [$ (quod she) $] how mishap doth follow me, 
that hauing chosen this walke for a simple solace, I am 
here disquieted by the man that meaneth my distructio~: [$&
therwithal, as half angry, began to turne hir back, when 
as my friend (^F. J.^) now awaked, gan thus salute hir.$]
   Mystres [$ (quod he) $] and I perceiue now, y=t= good hap hau~ts
me, for being by lack of oportunitie constreined to co~mit 
my welfare vnto these blabbing leaues of bewraying 
paper [$ (shewing y=t= in his hand) $] I am here reco~forted w=t=
happy view of my desired ioye: [$& therewithall reuere~tly kissing 
his hand, did softly distreine hir slender arme & so stayed 
hir departure.$] [^...^]
[^THE LADY ELINOR HAS BEEN AVOIDING COMPANY FOR SOME TIME WHEN SHE
HAS A HEAVY NOSE-BLEED.^]
<P 213>
[^...^] [$For 
which accident the said (^F. J.^) amongst other prety co~ceits, 
hath a present remedy, wherby he tooke occasion (when 
they of the house had all in vayne sought many ways to 
stop hir bleeding) to worke his feate in this wyse: First 
he pleaded ignorance, as though he knewe not hir name, 
and therefore demaunded the same of one other
Gentlewoma~ in the house, whose name was Mistres Frances, 
who when shee had to him declared that hir name was 
(^Elinor^) , hee said these wordes or very lyke in effect:$] If I 
thought I should not offend Mystres (^Elynor^) , I would not 
doubt to stop hir bleeding, without eyther payne or 
difficulty. [$This gentlewoman somewhat tyckled wyth hys 
words, did incontinent make relacion thereof to the sayd 
Mystres (^Elynor^) , who immediately (declaring that (^F. J.^) 
was hir late receyued seruaunt) returned the sayd 
messanger vnto him with especiall charge, that hee shoulde 
employ his deuoyre towards the recouery of hir health, 
with whom the same (^F. J.^) repayred to the chamber of his 
desired: and finding hir sette in a chayre, leaning on the 
one side ouer a siluer bason: After his due reuerence                #
[^SOURCE TEXT: reuereuce^] , hee 
layd his hand on hir temples, and priuily rounding hir 
in hir eare, desired hir to commaund a Hazell sticke and 
a knyfe: the which being brought, hee deliuered vnto hir, 
saying on this wyse.$] Mystres I wil speak certen words 
in secret to my selfe, and doe require no more: but when 
you heare me saie openly this word (^Amen^) , that you with 
this knyfe will make a nycke vppon this hasell stycke: 
and when you haue made fyue nickes, commaunde mee 
also to cease. [^...^]
[^THE LADY DOES AS F. J. SAYS AND AFTER THE THIRD AMEN THE NOSE
BLEED HAS STOPPED.^]
<P 214>
[^...^] [$ (^F. J.^) then chaunging his prayers into priuate talk,
said softly vnto hir.$] Mystres, I am glad that I am hereby
enabled to do you some seruice, and as the staunching of
your own bloud may some way reco~fort you, so if y=e=
shedding of my bloud may any way content you, I beseech
you commaund it, for it shalbe euermore readily
employed in your seruice, [$and therwithal with a loud voyce
pronounced$] (^Amen^) : [$wherwith the good Lady making a nyck
did secretly answere thus:$] Good seruaunt [$ (^quod shee^) $] I
must needs think my self right happy to haue gained your
seruice and good will, and be you sure, that although ther
be in me no such desert as may draw you into this depth
of affection, yet such as I am, I shalbe alwayes glad to
shewe my self thankfull vnto you, and now, if you think
your self assured, that I shall bleede no more, doe the~
pronounce your fifth (^Amen^) , [^---^]
[^F. J. BECOMES POPULAR AMONG THE LADIES AND HAS A GOOD TIME.^]
<P 216>
[^...^] [$And one daye passing the time
amongst them, their playe grew to this end, that his
Mistresse, being Queene, demaunded of him these three
questions.$] Seruaunt [$ (quod she) $] I charge you, aswell
vppon your allegiance being nowe my subiect, as also
vppon your fidelitie, hauing vowed your seruice vnto mee
that you aunswere me these three questions, by the very
truth of your secret thought. First, what thing in this
vniuersall world doth most reioyce and comforte you? [$ (^F. I.^)
abasing his eyes towardes the ground, toke good 
aduisement in his aunswere, when a fayre gentlewoman of
the company clapped him on the shoulder, saying,$] how
<P 217>
now sir, is your ha~d on your halfpeny? [$To whom he
aunswered,$] no fayre Lady, my hand is on my harte, and yet
my hart is not in myne owne handes: [$wherewithall
abashed turning towardes dame (^Elinor^) he sayed.$] My
souereigne & Mistresse, according to the charge of your
commaund, and the dutie that I owe you, my tongue shal
bewraye vnto you the truth of myne intent. At this present
a rewarde giuen me without desert doth so reioyce mee
with continuall remembraunce therof, that though my
mind be so occupied to thinke thereon, as that daye nor
night I can be quiet from that thought, yet the ioye and
pleasure which I conceiue in the same is such, that I can
neither be cloyed with continuaunce therof, nor yet
afrayde, that any mishap can counteruayle so great a 
treasure. This is to me such a heauen to dwell in, as that I
feede by day, and repose by night, vpon the fresh record
of this reward, [^---^]
[^ELINOR ASKS THE SECOND QUESTION AND COMMENTS ON F. J.'S ANSWERS.^]
[^...^] Seruant, I had thought to haue touched you
yet nearer with my third question, but I will refrayne
to attempt your pacience: and now for my third demau~d,
aunswere me directly in what manner this passion doth
handle you? and howe these contraries maye hang
<P 218>
together by any possibilitie of concorde? for your wordes are
strauunge. [$ (^F. I.^) now rowsing him selfe boldly toke
occasion thus to handle his aunswere.$] Mistresse [$ (quod he) $]
my wordes in dede are straunge, but yet my passion is
is much straunger, and theruppon this other day to
content mine owne fa~tasie I deuised a (^Sonet^) , which although
it be a peece of Cocklorells musicke, and such as I might
be ashamed to publish in this company, yet because my
truth in this aunswere may the better appeare vnto you,
I pray you vouchsafe to receiue the same in writing: [^---^]
[^F. J. PRODUCES HIS SONNET. F. J. AND ELINOR ARE LEFT ALONE: HE
SUGGESTS THAT THEY TAKE A WALK IN A GALLERY.^]
<P 219>
[^...^] Thinke
you so seruaunt [$ (quod she?) $] and the last tyme that I
walked there I suppose I toke the cause of my mallady, but
by your aduise (and for you haue so clerkly steynched my
bleeding) I will assaye to walke there to morow. Mistres
[$quod he,$] and in more ful accomplishment of my duetie
towards you, and in sure hope that you wil vse y=e= same 
onelie to your owne priuate co~moditie, wil there awaite
vppon you, & betwene you & me wil teach you the ful order
how to steynch the bleeding of any creature, wherby you
shall be as cuning as my selfe. Gramercy good seruaunt,
[$qd she,$] I thinke you lost the same in writing here
yesterday, but I cannot vnderstand it, and therfore to morrowe
(if I feele my selfe any thing amended) I wil send for you
thither to enstruct me throughly: [$thus they departed. And
at supper time, the Knight of the Castel finding fault that
his gestes stomacke serued him no better, began to accuse
the grosenes of his vyands, to whom one of the
gentlewomen which had passed the afternoone in his company,
aunswered,$] Nay sir, [$qd she,$] this gentleman hath a passio~,
the which once once in a daye at the least doth kill his
appetite. Are you so well acquainted with the disposition of
his body [$qd the Lord of the house?$] by his owne saying, [$qd
she,$] & not otherwise. Fayre Ladie [$qd (^F. I.^) $] you either
mistoke me or ouerheard me then, for I told of a
comfortable humor which so fed me with continual reme~brance of
ioye, as y=t= my stomack being ful therof doth desire in
maner none other vittayles. Why sir, [$qd y=e= host,$] do you then
liue by loue? God forbid Sir [$quod (^F. I.^) $] for then my
cheekes wold be much thinner then they be, but there are
diuers other greater causes of ioy, then y=e= doubtful lottes
<P 220>
of loue, and for myne owne part, to be playne, I cannot
loue, and I dare not hate. I would I thought so, [$quod the
gentlewoman. And thus with prety nyppes, they passed
ouer their supper: which ended, the Lord of the house
required (^F. I.^) to daunce and passe the tyme with the
gentlewoman, which he refused not to doe. But sodenly, before
the musicke was well tuned, came out Dame (^Elynor^) in
hir night attyre, and said to the Lord, that (supposing the
solitarinesse of hir cha~ber had encreased hir maladie) she
came out for hir better recreacio~ to see them dau~ce.$] Wel
done daughter [$ (quod the Lord.) $] And I Mistres [$ (quod (^F.
J.^) $] would gladly bestowe the leading of you about this
great chamber, to dryue away the fayntnesse of your
feuer. No good seruaunt, [$quod the Lady,$] but in my steede, I
pray you daunce with this fayre Gentlewoman, [$pointing
him to the Lady that had so taken him up at supper. (^F. J.^)
to auoyde mistrust, did agree to hir request without
furder entreaty. The daunce begon, this Knight marched
on with the Image of S. (^Fraunces^) in his hand, and S.
(^Elynor^) in his hart. The violands at ende of the pauion
staied a whyle: in which time this Dame sayde to (^F. J.^) on
this wyse.$] I am right sorry for you in two respects,
although the familiarity haue hytherto had no great
continuance betwene vs: and as I do lament your case, so doo
I reioyce (for myne own contentation) that I shall now
see a due triall of the experiment which I haue long
desired. [$This sayd, she kept silence. When (^F. J.^) (somewhat
astonied with hir straunge speeche) thus aunswered:$]
Mystres although I cannot conceyue the meaning of your
wordes, yet by curtesy I am constrayned to yeelde you
thankes for your good will, the which appeareth no lesse
in lamenting of mishaps, than in reioycing at good
fortune. What experiment you meane to trye by mee, I
know not, but I dare assure you, that my skill in
experiments is very simple. [$Herewith the Instruments
<P 221>
sounded a new Measure, and they passed forthwardes, leauing
to talke, vntill the noyse ceassed: which done, the
gentlewoman replied.$] I am sory sir, that you did erewhile,
denie loue and all his lawes, and that in so open audience.
Not so [$quod (^F. I.^) $] but as the word was roundly taken, so
can I readely aunswere it by good reason. Wel [$quod she,$]
how if the hearers will admit no reasonable aunswere?
My reason shall yet be neuerthelesse [$ (quod he) $] in
reasonable iudgement. [$Herewith she smyled, and he cast a glance
towardes dame (^Elinor^) askances art thou pleased? Againe
the vyols called them forthwardes, and againe at the end
of the braule sayd (^F. J.^) to this gentlewoman:$] I pray you
Mistres, and what may be the second cause of your sorow
sustained in my behalfe? Nay soft [$quod she,$] percase I haue
not yet told you the first, but content your selfe, for the
second cause you shall neuer know at my handes, vntill I
see due trial of the experiment which I haue long desired.
Why then [$ (quod he) [^SOURCE TEXT she CORRECTED TO he IN           #
ERRATA LIST^] $] I can but wish a present occasion to
bring y=e= same to effect, to y=e= end that I might also
vndersta~d y=e= mistery of your meaning. And so might you fail of
your purpose [$ (quod she) $] for I meane to be better assured
of him that shall know the depth of mine intent in such a
secrete, than I do suppose that any creature (one except)
may be of you. Gentlewoma~ [$ (quod he) $] you speak (^Greeke^) ,
the which I haue now forgotten, and myne instructers
are to farre from mee at this present to expound your
words. Or els to neare [$ (quod she) and so smiling stayed
hir talke, when the musick called them to another dau~ce.
Which ended, (^F. I.^) halfe afrayd of false suspect, and more
amazed at this straunge talke, gaue ouer, and bringing
Mistresse (^Fraunces^) to hir place was thus saluted by his
Mistresse.$] Seruaunt [$ (quod she) $] I hadde done you great
wrong to haue daunced with you, considering that this
gentlewoman and you had former occasion of so waighty
conference. Mistresse [$sayd (^F. J.^) $] you had done mee great
<P 222>
pleasure, for by our conference I haue but brought my
braynes in a busie coniecture. I doubt not [$ (sayd his
Mistresse) $] but you wil end that busines easely. It is hard [$said
(^F. I.^) $] to end the thing, wherof yet I haue founde no
beginning. [$His Mistresse with change of countenaunce
kept silence, whereat dame (^Fraunces^) reioycing, cast out
this bone to gnawe on.$] I perceyue [$ (quod she) $] it is euill to
halt before a Creple. [$ (^F. I.^) perceyuing now that his
Mistresse waxed angry, thought good on hir behalfe thus to
aunswere:$] and it is euill to hop before them that runne
for the Bell: [$his Mistresse replied,$] and it is euill to hang
the Bell at their heeles which are alwayes running. [$The
L. of the Castle ouerhearing these proper quippes, rose
out of his chayre, and comming towards (^F. I.^) required
him to daunce a Gallyard.$] Sir [$sayd (^F. I.^) $] I haue hitherto
at your apoyntment but walked about the house, now if
you be desirous to see one tomble a turne or twayne, it is
like ynough that I might prouoke you to laugh at mee,
but in good faith my dauncing dayes are almost done, and
therfore sir [$ (quod he) $] I pray you speake to them that are
more nymble at tripping on the toe.
[^AN ANGRY ELINOR LEAVES THE DANCE: EARLY NEXT MORNING F. J. MEETS
FRANCES AND ANOTHER GENTLEWOMAN IN THE GARDEN.^]
<P 227>
[^...^] I little thought Syr Knight [$ (quod 
she) $] by your euensong yesternight, to haue found you 
presently at such a morrow masse, but I perceiue you serue
your Saint with double deuotion: and I pray God grau~t
you treble meede for your true intent. [$ (^F. J.^) taken thus
vpon the sodeine, could none otherwise answer but thus:$]
I told you Mistresse [$ (quod he) $] that I could laughe
without lust, and iest without ioye: [$and there withall starting
vp, with a more bolde countenance came towardes the
Dames, profering vnto them his seruice, to wayte vpon
the~ homewards.$] I haue heard say oft times [$ (qd Mistres
(^Fraunces^) ) $] that it is hard to serue two Maisters at one
time, but we wilbe right glad of your company. I thank
you [$ (quod (^F. J.^) ) and so walking on with them, fell
into sundry discourses, still refusing to touch any part of
their former communicacion, vntill Mistresse (^Fraunces^)
sayd vnto him:$] by my troth [$ (quod shee) $] I would bee your
debtour these two dayes, to aunswer me truely but
vnto one question that I will propound: fayre
Gentlewoman [$ (quod hee) $] you shall not neede to becomme my
debtour, but if it please you to quit question by questio~, I wil
be more ready to gratifie you in this request, than either
reason requireth, or than you would be willing to worke
my co~tentatio~. Master (^F. J.^) [$ (qd she, & y=t= sadly) $]       #
peradue~tur
you know but a litle how willing I would be to procure
<P 228>
your contentation, but you know that hitherto
familiaritie hath taken no deepe roote betwixt vs twayne. And
though I find in you no maner of cause whereby I might
doubt to commit this or greater matter vnto you, yit
haue I stayed hitherto so to doe, in doubt least you might
thereby iustly condempne mee both of arrogancy and
lack of discretion, wherwith I must yit foolishly affirm,
that I haue with great payne brydeled my tonge from
disclosing the same vnto you. Such is then the good will
that I beare towards you, the which if you rather iudge
to bee impudencie, than a friendly meaning, I may then
curse the hower that I first concluded thus to deale with
you: [$herewithall being now red for chaste bashefulnesse,
shee abased hir eyes, and stayed hir talke, to whom (^F. J.^)
thus aunswered.$] Mistresse (^Fraunces^) , if I should with so
exceeding villanie requite such and so exceeding courtesie,
I might not onely seeme to digenerate from all gentry,
but also to differ in behauiour from all the rest of my lyfe
spent: wherefore to be playne with you in few wordes,
I thinke my self so much bound vnto you for diuers
respects, as if abilitie doe not fayle mee, you shall fynde mee
myndfull in requitall of the same: and for disclosing your
mind to mee, you may if so please you aduenture it
without aduenture, for by this Sunne, [$quod hee,$] I will not
deceyue such trust as you shall lay vppon mee, and
furthermore, so farre foorth as I may, I wilbe yours in any
respect: wherfore I beseech you accept me for your
faithfull friend, and so shall you surely find mee. Not so, [$quod

and I wilbe to you as you shall please to terme mee: my

in a pleasaunt meadow alone, where I met with a tall
Gentleman, apparelled in a night gowne of silke all
embroadered about with a gard of naked swords, and when
he came towardes me I seemed to be afraide of him, but
he recomforted me saying, be not afrayd fayre Lady, for
I vse this garment onely for myne own defence: and in
this sort went that warlicke God (^Mars^) what time hee
taught dame (^Venus^) to make (^Vulcan^) a hamer of the newe
fashion. Notwithstanding these comfortable wordes the
fright of the dreame awaked me, and sithens vnto this
hower I haue not slept at al. And what tyme of the night

wherein I take more comforte than in your conformitie, 
and although your present rage is such that you can bee 
content to condemne a nomber vnknowen, for the 
transgression of one too well knowne: yet I do rather reioyce 
that you should iudge your pleasure ouer many, than to 
be abused by any. My good (^Hope^) [$ (quod he) $] it were not 
reason that after such manifold proofes of your exceding 
curtesies, I should vse straunge or contentious speech with so 
deare a friend, and in deede I must confesse that the 
opinion which I haue conceiued of my Mistresse, hath stirred 
my penne to write very hardly against all the feminine 
gender, but I pray you pardon me [$ (quod he) $] & if it please 
you I wil recant utas also (percase) I was but cloyed with 
(^Surquedry^) , and presumed to think more than may be 
proued. Yea but how if it were proued [$quod Dame 
(^Fraunces^) ?$] If it were so (which God forbid [$quod he) $] then  #
coulde 
you not blame me to conceiue that opinion. Howsoeuer I 
might blame you [$ (quod she) $] I meane not to blame you, 
but I demaund further, if it be as I thinke & you suspect, 
what will you then do? Surely [$ (quod (^F. I.^) ) $] I haue 
determed to drinke vp mine owne sorowe secretely, and to bid 
them both a (^Dieu^) . I like your farewell better than your 
fantasie [$ (quod she) $] and whensoeuer you can be content to 
take so much paynes, as the Knight (which had a night 
<P 291>
gowne garded with naked swordes) dyd take, I thinke 
you may put your selfe out of doubt of all these thinges.

[^---^] [$she gaue him this bone to gnawe vppon.$] And if I 
did so [$ (quod she) $] what than? [$Whereunto (^F. I.^) made none 
answere, but departed with this farewel.$] (^My losse is mine 
owne, and your gayne is none of yours, and soner can I recouer 
my losse than you enioye the gaine which you gape after.^)
