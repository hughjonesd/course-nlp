   [$Question.$] Do you know the Prisoner at the 
Bar?
   [$ (^Answer.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Did you know the deceased Mr. (^Francis 
Elcock^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Were you, at any time, employed to arrest
the Prisoner for Debt; and what happened in 
Consequence of it? Speak up, that the Gentlemen of
the Jury may hear you.
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, I was employed to arrest the Prisoner,
for a Debt due to (^John Atkin^) .
   [$Q.$] By whom were you so employed?
   [$ (^A.^) $] By Mr. (^Elcock^) , an Attorney.
   [$Q.$] You mean, I suppose, the deceased Mr. 
(^Elcock^) , -- him that was shot?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Go on.
   [$ (^A.^) $] Being so employed, to arrest Mr. (^Stevenson^) ,
I went to his House, and knocked at the Door.
Some Body came to the Window, and asked me,
what I wanted? I told the Person who came to the
Window, that I had a Letter for the Master of
the House, which she took through the Window;
and I suppose it was delivered to Mr. (^Stevenson^) .
   [$Q.$] Why do you suppose so?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Because, in a little Time after, Mr. 
(^Stevenson^) opened the Door.
   [$Q.$] The Prisoner opened the Door, you say?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, and he asked me, whether I lived with
the Gentleman who sent the Letter, or from whom
the Letter came? I told him I did; and Mr. 
(^Stevenson^) invited me in.
   [$Q.$] Well. what happened afterwards?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I went into the House, with Mr. (^Stevenson^) ,
and we then went together, towards the back Door,
<P 11>
and at the back Door, Mr. (^Stevenson^) stood still,
to call his Servant.
   [$Q.$] Whereabouts at the back Door did the
Prisoner stand still, to call his Servant? Was it
within-side of the Door, or at the out-side of the
Door?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He stood still upon a Step, at the back 
Door, the out-side of the Door; and I was 
within-side of the Door. -- I then took the Warrant I had
against Mr. (^Stevenson^) , out of my Pocket, and I
laid my Hand upon his Shoulder, and sayd, Sir, I
hope you will excuse me. --
   [$Q.$] Was the Prisoner then out of the Door?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes. I sayd, Sir, I hope you will excuse
me; For the Letter I gave you, was to decoy you.
I am a Bailiff; This is a Warrant against you; and
you are my Prisoner in the King's Name.
   [$Q.$] What did the Prisoner say then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He screek'd out, and sayd, I had used him 
ill.
   [$Q.$] What did you do afterwards?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Mr. (^Stevenson^) and I returned into the House,
and when we got into the Kitchen, he called to
(^Betty^) , who, I believe was his House-keeper, and
sayd to her, We have done ill, in letting this 
Man into the House; For, he has arrested me.
   [$Q.$] He told her, you had arrested him, you
say?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Well. What happened then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Prisoner went then towards the Fire,
and turned to the Screen on the right Hand, and
stood at the further End of the Screen.
   [$Q.$] What did he do then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He turned, all of a sudden, upon me, with
a Pistol in his Hand, and sayd, he would blow
<P 12>
my Brains out, if I did not get immediately out of
the House?
   [$Q.$] Did he present the Pistol at you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He did.
   [$Q.$] What did you say then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I told him, that was not the Way to do 
Business. -- Mr. (^Stevenson^) then snapp'd the Pistol at
me, but it miss'd Fire.
   [$Q.$] Are you sure he snapp'd the Pistol at you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, very sure.
   [$Q.$] Well, what did you do then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I went backwards thro' the Kitchen, and
Mr. (^Stevenson^) followed me; and in a narrow Passage
leading from the Kitchen towards the Door, he 
snapp'd the Pistol at me again; and he snapp'd the
Pistol at me a third Time, but I was then out of
the House.
   [$Q.$] When you got out of the House, where did
you go then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I went to the next House. I think Mr. 
(^Nevills's^) , where Mr. (^Elcock^) promised to be. Mr. 
(^Elcock^) saw me, and met me, and asked me, if I had
arrested (^Stevenson^) : I told Mr. (^Elcock^) , that I had 
arrested him, and that he had snapp'd a Pistol at me three
different Times, which obliged me to come away.
   [$Q.$] What did Mr. (^Elcock^) say to that?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Mr. (^Elcock^) sayd, I had done enough.
   [$Q.$] How did you proceed afterwards?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I told Mr. (^Elcock^) , if I had a Pistol, I could
bring him away; and he say'd, I should not want
that. -- Then Mr.(^Elcock^) sent a Man to the Plaintiff,
(^John Atkin's^) , and to bring Arms from his Father's.
   [$Q.$] Where did (^Atkin^) live?
   [$ (^A.^) $] At (^Cholmondley^) , not very far from (^Bickerton^) .
   [$Q.$] Did the Messenger return with Arms?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] What did you then?
<P 13>
   [$ (^A.^) $] After the Arms and Assistance were brought,
We went again to Mr. (^Stevenson's^) House.
   [$Q.$] Who went to the Prisoner's House?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I went, and the Plaintiff (^John Atkin^) , and a 
Servant of his, I think. Four or five Persons I
believe, came with me.
   [$Q.$] Was there another Sheriff's Officer with you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, a Man tolerated by the Sheriff, one
(^John Jones^) .
   [$Q.$] Did Mr. (^Elcock^) go to the Prisoner's House
with you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] What happened, when you all returned to 
the Prisoner's House?
   [$ (^A.^) $] As we were all running towards the Prisoner's
House, I saw the Prisoner, and another Man out of 
Doors; I called to Mr. (^Stevenson^) , and sayd, you
may as well stay, for we are coming for you.
   [$Q.$] Did the Prisoner hear you say this?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I believe he did.
   [$Q.$] Did the prisoner stay for you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, He, and the other Man with him, ran 
into the House.
   [$Q.$] Well, when you came up to the House;
pray, what followed?
   [$ (^A.^) $] When we came up to the House, I sayd to
Mr. (^Elcock^) , I know the Way to that Door; Go
you to the other.
   [$Q.$] How many Doors were there to the House?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Three.
   [$Q.$] Did you know all the three Doors?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, I knew them all.
   [$Q.$] You bid Mr. (^Elcock^) go to one of the Doors,
I think, you say?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I bid Mr. (^Elcock^) , and the others, to take
Care of two of the Doors, and I would go to the
other.
<P 14>
   [$Q.$] How far was the Door, that you sayd you
would go to, from the Door, you desired Mr. 
(^Elcock^) to take Care of?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It was a good Way distant, in going round
about.
   [$Q.$] You sayd, you would go to the third Door,
Did you know the Way to it?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, very well.
   [$Q.$] Did Mr. (^Elcock^) say any thing to the People
in the House, when he came up to the Door?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot tell, whether he did or not, because
I was not present, for I ran to the other Side of
the House.
   [$Q.$] Pray was the Door you went to, locked, or
made fast?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It was fast.
   [$Q.$] When you all came up to the Doors, as you
have been mentioning, -- pray, what followed?
   [$ (^A.^) $] In a very little Time, almost immediately
after I came up to the Door, I heard a Noise. --
I heard a Gun go off.
   [$Q.$] Which Way did the Noise come? Where
did you apprehend, the Gun went off. In what 
Situation were you from the Noise, or Report of it?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Noise came, as betwixt me and them;
betwixt me and the People who came with me.
   [$Q.$] How far distant might you be from the 
Door, where the Gun was fired?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Nine or ten Yards it might be from Mr. 
(^Elcock^) .
   [$Q.$] When you heard the Noise, and the Gun go
off, what did you do then? it must have alarm'd
you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] When I heard them crying out on the other
Side, I went backwards to an Hedge, and looking
<P 15>
over it, I saw Mr. (^Elcock^) held by two Men, sitting
on a Block.
   [$Q.$] You saw Mr. (^Elcock^) sitting on a Block 
supported by two Men, How did he look?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Very piteously indeed.
   [$Q.$] Did you hear him say any thing?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, I heard him say, Oh! I am shot. I
am shot.
   [$Q.$] Was Mr. (^Elcock^) at a great Distance from the
Gun, at the Time he received the Wound, or was
he near it.
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot tell, whether he was at a great, or
a small Distance from it.
   [$Q.$] What did you do, after you had seen Mr. 
(^Elcock^) sitting on the Block?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I returned again to my own Door, to 
prevent the Prisoner's getting out.
   [$Q.$] Did you see Mr. (^Elcock^) afterwards?
   [$ (^A.^) $] In about ten Minutes afterwards, I saw two
Men, carrying him down the Lane.

was carried to?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$Q.$] Did you see him afterwards?

the Shot-hole, or lower, or how?

which the Ball had made.
   [$Q.$] Could you see thro' the two Holes; were
they large enough to see, and know a Person

another Bailiff.

   [$Q.$] And you then told Mr. (^Elcock^) , you were 
forced to retreat?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I told him so, and so it was.
   [$Q.$] Is it the Practice, for the Names of the 
Sheriff's own Bailiffs, or those bound to the Sheriff, 
to be put into Warrants in the Office; and Blanks 
to be left in the same Warrants, for the Names of
other Bailiffs, to be put in by Attorneys, after the

because (^John Stevenson^) had drove the Bailiff from
the House, by snapping a Pistol at him.
   [$Q.$] Who told you, that the Prisoner had snapp'd 
a Pistol at the Bailiff?
   [$ (^A.^) $] (^John James^) the Bailiff told me so.
<P 24>
   [$Q.$] Did you see the Prisoner in the House, when 
you came there?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I did not.
   [$Q.$] Did you go with Mr. (^Elcock^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] How far were you from Mr. (^Elcock^) , when
you came to the House?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Within three or four Yards of him.
   [$Q.$] Then you did not see the Prisoner?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$Q.$] Did you see any People in the House, when
you came there?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, but I imagine People were in the House,
when Mr. (^Elcock^) and I came to it.
   [$Q.$] Did you hear any People in the House?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, We heard People, but saw no Body.
   [$Q.$] Were the Doors lock'd, or made fast?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes. The Doors were made.
   [$Q.$] When you came up to the House, did (^John
James^) give Mr. (^Elcock^) and you any Directions, about
the Business you were to do there?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, When we came up to the Door, (^John 
James^) ordered Mr. (^Elcock^) and me to attend that
Door.
   [$Q.$] Which Door was it?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It was the back Kitchen Door.
   [$Q.$] When you came to the Door, did Mr. 
(^Elcock^) say any thing to the People in the House?
   [$ (^A.^) $] As soon as we came to the Door, Mr. 
(^Elcock^) sayd, open the Door, -- open the Door, or we'll
break it down. -- I thought they were making the 
Door fast.
   [$Q.$] Was the Door opened?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$Q.$] What was done afterwards, when the 
People within would not open the Door?
<P 25>
   [$ (^A.^) $] As soon as Mr. (^Elcock^) said so, he bid me
strike an Iron-Crowe under the Door, in order to
lift it off the Hinges; and I accordingly put the
Crowe under the Door.
   [$Q.$] Was it Mr. (^Elcock^) , who ordered you to put
the Crowe under the Door?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] When you put the Crowe under the Door, 
pray, what happened?
   [$ (^A.^) $] As soon as I had put the Crowe, or Ringer
under the Door, Mr. (^Elcock^) sayd to me, (^John^) , run
to the other Door, for fear (^Stevenson^) gets out of
it; Whereupon, I left the Crowe sticking under
the Door upon the Sill, and went away towards the
other Door, and had not gone above three or four
Yards from the Door, before I heard a Gun go off.
   [$Q.$] Did you see Mr. (^Elcock^) when the Gun went
off?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Did he say any thing then?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes -- I heard him say; I am shot, I am shot.
And he fell on one Side of his Back down two
Steps. -- (^Richard Bowker^) and I took him up; --
Then Mr. (^Elcock^) took up his Shirt, and shewed us
the Wound.
   [$Q.$] Who was this (^Bowker^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He was an Assistant who came with me, to
re-take (^John Stevenson^) .
   [$Q.$] What did you do with Mr. (^Elcock^) , after you
and (^Bowker^) took him up?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He hung about our Shoulders, and we carried
him to a Wooden-Block, where he desired to rest.
   [$Q.$] You say he pulled up his Shirt, and shew'd
you his Wound, pray, on what Part of his Body
was he wounded?
<P 26>
   [$ (^A.^) $] He was wounded on the Side of the Belly,
above his Groin.
   [$Q.$] Were there any Holes in the Door where
the Ball came thro', besides that which the Ball
made? -- Did you see the Hole which the Bullet 
made?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I saw the Hole, which the Bullet came
through; and there was also a Slit in the Door,
which seemed big enough for a Person to see through.
And there were two Holes besides in the Door? 
   [$Q.$] How large were the two Holes that were in the
Door, besides that which the Bullet made?
   [$ (^A.^) $] One of the Holes was an Inch and half
Hole; the other bigger. But the Slit was afterwards
lath'd on the Inner-Side of the Door.
   [$Q.$] Could you have seen the Prisoner through
those Holes?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No doubt of it, if he had been opposite to
me when I looked through; but he was not, and
therefore I cou'd not see him.
   [$Q.$] Were you present when the Prisoner 
surrendred himself?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I was
   [$Q$] Had he any Fire-Arms in the House, when
he surrendred?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He had Fire-Arms at that Time. I fired
off one of the Pistols, the Day after the Prisoner
killed Mr. (^Elcock^) .
   [$Q.$] What Day of the Month was that?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The twenty second of (^March^) . Mr. (^Elcock^)
received his mortal Wound upon the twenty-first,
about Three o'Clock.
   [$Q.$] What other Fire-Arms had the Prisoner,
when he surrendred, besides the Pistol you fired?
   [$ (^A.^) $] There were two Pistols; -- one besides that,
which I fired; and a Gun.
<P 27> 
   [$Q.$] Were they loaden?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] How do you know they were loaden?
   [$ (^A.^) $] That Pistol which I fired off, was very heavy 
loaded: The other Pistol was discharged against
an Ash-Tree, and I saw the Hole which the bullet
had made in the Tree; and the Gun was fired into
the Air.
   [$Q.$] When the Prisoner surrendred himself, did
he acknowledge, that he had Fire-Arms in the
House?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He sayd, he had but one Pistol. -- But the
Woman in the House being asked, whether there
were any more Fire-Arms; she told them, there
was another Pistol and a Gun.
   [$Q.$] You say, you discharged one of the Pistols
yourself; Did you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I did, and fired it into the Air.
   [$Q.$] Did you see the Pistol discharged against the
Ash-Tree?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I did; and look'd at the Hole, which the
Ball had made. -- The Gun was fired into the Air.

   [$Counsel for the Prisoner.$]
   [$Q.$] When you came to re-take the Prisoner with
Mr. (^Elcock^) , what Orders did (^John James^) give you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He ordered Mr. (^Elcock^) and me to stay at the
Door; and he ran to the other.
   [$Q.$] What Orders had (^John Jones^) received; Was
he to have no Hand in re-taking the Prisoner?
   [$ (^A.^) $] (^John Jones^) was ordered by (^John James^) , to
attend a Woman, (^Stevenson's^) House-keeper, I 
believe, and not let her come near him.
   [$Q.$] Was neither (^John James^) , nor (^John Jones^) ,
<P 28>

were stationed, in order to re-take the Prisoner?

   [$Q.$] Do you know the Prisoner at the bar?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, very well.
   [$Q.$] Do you remember any thing, about the
Prisoner's discharging or firing a Gun at any time?
pray, speak up, that the Jury may hear you, and
acquaint them, with what you know of the
Matter.
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, Sir, I was in Mr. (^Stevenson's^) House at
(^Bickerton^) , when Mr. (^Elcock^) was shot.
   [$Q.$] What Part of the House were you in, at 
that Time?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I was in the House-Place, and Mr. (^Stevenson^)
was in the back Kitchen.
   [$Q.$] Was any Body in the House, besides the
Prisoner and yourself?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes. A Woman was in the House. -- A 
Servant-Woman.
   [$Q.$] Did you see the Prisoner fire the Gun?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Prisoner did fire the Gun, at the back
Door, and brought it in afterwards, and took it into
the Parlour.
<P 29>
   [$Q.$] After the Gun was fired, did you hear no
Noise out of Doors; Was there no Alarm made
about it?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes. The People without shouted, Murder.
   [$Q.$] From what Place did the Prisoner take the
Gun, which he fired?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He took it from the Mantle-Piece in the 
Kitchen.
   [$Q.$] Was the Prisoner accustomed to keep 
Fire-Arms in the House with him?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot tell.
   [$Q.$] How long was it after the Gun was fired, that
you heard the People shout, Murder?
   [$ (^A.^) $] In about a Minute, or two, after
the Gun was fired.
   [$Q.$] I suppose, you were curious enough after
the Gun was fired, and you heard the Cry of 
Murder, to know, Whether any Body was hurt, or
not; Were not you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I went to a Window, and look'd out; and
saw a Man in blue Cloaths supported, or held up
between two Men.
   [$Q.$] Did you say nothing to the Prisoner, upon
this Occasion?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes; I told Mr. (^Stevenson^) , that I believed
there was never a Man killed, but there was one
hurt, and they called him Mr. (^Elcock^) .
   [$Q.$] And pray, when you told the Prisoner, there 
was never a Man killed, but a Man hurt, and his
Name was Mr. (^Elcock^) ; what did he say to you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He sayd, I don't know what Business a Man
of his Coat, had among such Men as those. I am
glad of it.
   [$Q.$] What do you apprehend he meant, by the
Words "A Man of his Coat"?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I don't know.
<P 30>
   [$Counsel for the Prisoner.$]
   You will please to observe, The Witness told the
Prisoner, there was a Man hurt, but no Body
killed; and that was immediately before the Prisoner
sayd, he was glad of it. Glad, that no Body was
killed.

   [$Q.$] I think you are a Surgeon?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, Sir.
   [$Q.$] Where do you live?
   [$ (^A.^) $] At (^Nantwich^) .
   [$Q.$] Did you know the deceased, Mr. (^Francis
Elcock^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, very well.
   [$Q.$] Were you sent for at any time, and when,
to attend Mr. (^Elcock^) upon Account of his having
received a Wound, by the firing of a Gun, or
otherwise? -- Pray acquaint the Court, and Jury,
with what you know of this Matter?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Upon (^Wednesday^) the twenty-first Day of
(^March^) last, a Messenger came to me, about Three
o'Clock in the Afternoon, desiring me to go to
(^Bickerton^) , to Mr. (^Francis Elcock^) , who, the 
Messenger told me, was shot. -- I went accordingly
with the Man, and got to (^Bickerton^) about Five
o'Clock in the Evening. When I came there, I
found, that Mr. (^Rowe^) , a Surgeon from (^Malpas^) ,
had been sent for likewise, and had been there, for
some time before. Mr (^Rowe^) and I went up Stairs
together, to the Room, where Mr. (^Elcock^) was, and
We found him ill in Bed. Almost so soon as he
<P 31>
saw me, he pulled up his Shirt, and shewed me
where the Ball was lodged, [^COMMA FAINT IN SOURCE TEXT^] and seemed #
impatient
to have it taken out: Upon seeing the Wound, I
took the Ball, between my Finger and Thumb, and
perceived, I cou'd easily dislodge it. I then 
examin'd the Wound, where the Ball had entred, and
found it cut about two Inches from the Hip on the 
left Side of his Belly: it pass'd thro' his Belly, by
his Bowels no doubt, and lodged five or six Inches
below his right Hip, almost through the Skin. As
soon as I saw this, I took Mr. (^Rowe^) into another
Room, to consult, what was fittest to be done;
and I told him, it was my Opinion, that Mr. (^Elcock^)
was a dying Man, and that I did not know, 
whether it would be of any Use, to take the Ball away,
altho' it could be so easily effected -- But, 
considering, that it wou'd give him some Satisfaction,
and perhaps Ease too, by taking the Ball from the
Place where it did lie, Mr. (^Rowe^) and I went into
the Room again, and I took out the Ball. -- After
I had taken the Ball out, and dressed the Wound,
and put a Bandage about it, I asked Mr. (^Elcock^) ,
how he did? He sayd he was easier. Doctor (^Hayes^)
came in afterwards, and when I had told him, the
Nature of the Wound, he look'd upon the Case to
be extremely dangerous. The Doctor stayd with
him two or three Hours and then went away; but
Mr. (^Elcock^) desired me and Mrs. (^Nevill^) to sit with
him, which we did, and his Father did so too, till
ten Minutes past Three the next Morning, and he
then expired. [$-- The Witness produces the Ball.$]
   [$Q.$] Do you believe, that the Wound which
Mr. (^Elcock^) received, was the Occasion of his Death?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I firmly believe, that the Wound which he
received was the Occasion of his Death.
<P 32>
   [$Q.$] Did Mr. (^Elcock^) say any thing to you in his
Agonies, upon the melancholy Occasion, and
what?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Mr. (^Elcock^) told me, that he was shot, as he
was stooping down, with a Crowe in his Hand,
striving to open the Prisoner's Door?
   [$Q.$] Did he tell you, from what Part of the House 
he was shot?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He sayd, he received the Wound at the
Door of the Prisoner's House?
   [$Q.$] Pray, how came the Ball to be made so flat:
in that uncommon Form?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I believe its going through the Door, was
the Occasion of its being in that Form.
[$ (^Then the Witness with-drew.^) $]

   [$Cryer,$] call Mr. (^Baxter^) .

[$Mr. (^Robert Baxter^) sworn.$]

   [$Counsel for the Crown.$]
   [$Q.$] Pray, Mr. (^Baxter^) , Are you concern'd in
any, and what Manner, for Mr. (^Harrison^) , the
present Sheriff of the County of (^Chester^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, Sir, I am concerned for the Sheriff,
and keep his Office.
   [$Q.$] Do you make out Warrants for the Sheriff?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I do.
   [$Q.$] Did you receive at any time, and when, a 
Writ against the Prisoner, at the Suit of (^John
Atkin^) ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I received a Writ against him upon the First
of (^March^) last. [$ (which he produces.) $]
   [$Q.$] Look upon that Warrant. -- Did you make
out that Warrant upon the Writ, in order to arrest
the Prisoner?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I did.
<P 33>
   [$Q.$] And are you sure, that is the same Warrant
you did make out?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes; I am sure it is.
   [$The Writ was read, and upon the Back of it,
was written, "Take Bail for Eighteen Pounds Eight
Shillings and Ten-pence Half-Penny, by Affidavit
filed," -- And another Indorsement, viz. -- "I 
promise to indemnify the Sheriff, in the Execution of
the Writ, as to the special Bailiffs. (^John Atkin.^) "$]
   [$Q.$] Is it usual for the Sheriff to appoint a 
Gentleman in this Town to execute the Office, and to act
for him?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is usual. -- I have been several Times 
appointed myself.
   [$Q.$] Do you receive all the Writs that are sued 
out directed to the Sheriff of this County?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I do.
   [$Q.$] And do you make out the Warrants upon
such Writs?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I do.
   [$Q.$] And return the Writs?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Do you execute all other Acts, that the
Sheriff would do, if he resided here himself?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes. Except attending the Assizes and 
Sessions.
   [$Q.$] And has this been the constant Practice in
this County?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, during all my Time.
   [$Q.$] Has it been usual, when Plaintiffs would
have special Bailiffs appointed, to leave Blanks in 
the Warrants for their Names to be inserted?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, upon the Sheriff being indemnified.
   [$Q.$] Have you done this yourself?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Have you known others to do it?
<P 34>
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, several others to my Knowledge.
   [$Q.$] Did you ever know it to be refused?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, never, upon the Sheriff being 
indemnified, and the Attorney is known to be a fair 
Practicer. -- I have known it refused, where the 
Practicer was not liked, or where the Sheriff run
any Risque or Hazard, and the Indemnity was not
approved; But when the Attorney, or Practicer,
and the Indemnity are liked, it is usually done.
   [$Q.$] Pray, what is the Nature of the Indemnity
given to the Sheriff upon this Occasion?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is, that he should not suffer by Escapes
or Rescues.
   [$Q.$] And has this been the constant Practice used
by the Persons, who have acted in the Sheriff's
Office, in the Capacity you now act?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It has been so, all the time I have known
the Office.
   [$Q.$] How long, pray, is that?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Seven or eight and twenty Years.
   [$Q.$] To leave Blanks in the Warrants, for the
Names of the special Bailiffs to be inserted?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Pray, Whether is such Practice convenient 
to the Plaintiffs and Suitors in the Court, or 
inconvenient to them?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is look'd upon to be very convenient for
the Plaintiffs.
   [$Q.$] Do you think so yourself?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I look upon it in that Light.
   [$Q.$] Had Mr. (^Lowe^) , or Mr. (^Elcock^) , or both of 
them a Right, to insert the Names of the special
Bailiffs, in the Blank left in the Warrant, whereon
the Prisoner was arrested?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I apprehend, either Mr. (^Lowe^) , or Mr. (^Elcock^)
had a Right to do so?
<P 35>
   [$Q.$] Is it usual for Attornies in the Country, to
send their Directions to their Agents in (^Chester^) to
take out Writs?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] And is the Agent's Name generally put to
the Writ, or the Name of the Attorney in the 
Country only?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Agent's Name is generally added to the 
Name of the Country Attorney, in the Writ, since
the late Act of Parliament for that Purpose; but
before that, the Name of the Attorney was only 
put to the Writ.
    [$Q.$] And you say that either Mr. (^Lowe^) , or Mr. 
(^Elcock^) , had a Right to insert the Names of the
special Bailiffs?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes. I apprehend so.

[$ (^Cross-examined.^) $]

   [$Counsel for the Prisoner.$]
   [$Q.$] Do not the Attornies, and other Persons,
usually send the Names of the special Bailiffs, to 
be inserted in the Warrants, by the Sheriff, or by
those who act for him?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Sometimes People do send the Names of
the special Bailiffs, to be inserted.
   [$Q.$] Has it not been the most usual Way, in
your Time, to do so?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It was when I first knew the Office the most
usual Way, in 1732 and 1733. -- But Warrants
went out with Blanks then.
   [$Q.$] Did (^John Evans^) , the Bailiff named in the
Warrant, indemnify the Sheriff?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He has given Security to the Sheriff, I 
believe. -- But the Indemnity was for the special
Bailiffs.
<P 36> 
   [$Q.$] In the year 1732, or 1733, Were blank 
Warrants sent out, and not the Names of the 
special Bailiffs inserted?
   [$ (^A.^) $] When I was concerned for Mr. (^Page^) , who
was Sheriff in 1732 or 1733, several blank 
Warrants were sent out, and not the special Bailiffs 
inserted.
   [$Q.$] How many Warrants were sent out, with
Blanks for the Names of the special Bailiffs, in Mr.
(^Page's^) Time?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I cannot tell.
   [$Q.$] Were not Warrants oftner delivered, with
the Names of the special Bailiffs inserted in the
Office, before they were sent out, than Warrants
with Blanks, for the Names of the special Bailiffs,
to be afterwards inserted by the Attornies?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I believe, Warrants were oftner sent out,
with the Names of the special Bailiffs inserted,
than with Blanks.
   [$Q.$] Is that the Warrant, you made out on the 
Writ the First of (^March^) against the Prisoner?
   [$A.$] [$Looks at the Warrant.$] It is the same 
Warrant.
   [$Q.$] Is it in the same Situation it was, when you
delivered it out of your Hands?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No.
   [$Q.$] How has it been altered? how does it differ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Names, (^John James^) , and (^John Jones^) ,
have been since inserted.
   [$Q.$] Pray, was the Seal to the Warrant before
you delivered it out of your Hands?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Are you sure of that?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, for I put the Seal to it myself.
<P 37>
   [$Court.$] Do you remember, that any Arrest was
ever set aside, or disputed, on Account of a Blank
Warrant having been sent out?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, never.

   [$Counsel for the Prisoner.$]
   [$Q.$] Through all the Course of your Practice, has
it not been most usual, to make out Warrants, after
you received the Names of the special Bailiffs, than
without them; -- than making out blank Warrants?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes, it has been most usual, I think.
   [$Q.$] When the Names of the special Bailiffs are
sent, Do you always insert them in the Warrants?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes. I do.
   [$Q.$] Pray, how is the Under-Sheriff of (^Cheshire^)
appointed?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He is appointed by the Sheriff, by Deed.
   [$Q.$] Have you any written Authority from the
Sheriff?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No further, than by Letters sent me 
sometimes, about the Business of the Office.
   [$Q.$] How were you appointed?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Night before the Sheriff was sworn, I
supped with him, and it was agreed, I shou'd act
for him.
   [$Q.$] Who were present, when you were 
appointed, to act for the Sheriff?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The Sheriff, and the Under-Sheriff, were both
present, and appointed me.
   [$Q.$] Were you appointed by any Instrument in
Writing, or not?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I was not.
   [$Q.$] Is it usual for the Sheriff and Under-Sheriff,
both to appoint an Agent, to act for the Sheriff?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I believe, the usual Way is by the 
Under-Sheriff only.
<P 38>
   [$Q.$] Is there no other Method of appointing a
Person, to act for the Sheriff, but by Parol?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I don't know of any other Way.
   [$Q.$] Is the Seal to the Writ, the Seal of Office?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is.
   [$Q.$] Have the Persons concern'd for the Sheriff
of this County, usually that Sort of Seal?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Where had you this Seal?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I had this from Mr. (^Griffith^) , having lost my
own.

[$ (^Then the Witness with-drew.^) $]

   [$Mr. (^Gastrell^) , Clerk to Mr. (^Lowe^) , an Attorney
in (^Chester^) , was then called, to prove that (^John
Atkin^) signed the Indemnity given to the Sheriff,
when the blank Warrant against the Prisoner was

examine him.$]

   [$Q.$] Are you acquainted with the Method of
suing out Process, in the Court of Session for this
County?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
   [$Q.$] Is it usual, to send out Warrants, from the
Sheriff's Office, with Blanks for the Names of the
special Bailiffs to be inserted?
   [$ (^A.^) $] When special Bailiffs are desired, Warrants
frequently issue with Blanks, for their Names to
be inserted.
   [$Q.$] Do you know this to be frequently done?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes.
<P 39>
   [$Counsel for the Prisoner.$]
   [$Q.$] But is it not more usual, for the Names of
the special Bailiffs to be put into the Warrants, in
the Office, before they are sent out, than, for 
Warrants to issue with Blanks, for Bailiffs to be inserted
afterwards?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Sometimes the Names of the special Bailiffs
are inserted in the Office.
   [$Q.$] I say, is it not oftner done? more 
frequently?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I don't know but it may.

   [$Counsel for the Crown.$]
   [$Q.$] Don't you think it prudent, sometimes not
to send the Names of the special Bailiffs to the
Office? -- to conceal the Names till they are inserted
by the Attorney?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I do.

   [$Q.$] Did your Father ever act as Agent for the
Sheriff of this County?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He did.
   [$Q.$] Was it customary for your Father, to send
out Warrants with Blanks, for the Names of the
special Bailiffs to be inserted afterwards?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He did leave Blanks often in the Warrants.
   [$Q.$] I suppose you understood, that your Father
had Authority so to do?
   [$ (^A.^) $] I always understood, that he had Authority
to do it.

   [$Counsel for the Prisoner.$]
   [$Q.$] But did your Father never refuse, to send
out blank Warrants, to your Knowledge?
<P 40>
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yes; he sometimes did, when he suspected
the Attorney; but never, when he knew the 
Attorney to be a fair Practicer.
