<P 86C1>
   [$After the reading of the Indictment, the Clerk
of the Crown said to the Duke;$] How say'st thou,
<P 86C2>
(^Thomas^) Duke of (^Norfolk^) , art thou guilty of these
Treasons whereof thou art indicted, in manner and
form as thou art thereof indicted, Yea or No?
   [$Thereupon the Duke began, and said to this
effect:$]
   May it please your Grace and you the rest of
my Lords here, The hearing of this Indictment
giveth me occasion to enter into the making of a
Suit, which I meant not to have done before my
coming hither: I beseech you, If the Law will
permit it, that I may have Counsel allow'd me for
the answering of this Indictment.
   [$The Lord Chief Justice answer'd, That in case
of High-Treason he cannot have Counsel allow'd:
And that he was to answer to his own Fact only,
which himself best knew, and might without
Counsel sufficiently answer.$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] That you may understand that I speak it
not without some ground, these be the Causes that
move me to make this Suit: I was told before I
came here, that I was indicted upon the Statute of
the 25th of (^Edward^) III. I have had very short
warning to provide to answer so great a matter;
I have not had fourteen Hours in all, both day
and night, and now I neither hear the same
Statute alleg'd, and yet I am put at once to the
whole Herd of Laws, not knowing which
Particularity to answer unto. The Indictment
containeth sundry Points and Matters to touch me by
Circumstance, and so to draw me into matter of
Treason, which are not Treasons themselves:
Therefore with Reverence and humble Submission
I am led to think I may have Counsel. And this
I shew, that you may think I move not this Suit
without any ground. I am hardly handled, I have
had short warning, and no Books; neither Book
of Statutes, nor so much as the Breviate of
Statutes. I am brought to fight without a Weapon:
yet I remember one Case in Law, I think it is
in the first Year of King (^Henry^) VII. It is the
Case of one (^Humphrey Stafford^) , which was
indicted of High Treason, and had Counsel
allowed him: If the Precedent of this Case be such, as
it may extend to me, I require it at your hands,
that I may have it allow'd: I shew you my ground
why I crave it, I refer me to your Opinions therein.
   [$Then Sir (^James Dyer^) , Lord Chief Justice of the
Common-Pleas, said;$] My Lord, That Case of
(^Humphrey Stafford^) in (^ (\primo\) ^) of (^Henry^) VII. was about
pleading of Sanctuary, for that he was taken out of
Sanctuary at (^Culneham^) , which belong'd to the
Abbot of (^Abingdon^) : So the Question was whether he
should be allow'd Sanctuary in that Case, and with
that Form of Pleading, which was Matter of
Law: In which Case he had Counsel, and not
upon the Point of Fact of High-Treason; but
only for the Allowance of Sanctuary, and whether
it might be allow'd, being claim'd by Prescription
and without shewing any former Allowances in
(^Eier^) , and such like Matters; but all our Books
do forbid allowing of Counsel in the Point of
Treason; but only it is to be answer'd Guilty, or
Not Guilty.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Humphrey Stafford's^) Case was
High-Treason, and he had Counsel. I must submit my self
to your Opinions: I beseech you, weigh what
Case I stand in. I stand here before you for my
Life, Lands and Goods, my Children and my
Posterity, and that which I esteem most of all, for my
Honesty; I forbear to speak of my Honour. I am
unlearn'd: if I ask any thing, and not in such
Words as I ought, I beseech you bear with me, and
let me have that Favour that the Law allows me.
<P 87C1>
If the Law do not allow me Counsel, I must
submit me to your Opinions. I beseech you, consider 
of me; my Blood will ask Vengeance, if I be
unjustly condemn'd: I honour your Learnings and
your Gravities: I beseech you, have Consideration
of me, and grant me what the Law will permit
me. I am now to make another Suit to you, my
Lords the Judges: I beseech you, tell me, if my
Indictment be perfect and sufficient in Law; and
whether in Whole, or in the Parts, and in which
Parts, that I may know to what I should answer.
   [$Lord Chief Justice (^Catlin.^) The Lord Ch. Justice
said,$] For the Sufficiency of your Indictment, it
hath been well debated and consider'd by us all;
and we have all, with one Assent, resolv'd, and so
do certify you, that if the Causes in the
Indictment express'd, be true in Fact, the Indictment is
wholly and in every Part sufficient.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Be all the Points Treasons?
   [$L. Ch. Just. (^Catlin.^) $] All be Treasons, if the
Truth of the Case be so in Fact.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I will tell you what moveth me to ask you
this: I have heard of the Case of the Lord (^Scroope^) ;
it was in the time of (^Henry^) the IVth [$ (^ (the Judges
said Henry the Vth) ^) $] he confess'd the Indictment,
and yet travers'd that the Points thereof were no
Treasons.
   [$L. Ch. Just. (^Catlin.^) $] My Lord, he had his
Judgment for Treason upon that Indictment, and was
executed.
   [$Then the Clerk of the Crown said again,$] How
sayest thou, (^Thomas^) Duke of (^Norfolk^) , art thou
guilty of the Treasons whereof thou art here indicted,
in Manner and Form as thou art indicted, Yea,
or No?
   [$The Duke answer'd,$] Not Guilty.
   [$The Clerk said,$] By whom wilt thou be try'd?
   [$The Duke said,$] By God and my Peers.

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 89C1>
   [$ (^Duke.^) Then the Duke ask'd, if all the Treasons
contain'd in his Indictment were upon the Statute
of King (^Edward^) III. and it was answered by Mr.
(^Serjeant^) and Mr. (^Attorney-General^) , that they were
grounded upon the same Statute only. Then the
Duke began thus:$]
   Here the Matters that Mr. (^Serjeant^) hath prov'd
against me stand in two Points; by which he
chargeth me with imagining the Deprivation and
Death of the Queen's Majesty, and with indirect
and untrue Dealing in the (^Scotish^) Queen's Cause;
and therein he burdeneth me with Perjury. The
(^Scotish^) Cause hath divers Pleas, and therefore
bear with me, I pray you, if I cast back again to
rehearse my Doing therein, for my Memory is not
good: As for my Dealing therein, God is my
Witness, that I have done uprightly.
   [$ (^Serj.^) Then Mr. (^Serjeant^) urged him to confess if
he had knowledge that the (^Scotish^) Queen pretended
Title to the present Possession of the Crown of
(^England^) ; offering, if the Duke would deny it, to
make proof of it.$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) The Duke said,$] I will make mine own
Confession; I pray you teach me not how to
answer or confess, because it is the first ground that
you build upon against me: and because I know
not whether my Peers do all know it or no, I will
make a short Declaration of my Doings in that
Matter with the (^Scotish^) Queen.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] First we pray your Grace [$ (speaking to the
Lord High Steward) $] that he may directly
answer, whether he knew that the (^Scotish^) Queen so
claim'd or no; if he say no, we will prove it.
   [$ (^Duke.^) Then being ruled over by the Lord High
Steward, that he should answer directly to that
Question, he answer'd, that indeed he knew that
she had so claim'd, but with Circumstance.$]
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Say plainly, Did you know it or no? for
if you say nay, we can prove it.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] You handle me hardly, you would so trap
me by Circumstance, and infer upon me that she
<P 89C2>
was the Queen's Enemy, and so make me a
Traitor. I will answer directly to the whole Matter
of my Dealing with her.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Answer to the parts as they fall out. Did
you know that she claim'd the present Possession of
the Crown? That she usurp'd the Arms and Royal
Style of this Realm? And that she made no
Renunciation of that usurp'd Pretence? If you say you 
knew it not, we will prove every part of it.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I did not know it in such sort as is
alledg'd; I know that Renunciation of that Claim
was offer'd, and upon certain Causes respited.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] It is well known, and your self then knew
it, That the (^Scotish^) Queen claim'd the present
Possession of the Crown of (^England^) , quarter'd the
Arms of (^England^) with the Arms of (^Scotland^) , and
usurp'd the Style of this Realm; and that there
was a (^French^) Power sent to prosecute it, by
invading this Land by the way of (^Scotland^) : your self
was made the Queen's Majesty's Lieutenant, and
levy'd and Army to expulse them. Afterward the
Queen's Majesty sent her Embassadors, which
met with the (^French^) Lords and (^Scotish^) Queen's
Commissioners at (^Edinburgh^) , and agreed upon a
Treaty of Peace; in which one special Article
was, that the (^Scotish^) Queen should acknowledge
her Error, and should renounce her pretended
Claim to the present Possession of the Crown of
this Realm. It was not done, nor yet is done.
My Lord of (^Norfolk^) was at this Treaty; and
when this last Commission went out, when the
Commissioners sat at (^York^) about the Matter
between the (^Scotish^) Queen, her Son, and the
Nobilty of (^Scotland^) , wherein were Commissioners the
Duke of (^Norfolk^) , the Earl of (^Sussex^) , and Mr.
(^Chancellor^) of the Dutchy; one special Instruction was
for the (^Scotish^) Queen's Recognition of her unjust
Claim, and to require that she should ratify the
said former Treaty of Peace. The Duke knoweth
well it was not done.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] What is this to me? I need not enter to
defend her Doings, I like them not. It is not my
Case, but that you make it my Case; else I would
not meddle with it, answer it who would for me.
Indeed I have heard, that being Covert-Baron
then, marry'd to the (^French^) King, in her Husband's
Life she made Claim to the Crown of (^England^) ,
and quarter'd the Arms of (^England^) with the Arms
of (^Scotland^) . I have heard also, That Sir (^Nicholas
Throckmorton^) made Complaint thereof, and mov'd
for Redress, and thereupon it was laid down. I
have heard that she hath been requested to make
Renunciation of that Claim when the Peace was
concluded, when (^Montmorancy^) came over, and time
was taken for it. After this there grew Amity
between the Queen's Majesty and the (^Scotish^) Queen;
the Queen took her for her Friend, sent Embassadors
unto her, and christned her Child; all this excluded
Enmity. And when my Lord of (^Bedford^) was there,
and mov'd her for ratifying of the Treaty, and for
the Renunciation, she refus'd not; but said, she
would send to shew Causes why she did it not
presently. And then it was refused not absolutely, but
upon certain Words, and the treating thereof
committed to my Lord (^Burleigh^) and Mr. (^Wotton^) . As
for our Commission at (^York^) , it took no end; the
Matter was brought up hither, and here was sat
upon at (^Westminster^) in the Parliament-Chamber.
And this is my understanding, that she claim'd the
Crown, and I have not otherwise known it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Thus have you confess'd far enough, That
you knew that she did pretend Title to the
<P 90C1>
present Possession of the Crown; That she quarter'd the
Arms, and usurp'd the Royal Style of this Realm.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] It was in her Husband's time, when she
was Covert-Baron.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] You knew also, how since her Husband's
Time, she hath not renounc'd that Claim; and you
had, in special, Instruction to require it when you
were Commissioner.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] A full Renunciation was offer'd when the
Lord (^Burleigh^) was with her, and our Commission
was ended, and the Matter brought up hither.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] But what was the Cause why it took no
end by your Commission: Your self was the Cause
that the Commission broke up, because you dealt
indirectly; you set out your own Affection and
Partiality, and behav'd your self partially, without
regard to the Queen's Majesty's special
Commandment, without regard of your Oath, then specially
taken for that Commission, or of your Oath as a
Counsellor: you utter'd your Partiality, you
disclos'd to the other side aforehand the Queen's
Secrets: you devis'd with the one side, and gave
them Counsel how to deal for stay of the Matter:
you did prevaricate the Queen's Intention; and
when you were by your Commission to examine the
(^Scotish^) Queen's Adulteries, and her Murdering of
her Husband, you practis'd with those that were
Dealers for the (^Scotish^) Queen, and you told them,
by way of Advice, That if these Matters went
forwards to Hearing, the Earl (^Murray^) , and his
Side, would disclose all the foul Matter that they
could, both by her Letters and other Evidences,
to her Dishonour; and that the Queen's Majesty
had some such Counsellors about her, as if these
things were once produc'd, she would cause them to
be publish'd, that all foreign Princes should
understand them, to the (^Scotish^) Queen's great Infamy,
and to move foreign Princes to proceed no
further suing for her. And this was the Cause of the
Breach and Dissolution of your Commission.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] You said you would prove that I knew
of the (^Scotish^) Queen's claiming the present
Possession of the Crown.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Your self have confessed it; for you know
there was yet no Renunciation made, and you
were special Commissioner for that purpose; and
tho your Commission took no effect, yet by that,
that the requiring of the Renunciation was matter
of your Instructions, and the same not done, it is
plain that you knew sufficiently of her former unjust
claiming of the present Possession of the Crown:
And now will we by good Evidence prove your
partial and indirect dealing in that Commission.
Here I will produce Matter of your own Conference
at (^York^) with (^Ledington^) and the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , and
how your self told them, that you understood at
(^Lyth^) , that rigorous Matter would be set out by the
Earl (^Murray^) and the rest of that Side, against the
(^Scotish^) Queen, touching her Whoredom and the
Murder of her Husband. You gave Advice to stay
the Earl of (^Murray^) from so doing; you told the
(^Scotish^) Queen's Ministers, how the Queen of
(^England^) had some Counsellors that could cause her to
publish all those Matters to the (^Scotish^) Queen's
Infamy; you practis'd with them to devise to qualify
the Matter; you told the Way that you thought
best to do it; you advis'd them to deal with the
Earl of (^Murray^) , that the Matter might be
compounded, or else so to handle it, that it might
take no end.
   [$ (^Duke.^) Here the Duke took advantage of that
Mr. Serjeant had said, That the Duke understood
<P 90C2>
at (^Lyth^) ; for the Duke then protested, that at that
time he had never been at (^Lyth^) . Whereupon the
Lord (^Burleigh^) dissolv'd that Knot, and said on the
Duke's behalf to Mr. Serjeant:$]
   [$ (^Burleigh.^) $] You were best proceed with your
Evidence; you may mistake: my Lord (^Norfolk^) had
not then been at (^Lyth^) , otherwise than he and I were
there once secretly in a Morning. The Cause of
this Error rose thus: In one (^Scotish^) Paper produc'd
for that Matter, was contain'd, how the Duke
understood at (^Lyth^) , which in (^Scotch^) is as much as at
(^length^) ; which Mr. Serjeant, in perusing the
Matters for Evidence deliver'd unto him, took for (^Lyth^) ,
as the Clerk of the Crown also afterwards did in
reading the same Paper.
[^DEPOSITION OF THE BISHOP OF ROSSE OMITTED.^]
<P 91C2>
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] The Effect of all, is the Duke's partial
and untrue Dealing; for that before the Bishop
of (^Rosse's^) going to (^York^) , the (^Scotish^) Queen
declar'd to the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , That she doubted
not of the Favour of the Duke of (^Norfolk^) ; for
she told him that my Lady (^Scroope^) had by
Motions and Means assur'd her of his good Will,
and she doubted not of my Lord of (^Sussex's^) ,
for the great Friendship and tender Love he bare
to the Duke; and she made account that Mr.
(^Sadler^) would be friendly, for that he alone would
not stand to them both. It appeareth also
for further proof of his partial Dealing, that tho
he were sworn, both as a Counsellor to the
Queen's Majesty, and also specially for the
Matter of this Commission; yet he
indirectly, secretly, and underhand, dealt with
(^Ledington^) , and told him, how that the Earl of (^Murray^)
and his Side intended to utter sharp Matter
against the (^Scotish^) Queen. The Duke gave his
Advice how to stay it, and so dealt partially,
and against the Queen's Majesty's special Trust
and Commandment, and against his own Oath
and Promise. Next after that, in Conference
<P 92C1>
had with the Duke of (^Norfolk^) on the (^Scotish^) Queen's
part, the Duke declar'd his good Will that he
bare to the (^Scotish^) Queen: He shewed how, that
if the same matter of Evidence against her, were
once utter'd by the Earl of (^Murray^) , some of the
Queen's Majesty's Counsellors of (^England^) would
procure her Majesty to publish them. He
advised that the matter should be compounded with the
Earl of (^Murray^) ; and that he should not stick,
being here in (^England^) , and not at her own liberty,
for the present time, to be content to ratify the
Dimission of the Crown of (^Scotland^) , which she
made at (^Lochlevin^) ; and so she might be restor'd
into her own Country, and then she might undo
all again at her pleasure: and upon pretence of
Constraint and Fear, as well revoke that which she
should do in (^England^) , as she before revoked that
which she had done at (^Lochlevin^) in (^Scotland^) . Also
the Duke at that time was privy to the Device,
that (^Ledington^) accompany'd the Earl (^Murray^) only
to understand his Secrets, and to betray him; and
that (^Ledington^) stole away the Letters, and kept
them one Night, and caus'd his Wife to write them
out. Howbeit, the same were but Copies
translated out of (^French^) into (^Scotch^) ; which, when
(^Ledington's^) Wife had written out, he caus'd them
to be sent to the (^Scotish^) Queen: She labour'd to
translate them again into (^French^) , as near as she
could to the Originals wherein she wrote them;
but that was not possible to do, but there was
some Variance in the Phrase; by which Variance,
as God would, the Subtilty of that Practice came
to light.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] What if all this be true? What is this
to the Matter? Any dealing of mine with the
(^Scotish^) Queen by my Sister (^Scroope's^) Means, I
utterly deny. As for (^Ledington^) , and the Bishop of
(^Rosse^) , what their Speeches were to me, I care not;
I am to answer but for mine own Speeches.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] The Bishop of (^Rosse^) accuseth you of your
own Speeches, and this he doth, being examin'd
freely, and without Compulsion.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] He is a (^Scot^) .
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] A (^Scot^) is a Christian Man.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] At my being at (^York^) in Commission,
(^Ledington^) broke with me himself to have the
Matter compounded between the (^Scotish^) Queen and
the Earl of (^Murray^) . I told him that our
Commission was only to hear indifferently what should
be alledg'd on both parts, and thereof truly to
make report. What hurt is this? The Bishop of
(^Rosse^) afterwards sent for me, that he might speak
with me: when we met, he moved me for the
compounding of the Matter, as (^Ledington^) had done.
I told him, that our Commission was but to hear
and report, as I had told (^Ledington^) before; and
therefore if they would fall to compounding, I will'd
them to devise the Means themselves, and to make
Offers; and thereupon we would advertise the
Queen's Majesty thereof, as we would of all the
Matters alledg'd. If it be otherwise, and as you
say, let my Letters be look'd on, and see if they
contain any such Matter. If the Bishop of (^Rosse^) ,
for Fear or for Malice, have said untruly; if being
a (^Scot^) , he care not how many (^English^) Men, by his
false Testimony, he bring to destruction; I beseech
you let not that hurt me.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] You made the first Motion of
compounding the Matter to (^Ledington^) your self; and another
time to the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , you offer'd to further
it all that you could.
<P 92C2>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I never saw the Bishop of (^Rosse^) before
I came to (^York^) ; and would I, think you, deal so
dangerously with a (^Scot^) that I never saw before?
Also, I did by my Letters signify to the Queen's
Majesty our Proceeding, and my misliking of the
(^Scotish^) Queen's part: Let that Letter be seen;
which Letter was written after my Talk with
(^Ledington^) . I wrote it when I went from (^York^) , and I
never saw the Bishop of (^Rosse^) afterward, till I came
to (^London^) .
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] The writing of your Letters to the Queen's
Majesty, wherein you advertis'd against the (^Scotish^)
Queen, and tho the same were written after your
Conference with (^Ledington^) and the Bishop of (^Rosse^) ,
is no proof but that you dealt partially for the
(^Scotish^) Queen; for those Letters were written by
other, as well as your self, namely, by my Lord
of (^Sussex^) , and Mr. Chancellor of the Dutchy:
and you could not otherwise do, but to signify,
notwithstanding your partial secret Dealing; for
else you should have too openly bewray'd your
Intention.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] When (^Ledington^) mov'd me of the
Marriage of the (^Scotish^) Queen, I utterly refus'd it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] That is not so: And for proof, as well of
your partial Dealing in the Commission as for the
Marriage, there shall be brought forth sufficient
Evidence.
   [$Here was alledg'd how a Letter had been
written to the Earl of (^Murray^) , requiring to be
advertis'd by him of so much as he knew concerning
the Doings of the Duke of (^Norfolk^) , both for the 
Matter of the Commission, and the Practice of his
Marriage with the (^Scotish^) Queen: And the Earl
(^Murray's^) Answer to the same Letter was produc'd,
and read, as followeth.$]
[^LETTER FROM THE EARL OF MURRAY OMITTED.^]
<P 94C1>
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Thus appeareth it, That the Duke of
(^Norfolk^) first travell'd with (^Ledington^) for stay and
compounding the matter, and afterward likewise with
the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , and at both times first moved
it of himself: so now the Earl of (^Murray^) also by
his Letters doth testify, that in Conference with
him, it came first of the Duke to move the stay
of the Contention, and to what end the Duke
did it, namely, for that he aspired to the
Marriage of the (^Scotish^) Queen, and therein made
account of her Respect to the Crown of (^England^) ;
and that without the Queen's Majesty's Assent or
Knowledge. Now shall you also see, for further
proof thereof, the Bishop of (^Rosse's^) Letter to the
(^Scotish^) Queen: For the Bishop of (^Rosse^) went from
(^York^) to (^Bolton^) , as you have before heard in this
Examination. On the way, before he came to (^Bolton^)
to the (^Scotish^) Queen, from his Lodging he wrote
a Letter to her, which Letter was lost, by his
Servant; but as good hap was, he reserv'd a Copy
thereof, and negligently left it behind him in his
Lodging at (^Newcastle^) , where the Earl of (^Murray^)
half a year after being lodg'd in the same
Chamber, found it, and sent it to the Queen's Majesty's
Council; and here it is all written with the
Bishop's own Hand, as himself, being examin'd
thereof, hath confess'd. Here he setteth out the
Conference between the Duke of (^Norfolk^) , and
(^Ledington^) , and himself. He sheweth the Duke of
(^Norfolk's^) Advice to the (^Scotish^) Queen, for a Letter
by her to be written to the Queen's Majesty; and
also he openeth the Duke's Advice, how to work
for the (^Scotish^) Queen, with disclosing the Queen's
Majesty's Secrets.
[^BISHOP OF ROSSE'S LETTER TO MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS, OMITTED.^]
<P 94C2>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Here be many things and many parts
very hard for me to remember; and here be 
produced three Witnesses against me, (^Ledington^) , the
Bishop of (^Rosse^) , and the Earl of (^Murray^) .
Hereunto I will answer, as my Memory will serve me:
(^Ledington^) , because he and I were acquainted at
(^Lyth^) , came to me and practised to search at my
hands, and to feel how the Queen's Majesty was
satisfy'd. I told him, that till I heard what the
Queen's Majesty would resolve, I could tell him
nothing: And so time spent away. And in the
mean season, upon a (^Saturday^) , I being at Dinner
with the Lord of (^Sussex^) , (^Ledington^) came in; and
after Dinner talking with me, he brake more
earnestly for me with the (^Scotish^) Queen, and for a
Marriage between her and me, which I utterly
refus'd, as by my Letters from (^York^) to the Queen's
Majesty it may appear; wherein I signify'd my
Opinion of the (^Scotish^) Queen, or else she must
be maintain'd by the Queen of (^England^) . I said
to him again, that the Queen's Majesty sought
the Quietness of that Realm: but for any Advice
of restoring the (^Scotish^) Queen into her Country,
I could not see how it might be consider'd: and
so I advis'd him to submit the whole Matter to
the Queen's Majesty's Judgment. Otherwise he
and I never talk'd. Of those other doings,
between (^Ledington^) and the (^Scotish^) Queen, I know
nothing. The Bishop of (^Rosse^) shortly after said
to me, and intreated to have my help for
compounding of the Matter, as you know well he can
speak fair. I told him I could do nothing
without my Fellows, and only in such manner as was
prescrib'd by our Commission. I told him also,
that we were but to hear and certify; and for
the Matter of compounding, they were best to
<P 95C1>
make Offers themselves; for we were but to
receive such Devices as they should chuse, and to
give Advertisement of the same. To what end
should I need to utter the Matters of the Earl of
(^Murray's^) part to the other side, when (^Ledington^)
himself was present, and privy to all? I spake
not with the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , but at that time
only. And as for that Advice, to avoid the
discovering of those rigorous Matters by the Earl,
and the publishing thereof to the Queen's Majesty,
to the (^Scotish^) Queen's infamy; I never disclos'd
any such Secrets, nor gave any such Advice:
Only I did advise the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , that he
and that side should hold themselves contented with
the Queen's Majesty's dealing, and with the
Determination taken at (^Hampton-Court^) , which was
such as might content them, and such as my Lord
(^Burleigh^) then mislik'd. As for the Earl (^Murray^) ,
he began with me, and not I with him: He came
to me at (^Cawood^) , and pray'd me to tell him what
end would come of the Matter. I said, I knew
not; for it must come from the Queen's Majesty:
We knew not of the differing of the Commission
at that time, nor till such time as Mr. (^Sadler^) was
sent for. How could I tell him, and knew it not
my self? I never yielded to the Marriage between
the (^Scotish^) Queen and me: I cannot gather such
Matter of Looks alone, and I never dealt more
therein, but only that (^Ledington^) broke it. Have
I not answer'd all these Matters? If I have not,
put me in any thing I have omitted, and I will
answer it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Your Answer is but only Denial;
(^Ledington^) and the rest write otherwise, that you made the
first Motion to them: and therefore (^Ledington^) , by
Practice between you and him, sent the Earl of
(^Murray^) to you, under pretence of searching to
learn the State of their own Cause, to be mov'd by
you for the Marriage; upon your Answer, it is
but yea and nay between you. If you meant
directly, then needed you not to have dealt so
secretly in Conference with (^Ledington^) , without the
rest of the Commissioners; and besides (^Ledington's^)
Conference with you, both the Bishop of (^Rosse^)
and the Earl (^Murray^) affirm your practising with
them to the same intent: which is sufficient Proof
against your own bare Denial.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] The Earl (^Murray^) sought my Life, the
other are not of Credit; yet all these prove not
that I dealt in the matter of the Marriage with
the (^Scotish^) Queen, in any respect of her Claim to
the Crown of (^England^) . If the Bishop of (^Rosse^) ,
or any other, can say otherwise, let them be brought
before me face to face: I have often so desir'd it,
but I could not obtain it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] The Bishop of (^Rosse^) confesseth it; this is
his own hand; and here you shall have, by
Witnesses, prov'd the Duke's Assent to the Marriage
with the (^Scotish^) Queen: and to practise the
furtherance thereof, you shall see how that afterwards
he was privy to a Device, that the Earl (^Murray^)
should have been murder'd at (^Northallerton^) , in his
way homeward, by the (^Nortons^) , (^Markenfield^) , and
other Rebels; and afterwards, being satisfy'd at
the Earl (^Murray's^) hands, a Letter was written to
stay that Device: containing also a Device of
compounding the Matter, and how the Earl
(^Murray^) had assented to the Marriage.

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 96C1>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] All these are Letters, and answer'd two
years ago, when Mr. (^Sadler^) and Mr. (^Attorney^) were
sent to examine me upon Interrogatories. Indeed
I must confess my Folly; it is an ill Cook that
cannot lick his own Fingers. The Bishop of (^Rosse^)
wrote the Letter, and he lick'd his own Fingers.
The Earl of (^Murray^) wrote to me very humbly,
and that he was at my Commandment, with such
like words. I having no leisure to write Answer
to him, drew Articles to give him thanks: but
that the Noblemen lik'd of that Marriage, and
that I wish'd no Man's Friendship more than his
<P 96C2>
in it, the Bishop of (^Rosse^) added of his own, and
put it in Cypher in this Form, which Cypher I
had not then.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] This is the very Copy of your own Letter.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] See my Answer made in my first
Troubles, two years past.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] The Queen's Majesty understanding the
Duke's Intention to marry with the (^Scotish^) Queen,
the Duke himself, by way of Prevention,
complain'd to her Majesty of the Rumour that was
spread against him, That he sought the (^Scotish^)
Queen's Marriage, and pray'd it might be
examin'd. In which her complaint, as I have heard
her Majesty her self declare it, and some here of
my Lords have likewise heard it, he said, among
other things, To what end should I seek to marry
her, being so wicked a Woman, such a notorious
Adulteress and Murderer? I love to sleep upon a
safe Pillow: I account my self, to your Majesty's
good Favour, as good a Prince at home in my
Bowling-Alley at (^Norwick^) , as she is, tho she were
in the middle of her Kingdom. The Revenues of
the Crown of (^Scotland^) (all the ordinary Charges
deducted) about the necessary Affairs of the
Realm, are not comparable to mine own that I
enjoy by your Goodness, as I have heard of the
chief Officers of that Realm; considering also
that her Kingdom is not in her hand, but
possess'd by another; if I should seek to match with
her, knowing, as I do know, that she pretendeth
a Title to the present possession of your Crown,
your Majesty might justly charge me with
seeking your own Crown from your Head. This the
Duke spake to the Queen's Majesty, in his Excuse,
when the Fame went of his Marriage with the
(^Scotish^) Queen, when yet, beside that time, he
had dealt earnestly in it.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I may not nor will not stand against her
Majesty's Testimony, I must give place unto it;
but hereof I was examin'd two years ago, and
then I declar'd, as I now do, that at that time I
intended not the Marriage. And true it is, that
I have at sundry times, some at one time, and
some at another, us'd some of those kinds of
Speeches; but at that time I dealt not with that
Marriage, nor minded it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Your own Confession is otherwise; for your
self have since confess'd that you conceal'd from
the Queen your Conferences with (^Ledington^) and
(^Rosse^) about the Marriage, both the Conferences
had at (^York^) and at (^Hampton-Court^) .
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I never consented to the Marriage at those
times of their Conferences, and so I might well
use their Speeches.

<S SAMPLE 4>
<P 98C1>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] This maketh for me; for this proveth
that I so much misliking her, and signifying by
my Letter so much against her, dealt not on that
side when I was at (^York^) , where this Letter was
written.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] There were others joind'd with you in the
Letter, so that you could not otherwise write,
however you otherwise dealt: but this maketh
much against you, for it prov'd you had an evil
Opinion of her, and so could not seek the
Marriage in respect of her Person, but only in respect
of her false Title; and that not to the Kingdom
of (^Scotland^) , which she had not, and which you
despis'd, but to the Crown of (^England^) . Now you
shall, to the same end, hear your own Report
against her to (^Bannister^) .
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Bannister^) was shrewdly cramp'd, when
he told that Tale. I beseech you, let me have him
brought Face to Face.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] No more than you were.

   [$Then was read (^Bannister's^) Confession, in (^October,
12 Eliz.^) $]
This sheweth that you had an evil Opinion
of her, and so no Affection to the Person;
<P 98C2>
therefore your seeking of that Marriage was for
another Respect; and therefore (^Ledington^) , (^Rosse^) , and
you practis'd the Matter at (^York^) .
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] They broke it to me. What is this to
me? Did I consent?
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] You consented.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] They say plainly, that you practis'd to
withdraw the things that might charge her.
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] You have said, that the Bishop of
(^Rosse^) hath accus'd you of Malice; but you
answer nothing to that which the Bishop of (^Rosse^)
wrote to his Mistress, the (^Scotish^) Queen, in
Secrecy, wherein could be no Malice.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Ledington^) broke it to me, and the Earl
(^Murray^) broke it to me. I pray you, let them be
brought face to face to me: I have oft requir'd
it, and the Law I trust is so.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] The Law was so for a time, in some
Cases of Treason: but, since, the Law hath been
found too hard and dangerous for the Prince,
and it hath been repeal'd. You intended to
have proceeded with the Marriage by Force; and
for proof thereof, you have heard of the Device
for taking of the (^Tower^) . Now to prove further
your Purpose to pursue your Enterprize by Force,
let be read the Confession of the Bishop of (^Rosse^)
to the second Article.
[^DEPOSITION OF THE BISHOP OF ROSSE OMITTED.^]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] All is false, saving that the Bishop of
(^Rosse^) once spake with me; and then
understanding him to be a suspected Man, I desir'd him
to forbear to come to me; nevertheless, by his
great Earnestness and Importunity, that I would
but once admit him to come to me, at length
he came, and then he mov'd me for certain
<P 99C1>
Money of the (^Scotish^) Queen's, about 2000 (^l.^)
remaining in my keeping: One Letter he brought
me, and no more Letters, till after my first
Trouble. As for my going into (^Norfolk^) , I can
bring good Witness, that I meant not to go into
(^Norfolk^) , four Hours before I went, and that I
spake not with him in two days before. It is of
good ground that I have prayed to have the Bishop
of (^Rosse^) brought to me in private Examination face
to face, whereby I might have put him in
remembrance of Truth; but I have not had him
face to face, nor have been suffer'd to bring
forth Witnesses, Proofs, and Arguments, as 
might have made for my Purgation. As for
sending of Letters to my Lord of (^Northumberland^) ,
or my Brother of (^Westmoreland^) , all is false; I
never receiv'd Letters from them in all my time.
If ever I sent to them, or receiv'd from them any
Letters in three Quarters of a Year before, let me
never be credited.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] You shall have Proofs that the Bishop of
(^Rosse^) hath said it. You stand much upon your
own Credit: Now therefore to your Credit, I will
say somewhat against your Oath specially taken,
when you were appointed Commissioner for the
Matter at (^York^) ; and against your Oath of a
Counsellor to the Queen's Majesty, you dealt
indirectly and partially; you deceiv'd the Queen's
Majesty's Trust, and disclos'd her Secrets.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I deny it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] It is well prov'd that at (^Hampton-Court^) ,
being examined of the Matter by the Queen's Majesty,
you dissembled it: Being examin'd of Money lent
by you to the (^Scotish^) Queen, you deny'd it: Being
charg'd upon your Allegiance, you promis'd not
to proceed further in the Matter.
Notwithstanding that express Commandment of her Majesty:
yet, against your Duty, against your Promise and
Faith, you still proceeded.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I confess this was mine Error; but I have
already made humble Petition to my Peers, not
to confound my Faults together, nor to mingle
my inferior Offences with this great Cause.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Sithence the Commandment given to you
at (^Titchfield^) , not to proceed in Dealing with
the (^Scotish^) Queen in any wise, you have
continually dealt with her: You have lent her
Money; you have maintain'd (^Liggons^) , your Man
and your Solicitor, continually to advertise you,
from the Bishop of (^Glasgow^) , and the Pope's
Nuncio; and you have advertis'd him from hence.
He hath had Money of you, and you have
receiv'd Letters from him four times in Coffers.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Liggons^) is not my Sollicitor.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] He is your Sollicitor, and so your self
have expounded him; for where the (^Scotish^)
Queen, in her Letters, speaketh of your
Sollicitor, being ask'd whom she meant thereby, you
have answer'd, (^Liggons^) .
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] At the first indeed she so called him; but
Sollicitor is no Name of use. He hath not been
so since my first Trouble; and so for her calling
it is no matter, she once called me (^Legista^) .
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] He is your Sollicitor; for she so taketh him,
and your self do so expound it.
   [$Then was read his own Confession, of Money
lent 2000 (^l.^) and receiv'd, (^&c.^)
   The Duke confess'd this Receiving and
Lending of Money.
   Then was read the Bishop of (^Rosse's^)
Confession, concerning Money sent by (^Barthwick^) , and
of Money deliver'd to (^Francis Bishop^) .$]
<P 99C2>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] This I deny not.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] (^Francis Bishop^) was a Traitor
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I knew him not.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Now for the matter of taking the (^Tower^) .
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I deny it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Was it not mention'd unto you in the
way, when you came from (^Titchfield^) , by one that
came to you, and moved you a Device between
you and another, for taking the (^Tower^) ?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I have confess'd that such a Motion was
made to me, but I never assented to it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] You concealed it: And to what end should
you have taken the (^Tower^) , but to have kept it
against the Queen by Force? But you say you
lik'd not the Motion, you ask'd advice of it.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Indeed I told one of it: (^Owen^) met me
by the way from (^Titchfield^) , and told me how we
were all in danger; and said, That some of our
Friends thought it was best to take the (^Tower^) ,
I refus'd to do it, and said, Take the (^Tower^) !
that were a proper Device indeed! And thence
I went to my Lord of (^Pembroke's^) , and there din'd;
and then I told my Lord of (^Pembroke^) of that
Device; whereunto he answer'd, We are well,
and safe enough: Let them that be faulty take
the (^Tower^) , if they will. And to what end should
I have taken the (^Tower^) ?
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] To maintain by Force that which you
had practis'd against the Queen's Majesty's
Commandment, which was the Marriage with the
(^Scotish^) Queen.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I had not then dealt with it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] It is well prov'd that you had; and
afterward, at your House at (^Charter-house^) , you receiv'd
Letters, Messages, and Tokens from the (^Scotish^)
Queen; you receiv'd from her a Brooch, with a
Hand cutting down a Vine, and this Posy upon it,
(^ (\Virescit vulnere Virtus\) ^) . But my Lord, do green
Vines grow when they be cut? and a green Vine
it was.
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] My Lord, you still say you dealt not
at this time, or that time, against her Majesty's
Commandment; I pray you at what time, since
her Majesty's Commandment upon your
Allegiance, did you forbear to deal with the (^Scotish^)
Queen?
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Beside this, you have given Advice as a
Counsellor to the (^Scotish^) Queen, against the Queen's
Majesty: namely, when in Treaty between the
Queen's Majesty and her, there were three
Articles propounded on the Queen's Majesty part;
the one for the Delivery of her Son into the
Queen's Majesty's Custody; the other for
delivering the (^English^) Rebels that were fled into (^Scotland^) ;
the third for delivering of certain Holds in
(^Scotland^) into (^English^) Mens Possession: He gave Advice
herein as a Counsellor, against the Queen his
Sovereign Lady. The Articles were expresly sent
to the Duke to have his Advice, before that the
(^Scotish^) Queen would resolve of any Answer; and
she respited her Answer to be made according to
his Direction. He gave Advice, that she should
in no wise deliver her Son, for it was against her
own Safety, not knowing whether she deliver'd
him into her Friends hands or no. As for the
Rebels, she should in no wise deliver them, for it
were against her Honour: And as for the Holds,
she should not deliver any; for it were against the
Safety of her Friends in (^Scotland^) .
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] For advising not to deliver the Rebels, I
deny that ever I gave any such Advice. As for
Delivery of her Son, I advis'd her no otherwise
<P 100C1>
but thus, that I wish'd her to bestow him there,
where she might have sure Friends.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Thus, contrary to your Oath, Allegiance,
and Fidelity, and against the Credit that you would
fain be thought of, you became, by your own
Confession, a Counsellor to a foreign Prince
against your own Sovereign Lady.
   [$ (^Burleigh.^) $] My Lord, did you ever desire to have
any Proofs or Witnesses produc'd for your part, to
prove any thing that might make for you? And
were you deny'd?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I have divers times pray'd, that if any
thing were deny'd to be true which I said, I might
be driven to my Proof of it.
   [$ (^Burleigh.^) $] I ask it, because I have not heard it
reported to her Majesty that you made any such
Request, to have any special Witnesses examin'd,
or Proofs heard, on your part.
   [$Here was produc'd and read the Confession of
(^Hickford^) to the 3rd Article.$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I advis'd her, touching her Son, that she
should first be well assur'd that he should be
bestow'd among her Friends. For her Castles, I
advis'd her, that she should in any wise take heed,
that they might not after come into the hands of
her Enemies; for so if she deliver'd
(^Edinburgh-Castle^) , she should not be safe in (^Holyrood-House^) .
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] How standeth this with the Duty and
Oath of a Counsellor, to give Advice to a
foreign Prince against the Queen's Majesty?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I excuse it not, herein I confess my
Error; I beseech you call not these my inferiour
Faults, which I have confess'd, among the greater
wherewith I am charg'd.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Thus appeareth how he hath given Advice
against the Queen to the (^Scotish^) Queen. Now it
shall be further prov'd unto you, that where the
(^Scotish^) Queen is here in Custody as the Queen's
Prisoner, he hath also been privy to Devices for
conveying her away.
   [$Here was produc'd the Confession of (^Barker^) ,
(^October^) 5. 1571. Article 13.$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] This is not true, saving that indeed
Advice was broken to me of conveying her away at a
Window, at a Gallery's-end, in one of my Lord of
(^Shrewsbury's^) Houses, of the which Window the
Bishop of (^Rosse^) had taken a measure; but this
Device was overthrown at such time as it was told me.
As for that which (^Barker^) hath here confess'd, it is
utterly false.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Now shall you hear the Duke's own
Confession.

   [$Here was read the Duke's Examination, 13
(^Octobris^) .$]
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Besides this, the Duke being in Prison in
the (^Tower^) , made a Submission to the Queen's
Majesty, confess'd his Error in dealing with the
(^Scotish^) Queen, and promis'd, upon his Faith and
Allegiance, never to deal with that Marriage, nor
with any other Matter touching the (^Scotish^) Queen.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I confess I did so.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Before his subscribing his said Submission,
he first made the (^Scotish^) Queen privy to it, and
sent her a Double of it.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I sent it to the Bishop of (^Rosse^) .
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] All is one.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I confess it.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] What should move my Lord of (^Norfolk^)
now so earnestly still to pursue this Marriage?
<P 100C2>
You see he lik'd not the Person, she was not of
good Fame, he so signify'd to the Queen, he so
reported to (^Bannister^) . The Kingdom of (^Scotland^) he
esteem'd not, and also it was out of her possession,
in the hands of the King her Son, by her own
Dimission ratify'd by Parliament. Forsooth he had an old
blind Prophecy lying by him: (^ (\In exaltatione Luna
Leo succumbet, & Leo cum Leone conjungetur, &
catuli eorum regnabunt\) ^) ; which belike is thus to be
expounded, (^At the Exaltation of the Moon^) (which was
the Rising of the Earl of (^Northumberland^) , that 
giveth the Moon) the (^Lion^) (which is the Queen's
Majesty) (^shall be overthrown; then shall the Lion be
join'd with a Lion^) (which is the Duke of (^Norfolk^)
with the (^Scotish^) Queen, for they both bear Lions in
their Arms) (^and their Whelps shall reign^) , (that is,
their Posterity shall have the Kingdom.) 
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I do not remember any such Prophecy.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] It was in your own keeping.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] What should I do with it?
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Such blind Prophecies have oft deceiv'd
Noblemen.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] This is nothing to the purpose; I kept it
not to any such end.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] You utter'd it to your Servant (^Hickford^) .

   [$Here was produc'd and read (^Hickford's^) Testimony.$]

   [$ (^Duke.^) $] A Toy! You see I call it a foolish Prophecy.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Where had you it?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I remember it not.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Hitherto have you heard the Evidence to 
prove the Duke's Imagination, Compassing, and
Conspiracy, to deprive the Queen's Majesty of
the Crown and her Royal Estate, and so to bring
her Highness to Death and Destruction. For
proving this his Intent, you have heard those Matters
prov'd, his Practice to join himself in Marriage
with the (^Scotish^) Queen, whom he then well knew
falsly to claim and pretend Title to the present
possession of the Crown of (^England^) : also his
prosecuting the same Marriage without the Queen's
Majesty's Knowledge, against her Highness's
express Commandment upon his Allegiance, against
his Faith, Promise, and Submission; yea, and to
pursue that with force, and to use the Advice and
Strength of his Friends, to maintain the same force
against the Queen; his hearkening to blind
Prophecies, Mony by him lent to the (^Scotish^) Queen, and
against the Queen his Sovereign Lady. If then his
Purpose so were to pursue it with force, it must
needs follow, that the same must be of Intent,
Imagination, and Compassing, to deprive and
depose the Queen's Majesty from her Crown, Royal
Estate, and Dignity, and to advance and maintain
that false and usurp'd Title of the (^Scotish^) Queen unto
the present possession of the Crown of (^England^) , and
so consequently, for maintenance of his
Imagination and Purpose, to compass the Queen's Majesty's
Death and Destruction. Now shall you further
hear Proof of his own words, declaring the same
intent to pursue the Marriage by force, and rather
to lose his Life than to give it over.
[^DEPOSITION OF CAVENDISH OMITTED.^]
<P 101C1>
   [$ (^Duke.^) The Duke looking upon (^Cavendish^) with a 
scornful and smiling Countenance, said,$] (^You are an
honest Man^) ! That which he saith of the Talk
between him and me at (^Southampton^) , is utterly false:
At that time you were most earnest on my part,
and came to me as for Succour, for that as you
said your Cousin (^Christmas^) was fallen out with you.
When we rode to my Lord of (^Pembroke's^) , you
came to me and told me, my Lord (^Burleigh^) findeth
me well, I will ride with him and find his
Humour, and I will face that Fellow thorowly; so
from (^Salisbury^) you said you would ride to (^Leicester^) ,
so and home with my Lord (^Burleigh^) , and you
doubted not to bring me such word from him as
should satisfy me. You told me how my Lord of
(^Leicester^) was firm, and Sir (^Nicholas Throckmorton^) my
sure Friend, and that they would both join to deal
with the Queen for me; and how Sir (^Nicholas 
Throckmorton^) sent me word, That he doubted not
the Queen would take order to my Contentation
at her next Coming to a staid House. Then came
you to (^London^) , and tho I had no great Liking of
you, yet because you were loth to lie at (^Arundels's^) ,
and were somewhat ill at Ease, I let you lie in my
House. I never made great account of you; my
Lord of (^Leicester^) made us first acquainted, your
Brother you know was not my Friend, I then
took you as I now find you. While you could
hold on, you shew'd your Letters that you did
write on my behalf; then you came to me and
said, you had need, and borrow'd Mony of me;
I had none at that time, but I sent it you by (^Bowes^) .
I was warn'd by divers of my Friends to take
heed of you; you dealt with (^Dier^) and with (^Straunge^)
very maliciously. As for the Speech at 
(^Remming-Hall^) , that you speak of me, it is untrue; I dealt
not with you there about any such matter; I left
you at (^London^) , I look'd not for you; when you
came, I was glad to be rid of you; you said you
were going to (^Norwich^) , and I was glad you were
going, and will'd you to look at my House at
(^Norwich^) and tell me how you liked it: Out of the
(^North^) I heard nothing in six Weeks before. You
suddenly slipp'd away from me, and then came I
up to (^London^) ward; you are an honest Man
indeed, it is all false that he hath said.
<P 101C2>
   [$Then (^Cavendish^) began to report and justify
what he had said, and to put the Duke in
remembrance, when the Duke gave him reproachful
words of Discredit.$]
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] He is sworn, there needeth no more 
proving; you sent (^Havers^) to the Earl of (^Westmoreland^) .
   [$Then was alledg'd the Examination of one
(^Haveling^) touching (^Havers^) , whom the Duke sent to the
Earl of (^Northumberland^) , with this Message, (^That if
the two Earls should rise, he were undone^) .$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] This may be seen of two years old, and
by me fully declar'd and answer'd.

   [$Then was read the Confession of (^Havers^) .$]

   [$Then was alledg'd a Letter of the (^Scotish^)
Queen's in Cypher to the Duke, containing, that
the Lord of (^Shrewsbury^) had told her, that the Earl
of (^Northumberland^) was deliver'd to the Earl of
(^Sussex^) ; for which she was very sorrowful three
days together, for fear of cumbring of Friends if
he were taken.$]
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] What Friends was she so careful for, that
she wrote to the Duke, unless she thought it should
light upon the Duke himself?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] That Letter never came to my hands.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] It was found in the Bag which you will'd
to be burn'd.

   [$Then the said Letter was read.$]

   [$ (^Duke.^) $] All this is nothing to me.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] This proveth in you a Practice to the
Rebellion; for all her Sorrow of the yielding of the
Earl of (^Northumberland^) was, for fear he should
bewray and cumber her Friends.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] That toucheth not me; for I am sure the
Earl of (^Northumberland^) hath been sought for me,
and yet he cannot accuse me.
   [$ (^Serj.^) $] Had it not concern'd you, it had not been
written to you.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Some Letters never came to my hands:
sometime they came to the Bishop of (^Rosse^) ,
sometime to (^Bannister^) , sometime not all decipher'd; as
(^Straunge^) and (^Bowes^) , and other that have been
Messengers for me, can tell.

<S SAMPLE 5>
<P 104C2>  
   [$Here was read the Letter of the (^Scotish^) Queen
to the Bishop of (^Rosse^) .$]
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] By this Letter appeareth, how the
(^Scotish^) Queen hath set out the whole Plot of
the Treason: A Message should be sent for Aid
from foreign parts; (^Rodolph^) the fittest Man to be
the Messenger; and that (^Rodolph^) should be
dispatch'd to go about it, when the Duke of
(^Norfolk^) would. The Device was to move King
(^Philip^) for Aid, upon a Consideration of her State
here, to enter into Deliberation of the Time and
Opportunities to set her Friends to Field, and to
seize themselves of her. This is confess'd by
(^Hickford^) ; and this Letter is also confess'd by the Duke
himself, that he receiv'd it about (^January^) was
Twelve-month, and it was hid under the Matts.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I bid that the Letter should be burnt.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] God would not have it so; but that
it should remain for disclosing the Matter.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] As touching (^Rodolph^) , what manner of
Man he was, is no matter to me: I know of no
more, nor am to be charg'd with no more than
I my self am privy to. I never dealt with him
about any Cause of mine. I receiv'd no such
Letter, but that which (^Barker^) said came from him,
which was not that (^January^) that you speak of,
about two Years ago; and as for Instructions and
Letters about that (^January^) was Twelve-month,
I receiv'd none.
   [$ (^Burleigh.^) Here the Lord (^Burleigh^) said to Mr.
Attorney,$] You may mistake, it was this time 
<P 105C1>
Twelve-Month, for now we are in (^January^) . [$And so Mr.
Attorney remembring this present Month to be
(^January^) , referr'd the Letter to (^January^) now a Year
past; and said,$] This Letter that I now charg'd
you with, came to your hands at this (^January^)
was Twelve-month: It came first to the (^Scotish^)
Queen's hand; she took occasion upon
considering her own Case here in (^England^) , in (^France^) , and
in her own Country, that it was best for her to
cleave unto (^Spain^) . She wrote to the Bishop of
(^Rosse^) her Discourse to that end: She counted
(^Rodolph^) the fittest Messenger; Matter was devis'd
for his Instructions; she referr'd the Dispatch
wholly to the Duke of (^Norfolk^) : the Duke dealt
in it, his Message appeareth. And thus it
continued till (^March^) ; and then, according to the Plot
before laid, (^Rodolph^) was dispatch'd, and went over
indeed.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] What was deliver'd to (^Barker^) , I know
not; that is nothing to me: I am sure they will
not say they deliver'd it me, nor that I receiv'd
any such Letters or Instructions. Thus I say, the
Bishop sent me a Letter of the (^Scotish^) Queen's,
together with a Letter of his own: In her
Letter she complaineth of her own Subjects, and
saith, she will seek other Means for her Relief.
This Letter was decypher'd; I mislik'd the
Device, and bad that the Letter should be burn'd;
so the Letter in Cypher was burn'd, and the
Alphabet was sav'd. I sent word that I mislik'd all
those Devices, and I advis'd the (^Scotish^) Queen to
depend only upon the Queen's Majesty, or else,
if she would take any other Cause, both I, and
all other her Friends in (^England^) , would give her
over; and hereupon it was that I said, that the
Queen, if she fell to such Practices, would
publish her Letters and Doings to her Infamy. Upon
which my Words, the Bishop of (^Rosse^) excus'd
himself, and laid all this Matter, of this new Device,
to (^Beyton^) and (^Rewley^) . It is not true that (^Barker^)
made me privy to any such Message or
Instructions, as hath been alledg'd. Also he is not to be
allow'd for a Witness against me, for he hath
confess'd Treason against himself; and Persons
outlaw'd, or attained of Treason, are not sufficient
Witnesses.
   [$ (^Catlin.^) $] My Lord, there is none of those
Witnesses, that have declar'd Matter against you, outlaw'd,
or attained of Treason, or yet indicted.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] They are worse; for they have confess'd
Treason.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] The Bishop of (^Rosse^) , at this time, was
in Custody, and these Men also that have
confess'd against you, were also kept in Custody, kept
asunder in several Places, and severally examin'd,
agreed all in one, and your own Confessions agree
with them: How can this be imagin'd and false?
All these do testify it with one Consent. The
Bishop of (^Rosse^) , when he first came to the City,
was examin'd of these things, he deny'd all, he
stood in it earnestly; when Questions were asked
him, he said, He was an Embassador, and not so
to be dealt with, but to be referr'd to his own
Mistress the (^Scotish^) Queen. When he was
committed to the (^Tower^) , and there again examin'd,
seeing things confess'd already; and by the
manner of the Questions that were ask'd, perceiving
some Light that the Truth was known; then he
confessed also, and in his Confessions doth agree
fully with (^Barker^) and the rest: which Consent
could not possibly be, if the Matter were not true;
besides that, he hath in his Confession touch'd
himself.
<P 105C2>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] They have not agreed in Confession
against me, that I told them any such thing; but
one of them told another, and so from hand to
hand it went among them.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] Well you see what is confess'd, and
with what Consent we are at Issue; here is but
your Lordship's Denial; I leave it to my Lords
here to consider of the Proofs. If you had been
a good Subject, being then a Prisoner in your own
House, when such dangerous Matter came to
your Understanding, you would have open'd it,
that the Queen's Majesty and her Council might
have provided to withstand them, but you did it
not. The Duke of (^Norfolk^) found flat Treason in
intended; (^Rodolph^) was the Messenger that
procured it; the Duke knew it; (^Rodolph^) was referr'd
to the Duke's Dispatch, upon the Conference of 
the Bishop of (^Rosse^) and (^Rodolph^) about the Matter,
and the (^Scotish^) Queen's Willingness to have him
sent about the Matter. Thus it proceeded: It was
agreed that (^Rodolph^) should have his Message in
Writing; and at the same Conference, (^Barker^)
being also among them, it was agreed, and set
down in his Instructions, that his Message should 
be this: He should go to the Pope and the King 
of (^Spain^) , in the Name of the (^Scotish^) Queen and of
the Duke of (^Norfolk^) , to require of them Money
and Men for the Enterprize. (^Rodolph^) requir'd to
speak with the Duke: (^Barker^) brought him to the
Duke at (^Howard-House^) ; there they talk'd together,
the Duke and (^Rodolph^) a whole Hour, till it was
nine of the Clock at Night. After this Talk,
the Duke deliver'd to (^Barker^) a Paper, saying,
that (^Rodolph^) left it with him; which Paper
contain'd the Sum of the Treason, and therein was
also a Paper of the Names of divers Noblemen,
Knights, and Gentlemen in Cypher, whom they
counted that they would take the Duke's part,
but they counted without their Host; so that
there was for every Name a Cypher, of the which
40 was for the Duke, and 30 for the Lord (^Lumley^) .
(^Barker^) receiv'd it of the Duke, and deliver'd it
again to (^Rodolph^) . Upon this Cypher of 40, fell
out the understanding of the Treason.

   [$Here was read (^Barker's^) Deposition, 10 (^October^) ,
Interr. 8.
   (^Item^) , (^Barker^) to the 22 Interr.$]

   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] In this Bill the Duke is proved to be
40, the Duke himself hath also confess'd that 40
standeth for his own Name. (^Barker^) brought
(^Rodolph^) to the Duke, which the Duke also
confess'd, and that (^Barker^) brought him Instructions
for (^Rodolph's^) Money.
   [$Here Mr. Treasurer and Mr. Chancellor of the
Exchequer, sworn, did testify that (^Barker^) made all
these Confessions freely, without Compulsion.
   Also Mr. (^Wilson^) , sworn, did testify the same;
and that (^Barker^) was never offer'd Torture, nor
was once in the Prison where the Rack was: but
the Duke said (^Barker^) saw where his Fellow had
been.$]
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] Did not (^Barker^) bring (^Rodolph^) to you
at nine of the Clock at Night? Did he not leave
with you Instructions in (^French^) ?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I confess it.

   [$Then was read (^Barker^) to the 16th.$]

   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] (^Rodolph^) came also the second time
to the Duke; after he was come from the Duke,
he said to (^Barker^) , That the Duke and he were
<P 106C1>
agreed of his Journey, and that the Duke pray'd
him to depart with speed.
   This Message was to procure Men and Money
for the Enterprize of the Treason; and on this
Message the Duke dispatch'd him.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Touching (^Rodolph's^) coming, I have
indeed confess'd that he came to me. I was in
Summer was Twelve-Month bound in
Recognizance for 1800 (^l.^) to (^Rodolph^) , for my Lord of
(^Arundel^) , and my Brother (^Lumley^) ; the Day was
pass'd whereby I stood in danger of my
Recognizance. I sent to (^Rodolph^) to intreat him to
cancel my Recognizance, and I offer'd to give him
twenty Yards of Velvet; (^Rodolph^) would not be 
persuaded, but desired to speak with me 
himself, which (^Barker^) reported to me. I was very
loth that he should come to me, for he was in
Trouble at my last Trouble, and so I thought his
coming to me would be suspicious. (^Barker^)
promis'd that he would bring him to me secretly, and
at such a time as it should not be known to make
any Suspicion. So (^Rodolph^) came to me, and I did
what I could to intreat him about my
Recognizance, and I could not persuade him more, than
to promise that he would not sue me. He told
me of his Trouble and of his Imprisonment at
Mr. (^Walsingham's^) , and what Words Mr.
(^Walsingham^) gave unto him, also of the (^Scotish^) Queen; and
that he should deal with the Duke of (^Alva^) for
Money for her to her own Use, and for
Necessaries, as he had done before. He pray'd also
my Letters in the (^Scotish^) Queen's Favour to the
Duke of (^Alva^) : I began to mislike him, and was
loth to write; I sought ways to shift me from
him; I said I was not well at ease; I could not
write, and it was late, and so I would not deal.
As for the Bill of Names, I saw none such, nor
understood of any such, till the Letter that came
over from (^Rodolph^) about (^Easter^) . I deliver'd a
Writing to (^Barker^) : I confess it; but it was about
that Matter which I have confess'd already for my
Recognizance; and so I dealt not with any such
Matter as is alledg'd against me, nor receiv'd any
other Instructions, but only as I have said, about
my own Matters.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] My Lord, this is but your own saying,
and it carrieth no Likelihood. But (^Barker^) goeth
nearer to you; he telleth you plainly what the
Instructions were: It was to King (^Philip^) for Men,
and to the Pope for Money.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Barker^) hath confess'd himself a Traitor,
and therefore is no sufficient Witness against me.
I never knew of any such Bill of Names, nor such
Instruction in (^French^) .
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] It is sufficiently prov'd. Now (^Rodolph^)
came to you again the second time.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I deny it: He came no more to me.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] That is not so: for (^Barker^) telleth
plainly, not only the Time, but also the several Ways
by which he himself brought (^Rodolph^) to you.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] There be Ways enough, he might have
devis'd also a dozen Ways more, if he would, in
that House.

   [$Here was read (^Barker^) ad 11.$]

   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] Lo! he telleth you which way (^Rodolph^)
came to you.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] So he may devise more Ways when he
will.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] Now you shall also hear it confess'd by
the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , who at the time of his
Confession was in Prison, not knowing what (^Barker^) had
said.

<S SAMPLE 6>
<P 107C2>
[^END OF LONG SPEECH BY NORFOLK ARGUING THAT THE TESTIMONY OF 
ROSSE AND BARKER IS FALSE HAS BEEN OMITTED.^]
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] Your Answer is nothing but bare
Denial; and here are three Witnesses against you, and
all three severally examin'd, have agreed in one;
and (^Barker^) hath directly confessed; and if you
doubt of Impulsion, you shall hear how willingly
and how freely he confess'd it, because the same
Examination was taken before Sir (^Thomas Smith^) ,
and subscrib'd with his Hand: Mr. (^Wilson^) upon
his Oath declar'd the same to be Sir (^Thomas Smith's^)
Hand.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Where it is said, that I should bid them
to write, or should affirm their Writing, it is not
true. Indeed (^Bannister^) spake to me to write for
Money for the (^Scotish^) Queen, and I refused to do
it. If I should have dealt in any such matter, I
would have trusted one (^Bannister^) afore fifteen
(^Barkers^) . And as for your number of Witnesses in
this manner by Hands one from another, twenty
Witnesses may prove but one Witness.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] You shall hear your own Confession
agreeing with them; you were content (^Rodolph^)
should use your Name to the Duke of (^Alva^) , and
that he should assure the Duke you were a
Catholick, and that he should shew Tokens to prove it,
for that you kept Papists in your House, and were
a Friend to Papists.

   [$Here was read the Duke's Confession, 10 
(^October, ad interr.^) 58.$]
   Here his own Hand confesseth the Matter.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I saw the Instructions indeed, and this
Matter was in it. They sought to have it thought
I was a Catholick, to serve their Purpose, and did
put it in of themselves; but I allowed it not, I
would rather be torn with wild Horses, than
forsake my Religion.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] These Instructions remained still in
your custody: Why did you not burn these, as well
as you say that you commanded the Letter to be
burned?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Because it was their writing, and not
mine.
   [$ (^Wilb.^) $] You are content it should be extant; to
what purpose was that, if you misliked it?
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] Your Lordship shall yet see further
a Letter of the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , written to the
(^Scotish^) Queen, wherein the whole Plot and Course
of the Treason is plainly set out at large; the
Letter came to the (^Scotish^) Queen's hands while
my Lord Steward was there, which my Lord
Steward affirmed. [$So the Letter was read.$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] The Bishop of (^Rosse^) is no sufficient
Witness against me, for the Causes that I have
declared.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] I leave his Credit to my Lords here
to consider, let them weigh it as they see cause.
Now come to consider your own Doings: since
<P 108C1>
your last Imprisonment, Letters have been
conveyed unto you, and you have sent Letters
abroad, by many subtle and secret Ways of
Conveyance. One Letter you sent out, written with
Red-Ocre, wherein plainly appeareth that you
feared the Matter, and that something was
confessed, and that you were afraid of more; you
willed the Bishop of (^Rosse^) should take all upon
him, because he was an Embassador, and that a
Bag of Writings should be sought out and burned.

   [$Here the Letter written in Red-Ocre was read,
which the Duke confessed to be his own.$]
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] This Letter gave occasion to seek the
Bag, and so were the Writings found under Boards
fast nailed, and thereby was understood that
(^Quarante^) was the Duke; and so by God's Work broke
out the whole Practice of the Treason. This
Letter was directed to no body.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] It was written to (^Bayly^) , and (^Bayly^)
received it. I can answer this Letter well enough.
Here I am charged with two Matters, for matter
of my Confessions, and for burning the Bags of
Letters. As for that which is there said, that I
confessed nothing but what I saw confessed by
others, the truth is, I received a Letter, wherein
I was charged, that I had accused some falsly. I
wrote to satisfy, that I had not accused any of any
matter of Treason, nor could if I would; and this
was the meaning of that Part of my Letter.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] Where is the Letter whereby you were
charged that you had accused falsly?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I kept it not; think you I would keep
Letters? Burned Letters do not hurt. As for
burning the Writings in the Bag, it maketh
nothing against me in this Case; for they were
nothing but private Letters of the (^Scotish^) Queen's,
written before, and when I was last in Trouble,
long before this Matter. At (^Bannister's^) coming
up at (^Easter^) last, he brought them to me, and I
willed (^Barker^) to lay them up: What needeth such
searching for elder Matters? I bad them be made
away, for they were but private Matters between
the (^Scotish^) Queen and me.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] There was the Letter that disclosed
you to be (^Quarante^) , whereby the Treason was
known: now here is also another Letter of your
own, which you secretly sent out of the (^Tower^) ,
which sheweth your Guiltiness in the matter of
the great Treason with (^Rodolph^) .

   [$Here the Duke's other Letter was read.$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] This was only, as I have declared before,
for my Conference with (^Rodolph^) , for the matter of
Money, both touching mine own Recognizance,
and procuring of Money for the (^Scotish^) Queen, for
her Necessity.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] By the whole course of the Matter
that goeth before, it is for the Treason, and not
for the Money.
   Here is also another Letter of your own, which
carrieth manifest Presumptions of the Treason,
where, among other things, you will (^Barker^) to
confess no further, if he love his Life; besides other
most manifest suspicious Matters.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I wrote it not in respect of any fear that
(^Barker^) could hurt me, when I willed that (^Barker^)
should confess no more, as he loved his Life: For
indeed he might touch himself in Treason, (as he
hath done) but not me, for I never consented to it.
   [$ (^Attorney.^) $] Now shall you see how the Matter
proceeded further: After the dispatch of (^Rodolph^) ,
<P 108C2>
in (^Lent^) last, as he had made shew before, that he
intended to go over Sea, and was all this while
practising about this Treason; at length being
frighted with these Messages, he came to sue to
the Queen's Majesty for a Pass-port, which was
granted him, and he carried over two Geldings
with him, which is evident Proof that he went
over. Now shall you see what effect it took, and
by the Answer you shall discern the Message and
Practice: Being beyond the Sea, and having done
his Message, he sent advertisement to the Duke
how he sped, and likewise from the Pope; which
plainly discloseth the whole Purpose and Plot of the
Treason, as shall be declared unto your Lordships.

   [$Here began Mr. Sollicitor.$]
[^SOLICITOR'S LONG SPEECH, AND REFERENCE TO BAYLY'S LETTER 
AND CONFESSION OMITTED.^]
<P 109C2>
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] Now you see to what End the Effect of
the Message tended; you see what it was, and how
it was done; you see how it was receiv'd, and the
Duke of (^Alva's^) Questions upon it: now you shall
see the Contents of the Answer, by the Examinations
of the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , and (^Barker^) ; the receipt of the
Letters of Answer the Duke himself hath confessed.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Where they say this Message was sent by
my Privity, by reason that I was meant by 40, I
deny it; I never wrote by (^Rodolph^) , I refus'd to do
it, I knew not his Letters were to me, but as
(^Barker^) said: And it was not likely they should be
to me; for it was a Matter which I was not
privy of, and in a Cypher which I had not; (^Rodolph^)
left no Cypher with me. As for the taking of
the Pacquet, I knew nothing of it; the Letter I
never saw in Cypher; (^Barker^) brought me a Decypher,
telling me, That 40 was for me, and 30 for the
Queen of (^Scots^) . When he told me first he had the
Cypher, I ask'd what I should do with it, and how
I should read it, having no Cypher? (^Barker^)
answered, that it was left with (^Gutbert^) ; for (^Rodolph^) ,
at his departure, had told him, That he would
write answer of the Money for the (^Scotish^) Queen,
and that he would leave the Cypher with (^Gutbert^) ;
and that he had so done, and in the Letters
decyphered did appear, that the Duke of (^Alva^) had
promised aid of Money for the (^Scotish^) Queen for
her Necessities; but he could not yet do it for
want of Commission, but as soon as he had
Commission he would. When I heard of this, I
mislik'd this dealing with the Duke of (^Alva^) , having
before refus'd to write to him in the Matter at
(^Rodolph's^) Request; and I threatned (^Barker^) if he
so dealt any more with me. The Letters might
be to me, as (^Barker^) said; but I knew not so much.
<P 110C1>
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] This your Answer is in all no more than
a bare denying, and so be all your Speeches, all
upon your own Credit only.

   [$Here was read (^Barker's^) Confession, ad 2. & 3.
concerning (^Rodolph's^) Letters in Cypher, and the
Decyphering by (^Gutbert^) , and the Port where the
(^Walloons^) should have landed, (^&c.^)
   Then was read the Bishop of (^Rosse's^) to the 12
and 13, to the same effect.

   Then Mr. Sollicitor recited again the Effect of
the Letters, and the said Confessions of (^Rosse^) and
(^Barker^) , and proceeded further thus:$]
   You see all these agree in one concerning the
Contents of the Letter; now the Letter being
decyphered by (^Gutbert^) , and (^Gutbert^) being able to
discover the whole, this (^Gutbert^) , when he was sent
for by the Council, was convey'd away by the
Duke's means, as the Duke himself hath confessed.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] It may be that (^Barker^) received this Letter
as you spake of, and that (^Gutbert^) decyphered it,
and that it contain'd the Matters that you alledge;
it may be that they kept that Letter still to
themselves, and might bring me another Letter,
containing only such Matter as I was contented with,
containing the private Cause.
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] An unlikely matter; but thus you see the
Duke confesseth the receipt of the Letter, he only
denieth that it was to this effect. It was confessed,
that a Letter to this effect was written to 40; he
also confesseth, that 40 was for the Duke himself.
   The Duke of (^Alva's^) Questions prov'd the form
of the matter; the Duke read that Letter.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I read not that Letter, but of another
Matter, and you bring but one Witness to prove it.
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] There be two Witnesses, (^Barker^) and the
Bishop of (^Rosse^) , severally examined, who agreed
directly, expressing it. And (^Bayly^) also wrote the
Letter himself containing the Treason, and not
knowing to whom the Letter was directed,
accordeth with them.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Barker^) and (^Gutbert^) might make the Letter
themselves, and put in and out what they list.
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] Why did (^Rodolph^) write you any Letter at
all?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I know not. (^Barker^) presented me the
Letters out of Cypher, and I had not the Cypher,
nor saw any such Letter as you alledge.
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] It appeareth further, how after this
dispatch with the Duke of (^Alva^) , (^Rodolph^) went
forward on his Message to the Pope; and having also
good Success there, he so advertis'd again. The
Pope sent Letters to the Duke and the (^Scotish^)
Queen, to this effect, That he liked well of their
Enterprize, (^&c.^)
   Would (^Rodolph^) have gone to the Pope and
procur'd Letters, if he had not had Instructions
accordingly? The Duke himself hath confessed such
a Letter, conceived there came two Letters, both
of one Tenour; the one by the way of (^France^) , the
other by the way of (^Flanders^) : the effect you have
heard, and the receipt is confessed.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Barker^) indeed brought me about six or
seven Lines, written in a Roman Hand in (^Latin^) ,
beginning thus, (\Dilecte fili salutem\) . I asked what
it was? And (^Barker^) told me, it was a Letter from
the Pope to me: Wherewith I was offended, and
said, A Letter to me from the Pope! What
have I to do with him, that is Enemy to my
Religion and Country? How cometh this to pass? So
I received it, and not otherwise: and (^Barker^)
excus'd it, and said, That (^Rodolph^) had procur'd it for
his own Credit.
<P 110C2>
   [$Here was read (^Barker^) , ad 29.$]
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] Thus you see the Effect of this Letter,
and how this was directed to the Duke from
(^Rodolph^) , also by the name of 40, decyphered by
(^Gutbert^) , and delivered to the Duke by (^Barker^) . The
Duke received it and read it, and said, (^Rodolph^) hath
been at (^Rome^) , I perceive there will nothing be
done this year. By this appeareth, that he
reproved not (^Barker^) at all for bringing it unto him,
for (^Barker^) brought it him twice: Would he have
brought it him the second time, if the Duke had
been angry with him for it at the first?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I knew not at the first time what it was,
for it was in Cypher.

   [$Then was read (^Barker's^) Confession to the 8th.$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Barker^) is not of Credit, he accuseth me
falsly.
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] He was your Servant, and of near Place
and Credit about you; why should he accuse you
wrongfully?
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] He was not of Credit about me; for I
us'd him not this fourteen years.
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] This is not so, as hath well appeared.
Besides this, the conveying away of (^Gutbert^) ,
which was done by your means, and who
decyphered this Letter, and could have disclosed the
Matter, proveth a great Guiltiness in you.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] He was convey'd away at his own request
made, and not for my Safety.
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] You caused him to be convey'd away, and
were privy to his conveying.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] (^Barker^) removed him; indeed I was not
privy.
   [$ (^Sollic.^) $] You moved (^Bowes^) to join with (^Barker^) to
do it.
   [$Then Mr. Sollicitor said further to the Peers,$]
I have also, my Lords, one thing more to say to
you from the Queen's Majesty's own Mouth: The
Lords that be here of the Privy Council do know
it very well, not meet here in open Presence to
be uttered, because it toucheth others that are not
here now to be named; but by her Highness's 
Order, we pray that their Lordships will impart
it unto you more particularly. In (^Flanders^) , by the
Embassador of a foreign Prince, there the whole
Plot of this Treason was discovered, and by a
Servant of his brought to her Majesty's Intelligence;
the Minister not meaning to conceal so foul and
dishonourable a Practice, gave Intelligence hither
by Letters, and hath therein disclosed the whole
Treason in such Form as hath here been proved
unto you: Wherefore I refer the more particular
Declaration thereof to the Peers of the 
Privy-Council.
   [$Then began Mr. (^Wilbraham^) , Attorney of the 
Wards, and said to this effect.$]
[^LONG SPEECH OF WILBRAHAM, RECOUNTING ALL THE 
EVIDENCE AGAINST THE DUKE, OMITTED.^]
<P 113C2>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I shall hardly come, after so smooth a Tale
as Mr. Attorney of the Wards can tell; yet one
good Proof I have to my Comfort, that they be as
please your Lordships to weigh them. If you
would not have dealt thus untruly with me, I
would not have taken exception against them,
tho I chiefly challenge none but (^Barker^) , in whom
you may see what Fear may do; besides that
they have confessed themselves Traitors, and so
Men of no Conscience or Credit. It is well known
that (^Barker's^) Stomach is nothing; he hath been
known well enough; Fear hath done much in him.
The Bishop of (^Rosse^) is also a fearful Man. As
touching (^Barker^) and the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , (^Bracton^)
hath a Saying, That Witnesses must be Freemen
and not Traitors, neither outlawed nor attainted.
   [$ (^Catlin.^) $] None of them be outlaw'd, attainted, or
indicted.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I mean not that they were indicted, but
they be in as ill Case, for they have confessed
themselves Traitors. He saith also, they must be
(^Legales^) , lawful Men, and so cannot Strangers be,
as the Bishop of (^Rosse^) and (^Rodolph^) ; it is these
Strangers that charge me only, the other having dealt
so disloyally, and confessed it against themselves,
are not to be believ'd. As for (^Barker^) , I have not
us'd him for my Secretary these thirteen years:
he entred with the Bishop of (^Rosse^) , and dealt with
him in these Matters against my Knowledge.
   [$ (^Catlin.^) $] (^Bracton^) indeed is an old Writer of our Law,
and by (^Bracton^) he may be a Witness; a Stranger, a
Bondman may be a Witness: Ask you all the Judges
here. [$And the Judges affirmed that he may.$]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] If a Stranger be to give Evidence
whereby Lands should be recovered, you shall not
recover upon that Evidence given by a Stranger.
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] This were a strange Device, that
(^Scots^) might not be Witnesses; for so, if a Man
would commit Treason, and make none privy but
(^Scots^) , the Treason were unpunishable; and so
were a kind of Men found out, with whom a
Man might freely conspire Treason.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] You say my Indictment is only upon the
Statute of 25 (^Edward^) III. that Statute standeth
upon three points, compassing the Death of the
Prince's Person, levying of War against the Prince,
and aiding of the Prince's Enemies; and all these
must be prov'd Overt-fact. If by any way, by any
Overt-fact, you can prove that I have directly
touch'd the Prince's Person, or done any of the said
things that the Statute extendeth to, I will yield
my self guilty. If any thing be doubtful, the
Statute referreth it to the Judgment of the Parliament.
   [$ (^Catlin.^) $] Usage is the best Expounder of the Law,
that is, the common Use how the Statute hath been
taken and expounded; and the same Statute is but
the Declaration of the common Law.
<P 114C1>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] The Preamble of the Statute is to bring
the Laws of Treason to a certainty, that Men
may certainly know what is Treason.
   [$ (^Attorney-Gen.^) $] You complained of your close
keeping, that you had no Books to provide for
your Answer: it seemeth you have had Books
and Counsel, you alledge Books, Statutes, and
(^Bracton^) ; I am sure the study of such Books is not
your Profession.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I have been in Trouble these two Years,
think you that in all this time I have not had cause
to look for my self?
   [$ (^Attorney-Gen.^) $] But if you stand still upon proof,
whether you have done any thing to the
Destruction of the Prince's Person, if the Lords,
upon the Evidence already produc'd, do think the
Matters true in Fact that are already alledg'd
against you, surely the same must needs be
constructed a compassing of the Queen's Death; for the Law
of Treason hath ever been largely construed for
the Prince's safety. Think you that practising
to levy War within the Realm is not Treason?
Yes indeed it is; and a compassing of the Prince's
Death. Sir (^William Stanley's^) Case was this: He
did but send (^Clifford^) over Sea, to hearken and send
him word what (^Perkin Warbeck^) was; that if he
thought (^Perkin^) was such a Man as he was said to
be, he would take his part. This was (^Stanley's^)
Case, and this was judged Treason, and a 
compassing of the King's Death.

   [$Here was read (^Barker's^) Confession the 6th of
(^November^) .$]

   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I never dealt with that Money, nor heard
of it; I dealt not at that time with (^Barker^) , nor
heard any thing of the Rebels, since they went into
(^Flanders^) .
   [$Then was read the Bishop of (^Rosse's^) Confession of
the same Matter, 6 (^November^) , ad 5.
   And again (^Rosse^) , 6 (^November^) , Fo.
   Also (^Rosse^) 29, of 1700 Crowns sent by (^Moreton's^)
means, and what (^Moreton^) was.$]

   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] You hear how the Money was
procured; how it was distributed by the Duke's
Order, and Thanks written by the Countess of
(^Northumberland^) for the receipt of it, which was also
declared to the Duke. You shall hear, that after
the Practice of the Marriage, it was a general
Rule between the (^Scotish^) Queen and the Duke,
That the Bishop of (^Rosse^) should never propone to
the Queen's Majesty's Council, nor deal in any
great Matter, but by the advice and directions of
the Duke of (^Norfolk^) .

   [$Here was read, for the proof thereof, the Bishop
of (^Rosse^) .$]

   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] This is a plain Course.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] What doth this make against me?
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] That he follow'd his Commission,
that he kept his manner of Conference
continually, and that according to that use, the Money
was distributed by your Directions.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] He dealt not with me in a great time, and
I can tell when he broke off and dealt no more
with me; I was never privy to the distribution of
the Money, nor I never spake with (^Barker^) about
it; I was in the Tower at that time.
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] That was when you were not in
the (^Tower^) ; they lurked in (^Flanders^) a while in
great necessity, without Apparel, and suddenly,
with this Money, they were waxed gay; and
<P 114C2>
these Men have confessed that it is distributed by
your Order and Direction.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] None accuse me but three, one absent,
a Stranger, and a Traitor.

<S SAMPLE 7>
<P 115C1>
[^EXAMINATIONS OF HICKFORD AND BANNISTER READ.^]
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] Thus it appeareth, that those the
(^Scotish^) Queen's Friends in (^Scotland^) , for whom she
sorrowed and feared their yielding, were the
Queen's Majesty's Enemies; and how to those the
Duke adhered, those he comforted, for those he
procured the comfortable Letters to be sent, as
you have heard.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I confess it, that I caused the Letters to
be sent, but that I procured the Letters to be
written, I remember not; but therein I trust
(^Bannister's^) Memory.
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] Now for sending Money to relieve 
the Queen's Majesty's Enemies, and touching the
6000 (^l.^) the (^French^) Embassador had 14 hundred
Crowns ready to relieve them, which he sent to
the (^Scotish^) Queen, to know how it should be
bestowed. She would have had the Duke to make it
up three thousand Crowns; she sent one thousand
more her self, and referred the Direction of all to
the Duke himself. The Duke having the chief
Charge of all, willed two thousand Crowns to be
conveyed to the Queen's Majesty's Enemies in
(^Scotland^) . The Bishop of (^Rosse^) had devised, that it
should be sent sewed in (^Panton's^) Doublet. The
Duke was made privy to it on the (^Sunday^) after
(^Bartholomew-Day^) : because (^Panton^) was a (^Scot^) , and
like to be searched, this Device was misliked, so
was the Money delivered to (^Brown^) of (^Shrewsbury^) ;
and so he rehearsed the manner of the delivery
to (^Brown^) , and the Letters in Cypher, as it was
afore rehearsed by Mr. Attorney-General.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I received the Money at (^Thambour's^) hands; 
I was not by at the writing of the Letter in
Cypher.
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] I said not so.

   [$Then was read the Letter to (^Bannister^) : You 
shall receive in a Bag by this Bearer, (^&c.^) $]
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I do not deny the conveying of the
Money; but it never came to the Queen's Enemies
hands.
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] It was out of your Possession; (^Panton^)
was sent before to receive the Money.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Not of my knowledge. And as for
(^Grange^) and (^Ledington^) , I have not heard they were
the Queen's Enemies.
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] That is no matter; for the
Indictment is generally of the Queen's Enemies,
and you know the Money went to the Lord
(^Harris^) .
<P 115C2>
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Lord (^Harris^) was not appointed to have
any part of it. 
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] That is no matter, it was a
comfort to him, being the Queen's Enemy, to be the
Factor, and to have the Countenance and
Distribution of it at his pleasure: Beside that, you
may be sure he would not let all pass without some
share to himself.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] May a Subject be the Queen's Majesty's 
Enemy, while the Prince is her Friend, and in
Amity with her?
   [$ (^Catlin.^) $] In some cases it may be so: As in (^France^) ,
if the Dukedom of (^Britany^) should rebel against the
(^French^) King , and should (during the Amity
between the (^French^) and Queen's Majesty) invade
(^England^) , those (^Britons^) were the (^French^) King's
Subjects, and the Queen's Enemies, though the
(^French^) King remaineth in Amity; and so in your
Case.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] Where was the Proclamation made?
   [$ (^Wilbraham.^) $] The Proclamation was made in
(^England^) , and here it is to be shewed; but the War
it self is sufficient Proclamation. The Queen's
Army was sent against him, and the Queen is not
otherwise bound to proclaim.
   [$ (^Duke.^) $] I trust my Lords the Peers will have
Consideration of me, who they be that accuse me, 
the Bishop of (^Rosse^) and Strangers; and the rest
over-reach'd in Treason themselves.
   [$The Lord Steward ask'd if they had ought else
to say.$]
   [$The Duke said,$] I trust to God and my Truth.
   [$Then the Prisoner was withdrawn.$]
