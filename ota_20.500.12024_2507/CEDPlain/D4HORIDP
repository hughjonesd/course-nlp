DIALOGUE 
BETWIXT
JACK AND WILL,
CONCERNING
THE LORD MAYOR'S GOING TO
MEETING-HOUSES WITH THE SWORD BEFORE
HIM, &C.}]
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] How d'ye Friend (^Will^) ? have you
heard the News?
   [$ (^Will.^) $] What News d'ye mean
(^Jack^) ? We have little cause to fear
ill News, now we have Peace.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] No? I'm sure I have a piece of ill News to
tell you. Did not you hear that my Lord Mayor
went to (^Salters-Hall^) on Sunday last, with the Sword
carried before him?
<P 4>
   [$ (^Will.^) $] To (^Salters-Hall^) , what to do? to a Play, or
a Ball there?
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Pox on ye for a nump-skull'd Fellow, to a
Play or a Ball on Sundays!
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Why all this Fury, (^Jack^) ? I'm sure I have
read a Play that was acted at (^Whitehall^) on a Sunday in
the Blessed Martyr's time, present King, Queen,
Prince, and God knows how many Stars and
Garters: but indeed I don't know whether the Sword
was carried thither in State or no.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Come, come, (^Will^) ; you love to play the
Rogue; you know the Lord Mayor went thither on
no such Account.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Why so? how sho'd I know? d'ye think I
am a Conjurer? What did he go thither for then?
was it to hear Archbishop (^Laud's^) Book of Sports?
I hear my Lord Mayor is a brisk Man, perhaps he
loves Sport and Pastime, and is a good Gamester;
for you know we use to say of such, (^that they play a
Sundays^) .
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Plague on ye, leave off your Banter, I tell
you he went thither to a Conventicle.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Pish, what is that your ill News? I was
afraid you'd have told that he had gone to (^treat
the Pope's Nuncio at Dinner at^) Guidhall; or that you
had had some such frightful Story to tell me, (^as that
the Town was on fire again^) , and we should have been
forc'd to be at the Expence of a (^new Monument^) ,
which would have ruin'd the Orphans to all Intents
and Purposes.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Well well, Friend (^Will^) , tho the Town be
not a fire, I am sure the Church is.
<P 5>
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Nay then Friend (^Jack^) , my Lord Mayor did
very well to carry the (^wooden Sword^) away from it,
for that would have added Fewel to the Flames.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Prethee leave off thy fooling, and let's
discourse the Point in good earnest; thou always
pretendedst to be a true Church-of-England-man                       #
[^SOURCE TEXT HAS England IN ITALICS^] , and
don't ye think that the Lord Mayor's going to a
Conventicle with the Sword is an Injury to the Church of
(^England^) ?
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Why truly (^Jack^) , whether thou believest it
or not, I am as much for the Church of (^England^) as
any Man alive, and for my part I think that my
Lord Mayor's going to Meetings with the Sword is
a very (^noble Act^) : for it seems to me, that by
carrying the Sword thither, he designs to make a Conquest
of 'em for the Church of (^England^) .
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Well, I see you love to banter: but you
know that by going thither with the Sword, he
makes a Surrender of the Church of (^England's^)
Authority to a pitiful little Conventicle.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Why prethee Man, if the Sword be all, no
matter if it had been burnt a dozen Years ago: Thou
knowest very well, that in the late Blessed Reigns it
was the peculiar Doctrine of the Pulpits, that the
Church had no other Weapons but Prayers and
Tears; and why dost make all this pother about a
wooden Sword? Sure thou art not afraid it will
produce as strange Effects as the old rusty Sword in
(^Westminster Abbey^) , with which they say the Norman
Duke conquer'd (^England^) .
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Thou talkst like a mad Man; it's not the
very individual Sword that I mean, but it's the Badg
and Ensign of Authority that is carried away from
<P 6>
the Church to a nasty lowzy Conventicle: a Pox on
'em, damn 'em, I hope to see 'em fast in the (^Pinfold^)
yet once more before I die; and then we'll make
'em pay for their Insolence, and Contempt of the
Church.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Prethee don't rage so: thou hast been so out
of Humour ever since (^Lewis XIV^) was necessitated to
resign his new Conquests, and abjure King (^James^) ,
that thou art fitter for (^Bedlam^) than any Place else.
Come, I tell thee, that my Lord Mayor's carrying
the Sword thither, neither adds to the Authority of
the Meetings, nor derogates from the Authority of
the Church of (^England^) , but rather enlarges her Pale.
But after all the doe and stir you make about the
Church, I believe I may say to you as the little Boy
said to his Mother, (^Mother, what need you talk so much
of the Church? you don't go so often to it^) .
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] That's nothing to you (^Will^) : do you make
out your Assertion, and then I'll say something to
thee.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Have but Patience, and I will. Thou
knowest that the Dissenters are allowed their Meetings by
Act of Parliament, which I hope is another kind of
Authority than my Lord Mayor's Sword; and most
honest Men think it but reasonable they should have
that Liberty, notwithstanding the threatning Words
of the D--n of (^C. that if King^) William (^did not take
away the damn'd Act of Toleration, they'd send him back
again to the Bogs of^) Holland.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Prethee let your Stories alone, and come to
the matter. I own that an Act of Parliament is a
better Authority than my Lord Mayor's Sword.
<P 7>
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Thou knowest also that that Liberty is
allow'd them on condition (^that they subscribe to the
Doctrine of the Church of^) England.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] I do.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Why then it's certain that my Lord Mayor
could not go thither with nor without his Sword, if
the Dissenters did not qualify themselves according
to the Terms of the Act.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] No, he could not.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Is it not plain then, that if my Lord Mayor's
Sword signify any thing, it comes to defend the
Doctrine of the Church of (^England^) at the Meeting as
well as in the Church? And is not his Presence there
with the Ensigns of Authority an Evidence that the
Doctrine of our Church is preach'd there? whereas
in former times the Meetings were look'd upon to be
quite another thing than the Church of (^England^) .
So that I think it is plain to any Man's Understanding,
that his being there is only a Declaration that the
Pale of the Church is enlarg'd, and that we now
own them for Brethren, that by the heat of some ill
Men were formerly accounted our Enemies!
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Nay but you mistake the Matter. The
Meetings have only a Liberty, but ours is the Church
establish'd by Law; their Meetings must not be
accounted the Church, because they have neither
Bishops, nor Ceremonies, nor Benefices.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Prethee (^Jack^) don't talk such Nonsense. The
Meetings are as much establish'd by Law as the
Church of (^England^) , if an Act of Parliament be a
Law: and you know that it's only the Acts of
Parliament that defend you in the practice of those
things wherein you differ from them. And our wise
<P 8>
Law-givers finding the mischievous Consequence of
having one Party of Protestants impower'd to
destroy another that differed from them only in
Circumstantials, as if they had been Hereticks,
Schismaticks, and God knows what, thought fit to take
those Edg-tools out of the hands of a set of Men that
know not how to use them, but to the wrong of
their Neighbours, and to throw the Nation into
Convulsions; and have granted Liberty to cur
Brethren to worship God in the very same Ordinances
that we do, tho they don't observe all those Modes
and Forms which by our selves are accounted
indifferent.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] How do you mean indifferent? Is it a thing
indifferent to observe the Directions and Commands
of the Church? that's fine Work indeed!
   [$ (^Will.^) $] By Indifferent I mean a thing that may be
done or left undone, and so the Law means;
otherwise it would never have left me at my liberty to go
to a Meeting where there are no Ceremonies, or to
a Church where there are Ceremonies.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] I am sure the Church is Apostolical, and
enjoin'd those things upon her Members on pain of
Excommunication, both as to Belief and Practice,
if we may believe her Canons.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Thou art in a grand Mistake, (^Jack^) . I grant
you there was once such a Set of Men as arrogated
to themselves the Name of the Church, that did so;
but you know that the greatest Divines of the Church
of (^England^) did always account those things
indifferent even in Queen (^Elizabeth's^) time: Read but the
Lord Bishop of (^Salisbury's^) Letters, and you will
there find plain Proofs of it, under the Hands of our
<P 9>
greatest Bishops to the Divines in (^Switzerland^) : and
for what hath been done since, you know that it was
a Court, and a Popish Faction that enjoin'd those
things on such and such Penalties, merely to widen
the Differences amongst Protestants, that they might
swallow up both our Religion and Liberties; but
the Church of (^England^) hath altered her Mind
since.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] How! the Church of (^England^) alter'd her
Mind? What? d'ye make her akin to (^Mahomet^) ?
as if her Religion depended upon the Moon, and
were as changeable as she.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Prethee not so fast (^Jack^) , I know what I say;
the Church of (^England^) hath alter'd her Mind oftner
than once; and no Disgrace to her neither.
Protestants hold no Church nor Council Infallible; we
have indeed an infallible Rule, the Scriptures, but
so long as we are clogg'd with Humanity, we are
either like to come short of it, or shoot beyond it;
and in both these Cases must alter our Mind, or set
our selves in opposition to the Almighty.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] This is Fanatical Cant. When did the
Church of (^England^) alter her Mind?
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Nay (^Jack^) , if you be so forgetful, I'll tell
you: [^---^]
[^WILL'S SPEECH OMITTED.^]
<P 10>
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Thou hast said a great deal to convince
me; but pray let me see how the Church of
(^England^) hath alter'd her Mind as to the Point of the
Dissenters.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Why they have alter'd it in giving them
their Liberty by a Law, whereas they formerly
persecuted them.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] How strangely do you talk? It was the
Parliament that gave them the Liberty, and not the
<P 11>
Church; if she had done it, it must have been by
Convocation.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Nay (^Jack^) , you talk strangely, and not I.
Is not all the People of (^England^) represented by the
Parliament?
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Who doubts that?
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Is not the Church then represented in
Parliament?
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] That's another thing: The Church is the
Bishops and their Clergy.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Grant it be so: [^---^]
[^WILL'S SPEECH OMITTED.^]
<P 12>
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Nay now thou speakest big, (^Will^) .
   [$ (^Will.^) $] I have reason for what I say. It's the
Parliament that hath settled the Limits of our Church,
and given her all the Authority she has, otherwise
'tis a mere Bull to call her the Church by Law
establish'd; and that same Authority may enlarge her
Bounds and Pale when they please: and therefore
to be so angry at the Parliament for taking in all
those that embrace the Doctrine of the Church
under the Protection of the Law, tho it has not
admitted 'em to partake of the Benefits, is a horrid
piece of Ingratitude to that August Assembly, who
have all along defended the Church of (^England^) in the
Possession of what she enjoys, more than her
Brethren the Dissenters; and by this Liberty the
Parliament have added to her Strength, by giving those
a Legal Authority to defend her Doctrine without
Wages, which so many of those that profess
themselves to be her Sons, have either slily undermin'd
<P 13>
or but faintly asserted, notwithstanding their
Benefices. And you know, (^Jack^) , that the Dissenters
have been as stanch Patriots of their Country, and
Defenders of our Religion and Liberties, as any
Men in the Nation: and therefore it's the Interest
of all Men that wish well to either of 'em, to
promote a hearty Union amongst Protestants of all
Denominations whatsoever. So that for my own part
I can see no harm in my Lord Mayor's carrying the
Sword to a Meeting as well as to a Church; it has
heard Passive Obedience preach'd long enough, and
it will do it no hurt to be taught the Doctrine of
Self defence in its turn: for if the latter Doctrine
had not been more serviceable to us than the
former, we had neither had a Protestant Church nor
Meeting House to have carried the Sword to long
e're this.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Well, but for all that you can't but say it's
an ill thing to carry the Sword thither.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Prethee in what sense is it ill? For my part
I think the Sword ought to be carried thither rather
than any where else; because to give the Dissenters
their due, they always held that it was lawful to
make use of the Sword in defence of their Religion
and Liberties, as well against Tyrants at home, as
from Invaders abroad; whereas many of our
Churchmen would allow of no other Weapons against a
Tyrant at home but Prayers and Tears: but to say
the truth, and no more, that was only while the
Tyrant impowered them to tyrannize over the Bodies,
Consciences and Estates of their Fellow Christians
and Subjects; for when he came to touch themselves,
nay (^but one of their Fingers^) , as a famous Author has
<P 14>
it, they made use of Guns and Spears, instead of
Prayers and Tears, against him; and (^let him
understand^) , as the same Author says, (^that they had given
him only a spiritual Kingdom, and not a Kingdom of
this World: for if his Kingdom had been of this World,
then would his Servants have fought for him^) .
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] Ay but a pox on't, tho we allow our selves
to do so, yet we would not have the Dissenters use
the Sword; ours is the Apostolical Church, and
they are but Schismaticks.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] That's easier said than proved; they hold
the Doctrines of our Church, and live up to it as
well, if not better than many of our selves: so that
we must not call Men Schismaticks for differing from
us in those things which we our selves account
Indifferent. And as for the Sword, tho some
Gentlemen have thought fit to endeavour the preventing
its being carried to Meetings by an Order, I cannot
think that the Act of Parliament did ever intend to
make better Provision for our Swords than for our
Souls, or for the Ensigns of Magistracy than for
Magistrates themselves. If our Legislators had thought
the going to Meetings would be either hurtful to the
Bodies, Estates, Liberties, or Consciences of
English Men, they would never have allow'd them at
all; and if they had thought that the Nation would
be any ways endangered by Magistrates going to
Meetings, they would have made an Exception
against it. So that for any Party of Men to take
upon them to bind up any Person, especially a
Magistrate of so great Power and Trust as the Lord
Mayor of (^London^) ; where the Law has left him at
liberty, seems to me to be a manifest Incroachment
<P 15>
upon the Legislative Power: and I wish with all my
Heart there may not be more of Envy and
particular Pique, (in such especially, that are angry to see
the Lord Mayor have more Courage than some of
his Predecessors) than of Zeal for the Church of
(^England^) , at the bottom of this Opposition: for my
own part I know not why those Dissenters who have
so cordially contributed to deliver us from Tyranny
and Popery, should be suffered still to languish and
groan under the Yoke of an Ecclesiastical Tyranny
themselves, and be deprived of the Liberties and
Privileges that other English Protestants enjoy. So
farewell (^Jack^) till next Meeting.
   [$ (^Jack.^) $] I have not had such a rude Mercurial this
good while; I'll go to (^Sam's^) , and get a Glass of
Cordial Water, and then to the Commons, and recruit
my self over a Bottle, and muster up more Forces
against next Meeting. Farewel.
