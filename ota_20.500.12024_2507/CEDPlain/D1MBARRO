[}A BRIEF OF THE EXAMINATION OF ME 
HENRY BARROWE THE 19. OF NOUEMBER. 1586. BEFORE THE
ARCH B. ARCH D. AND DR. CUSSINS: AS NEERE AS MY MEMORIE
COULD CARY: BEING AT LAMBETH.}]
[^INTRODUCTORY REMARKS OMITTED.^]
[$Arch B.$] Barrowe / is your name Barrowe?
[$B.$] Yea.
[$A.$] It is told me / that yow refuse to receiue or obey our 
letter / know yow what yow doe? it is from the high commissioners / 
and this man a pursuvant.
[$B.$] I refused to receive or obey that letter at that time.
[$A.$] Why so?
[$B.$] Because I was vnder arrest / and imprisoned without warrant /
and against law: and there fore now it was too late to bring the
letter.
[$A.$] Why / may not a Counsellor commit to prison by his bare
commandement? [$ (alledging how the Aldermen of London doe daily.) $]
[$B.$] That is not the question / what a counsellor may doe: but
whither this man may doe it without warrant / by the law of the land:
[$ (pointing to the keeper of the Clinke.) $]
[$A.$] Know yow the law of the land?
[$B.$] Very litle / yet was I of Grayes Inne some yeares. [$ (Then his
two Doctours and he / derided mine vnskilfulnes.) $] Let this passe: I
look for litle help by
<P A2V>
law against yow: I pray yow why haue yow imprisoned me / and after 
this manner sent for me?
[$A.$] That yow shal know vpon yowr oath: wil yow sweare?
[$B.$] I hold it lawful to sweare / so it be done with due order and
circumstances. 
[$A.$] Reach a book / hold it him.
[$B.$] What shal we doe with this?
[$A.$] Lay your hand vpon it man.
[$B.$] To what purpose?
[$A.$] To sweare.
[$B.$] I Vse to sweare by no bookes.
[$A.$] Yow shal not sweare by the book / but by God onely.
[$B.$] So I purpose when I sweare.
[$Cus.$] Did yow neuer take an oath at an Assise before the Iudges
there?
[$B.$] No.
[$Cus.$] But would yow refuse there to lay yowr hand on a book and
sweare?
[$B.$] Yea.
[$C.$] Then would your testimonie not be taken.
[$A.$] Why man the book is no part of the oath / it is but a
cerimonie.
[$B.$] A needlesse and wicked ceremonie.
[$A.$] Why know yow what yow say? know yow what book it is? it is the
Bible.
[$B.$] I wil sweare by no Bible.
[$C.$] Scismaticks are clamorous alwayes. it is a perpetual note
to know them by.
[$A.$] Mr. Dr. Cussins saith true / such were the Donatistes alwayes
in the counsels / and such art thow and al other scismatiks such as 
thow art.
[$B.$] Say yowr pleasure / God forgiue yow: I am neither scismatike
nor clamourous: I answer but yowr demandes / if yow wil I wil be
silent.
[$A.$] Wel wil yow lay your hand on the Bible and take an oath.
[$B.$] I vse to ioyne no creatures to the name of God in an oath.
[$A.$] Neither shal yow / this is but a custome commanded by law.
[$B.$] The law ought not to commannd a wicked custome.
[$A.$] Why / is it not lawful to lay your hand on a book?
[$B.$] Yes / but not in an oath.
[$A.$] Wil yow lay your hand in my hand, and sweare?
[$B.$] No.
[$A.$] Wil yow lay your hand on y=e= table and sweare?
[$B.$] No.
[$A.$] Wil yow hold your hand towards heauen and sweare?
[$B.$] That is not amisse: but I wil use my libertie.
[$A.$] Why yow hold it lawful to lay your hand on the table and
sweare?
[$B.$] Yea, so it be not commanded and made of necessitie.
[$A.$] Why, the booke is y=s= like: it is nothing of the oath but
a thing indifferent.
[$B.$] If it be nothing of the othe / why doe yow so peremptorilie
inioyne it? and if it be indifferent as yow say it is / then doe I wel
in not vsing it.
[$A.$] Nay / yow doe not wel in refusing it / for therin yow shew
yowr self disobedient to the higher powers set over yow by God.
[$B.$] Euen now yow said it was a thing indifferent: if it be so /
ther is no power can bring me in bondage to my libertie.
[$A.$] Where finde yow that?
[$B.$] In S Paul. 1. Cor. [$ (^The Arch B. Archd.^) Dr. Cussins / al 
denied it. I affirmed it. a litle testament in greek and latine was 
brought me / and a Bible I looked for [^SOURCE TEXT: foe^] the place 
but could not finde it: great fault was in my memorie / ffor I looked 
in the 10. chapter / neither in deed could I bethinke me where to 
finde it / they so interrupted me.$]
<P A3R>
[$A.$] Your devinitie is like yowr law.
[$B.$] The word of God is not the worse for my il memorie.
[$A.$] Yow speak not as yow thinck / for yow are prowd.
[$B.$] I haue smal cause to be prowd of my memorie / yow see y=e=
default of it: but the Apostle saith it. [$Againe they al denyed
it.$] Yow then haue no cause to condemne my memorie / seing yow al 
haue vtterly forgotten this sayeng. [$Then repeated I the words: Al
thinges are lawful for me / but I wil not be brought in bondage to my
libertie. Then they recited. Rom. 14. and 1. Corint. 8. al thinges are
lawful for me / but al thinges are not expedient. I said I meant not
that place.$]
[$A.$] I would like it wel if yow cited your place in Greek or
Latine.
[$B.$] Why yow vnderstand English: is not the word of God in English?
[$Then Cussin began to speak of (\indefinita propositio\) , but
whervpon I can not cal to remembranc: i [^SO IN SOURCE TEXT 
AT LINE BREAK^] I told him we were now about the new Testament / 
it might be if he had asked me that question when I knew him in 
Cambridge / I should then haue answered him he forthwith called to 
remembrance of what howse I was.$]
[$A.$] Were yow then of Cambridge?
[$B.$] Yea / I knew yow there. [$He said he was there before I was
borne. I said it might be. Then he entred into discourse of his 
antiquitie. Then he asked me if I had read books / as Calvin / Beza 
etc. I answered that I had read more then ynough: But yet I know not
why I am emprisoned.$]
[$A.$] It is reported that yow come not to church / are disobedeent to
her maiestie / and say that ther is not a true church in England / 
what say yow / haue yow at any time said thus?
[$B.$] These are reportes. when yow produce yowr testimonie 
[^SOURCE TEXT: testtmonie^] I wil answer.
[$A.$] But I wil better beleeue yow / upon yowr oath / then them: how
say yow / wil yow sweare?
[$B.$] I wil know what I sweare to / before I sweare.
[$A.$] ffirst sweare: and then if any thing be vnlawfully demaunded /
yow shal not answer.
[$B.$] I haue not learned so to sweare / I wil first know and consider
of the matter before I take an oath. [$Thus many thinges being 
alleaged to and fro by vs, the Arch B. commaunded Cussin to recorde / 
that I refused to sweare vpon a book.$]
[$B.$] yea / and set downe also / that I wil not sweare thus at random 
[^SOURCE TEXT: randon^] / but first I wil know and consider of the 
thinges I sweare vnto / whither they require an oath.
[$A.$] Wel / when were yow at church?
[$B.$] That is nothing to yow.
[$A.$] Yow are a scismatick / a recusant / a seditious person / [$etc.
with many such like.$]
[$B.$] Say what yow list of me / I freelie forgiue yow.
[$A.$] I care not for yowr forgiuenes.
[$B.$] But if yow offend me / yow ought to seek it / while yow are in
the way with me.
[$A.$] When were yow at church?
[$B.$] I haue answered that in an other place / it belongeth not to
yow.
[$A.$] Why / are yow indited?
[$B.$] I am.
[$A.$] Yet belongeth it to vs [^SOURCE TEXT: ys^] . I wil not onely 
medle with yow / but arraigne yow as an heretick before me.
[$B.$] Yow
<P A3V>
shal doe no more then God wil: Erre I may / but hereticke wil I never
be.
[$A.$] Wil yow come to church hereafter?
[$B.$] ffuture thinges are in the Lords handes: if I doe not / yow
haue a law.
[$A.$] Haue yow spoken these wordes of the church of England?
[$B.$] When yow produce your witnesse I wil answer.
[$A.$] But vpon your oath I wil beleeue yow.
[$B.$] But I wil not accuse my self. [$Then began he againe to charge
me with scisme / sedition / heresie.$]
[$B.$] Yow are lawlesse: I had rather yow produced yowr witnesse.
[$A.$] Of what occupation are yow?
[$B.$] A christian.
[$A.$] So are we al.
[$B.$] I deny that.
[$A.$] But are yow a minister?
[$B.$] No.
[$A.$] A scholemaister?
[$B.$] No.
[$A.$] What then / of no trade of life?
[$B.$] In your letter / yow know my trade in the superscription.
[$A.$] Yow are then a gentleman.
[$B.$] After the manner of our conntrie a gentleman.
[$A.$] Serue yow any man?
[$B.$] No I am Gods freeman.
[$A.$] Haue yow landes?
[$B.$] No / nor fees.
[$A.$] How liue yow?
[$B.$] By Gods goodnes / and my freinds
[$A.$] Haue yow a father aliue?
[$B.$] Yea.
[$A.$] Wher dwelleth he / in Norffolke?
[$B.$] Yea.
[$A.$] Wher dwel yow / in London?
[$B.$] No.
[$A.$] Wel can yow finde sufficient suretie for your good behaviour?
[$B.$] Yea / as sufficient as yow can take.
[$A.$] What / yow cannot haue the Queene?
[$B.$] Neither can yow take her / she is the iudge of her law: yet for
my good behauiour / I suppose I could get her word.
[$A.$] Doth she know yow then?
[$B.$] I know her.
[$A.$] Els were it pitie of your life.
[$B.$] Not so.
[$A.$] Can yow haue any of these that came with yow / to be bound for
yow?
[$B.$] I know not / I thinke I can.
[$A.$] What know yow them not?
[$B.$] I know one of them.
[$A.$] What is he?
[$B.$] A gentleman of Graies ynne.
[$A.$] What cal yow him?
[$B.$] Lacie.
[$A.$] But know yow what band yow should enter / yow are bound hereby
to frequent our churches.
[$B.$] I vnderstand yow of my good behauiour.
[$A.$] And in it is this conteyned: and so yow had forfeyted your
bond at the first.
[$B.$] Wel now I know yowr minde / I wil enter no such bande.
[$A.$] Then I wil send yow to prison. [$Then called he Watson the
pursuva~t / and D. Cussins a part into a windowe / where he made a
warrant to send me to prison.$]
[$B.$] Yow shal not touch one haire of my head / without the wil of my
heauenly father.
[$A.$] Nay I wil doe this to rectifie yow.
[$B.$] Consider what yow doe / yow shal one day answer it.
[$A.$] Yow wil not sweare: yow wil not enter bond for your 
appearance [^SOURCE TEXT: appcarance^] .
[$B.$] I wil put in band for my baile in the prison / and for my true
imprisonment.
[$A.$] Nay / that wil not serue the turne / Mr. Doctor / enter these
thinges. [$Then Cussins wrote that I refused to sweare / and enter
bond.$]
[$B.$] I wil send some to yow to conferre. 
[$A.$] That were more requisite
before my imprisonment. [^...^]
[^EXAMINATION OF BARROWE CONTINUES 8 DAYS LATER, AGAIN BEFORE THE 
ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY.^]
<P A4R>
[^...^]
[$C.$] Wil yow then now sweare?
[$B.$] I must first know to what.
[$C.$] So yow shal afterward.
[$B.$] I wil not sweare vnlesse I know before.
[$C.$] Wel I wil thus far satisfie your humour. [$London bega~ to
interrupt / but Cant / cut him of / and produced a paper of 
obiections against me / which he delivered to one Beadle to read.$]
[^BARROWE'S SUMMARY OF THE PAPER OMITTED.^]
<P A4V>
[^...^]
[$L.$] How say yow Mr. Deane of Pauls / here is for yow / yow haue
written a catechism /
[$Cant.$] This fellow deales indifferently / he makes vs al alike.
Thus far haue I satisfied yow: now yow know what yow shal sweare
vnto: how say yow / wil yow sweare now?
[$Lond.$] My Lordes grace doth not shew this favour to many.
[$Can.$] ffetch a book.
[$Bar.$] It is needles.
[$C.$] Why / wil yow not sweare now.
[$B.$] An oath is a matter of great importance / and requireth great
consideration. But I wil answer yow truly / Much of the matter of
this bil is true / but the forme is false.
[$C.$] Goe to sirra / answer directlie / wil yow sweare? reach him a
book.
[$B.$] Ther is more cause to sweare mine accuser: I wil not sweare.
[$C.$] Where is his keeper? yow shal not prattle here. Away with him:
clap him vp close / close / let no man come at him: I wil make him tel
an other tale / yer I haue done with him.
[^EXAMINATION OF BARROWE CONTINUES SEVERAL MONTHS LATER. HE IS
COMMANDED TO LAY HIS HAND ON THE BIBLE.^]
<P B1R>
[$Bar.$] To what ende?
[$Cant.$] To sweare.
[$B.$] I haue not learned to sweare by any creatures.
[$Cant.$] This is the word of God / the Bible.
[$B. I began to open the book / and meant in deed to haue asked him / 
if the Apocrypha scripture / and notes which were in it / were the 
word of God: but Cant. belike suspecting some such matter would not
suffer me to look into it / to whom then I answered that that booke 
was not the eternal Word of God / that eternal God himselfe / by whom
onely I must sweare / and not by any bookes or Bibles.$]
[$Cant.$] So yow shal sweare by God.
[$Bar.$] To what purpose then is this booke vrged? I may sweare by
nothing besides him / nor by nothing with him.
[$Winch.$] How proue yow that?
[$B.$] It is so commanded in the book of the law. (^Deut.^) 6. and
10. Chapt. so expounded by sundrie of the prophets / by Christ
himselfe and his Apostles.
[$Cant.$] Wel wil yow sweare that yow wil answer nothing but the
truth / and the whole truth / to such Interr. as we shal demaund of
yow?
[$B.$] I haue learned to know the matter before I either sweare or
answer.
[$Cant.$] Set downe that he wil not sweare.
[$L. C. Iustice.$] Yow shal onely sweare to answer the truth: if 
any vnlawful thing be demaunded of yow / yow need not answere.
[$B.$] My Lord / euery truth requireth not an oath / ther must great
regard and reuerence be vsed in an oath / and an oath for
confirmation ought to be the ende of al strife: My Lo. if I should
erre / and deliuer it vpon mine oath for truth / it were a double
sinne / likewise if I should eyther not know / not remember / or not
vtter the whole truth / I were by such a rash oath forsworne: But by
Gods grace I wil answer nothing but the truth.
[$Cant.$] A Christian mans word ought to be as true as his oath / we
wil proceed with yow without your oath / [$ (and taking a paper of
Interr. in his hand / said / ) $] what say yow to this. Is it lawful 
to say the Pater noster publickly in the church / or priuatly, as a
prayer or no?
[$B.$] I know not what yow meane by your Pater noster / vnlesse
peradventure that forme for prayer which our sauiour Christ taught
his disciples / commonly called the Lordes prayer.
[$Cant.$] I so meane. [^...^]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P B3V>
[^EXAMINATION OF BARROWE CONTINUES AT A LATER DATE.^]
[$L. Treas.$] Why are yow in prison Barrowe?
[$B.$] I am in prison my Lo. vpon the statute made for recusantes.
[$L. Treas.$] Why wil yow not goe to church?
[$B.$] My whole desire is to come to the church of God.
[$L. Tre.$] Thow art a fantastical fellow I see / but why not to our
churches?
[$B.$] My Lo. the causes are great and many / it were too long to
shew them in particuler: but breifly my Lo. I can not come to your 
church / because al the profane and wicked of the lande are receiued 
into the body of your church / 2. Yow haue a false and Antichristian 
ministery set ouer your church. 3. Neither worship yow God aright / 
but after an jdolatrous and superstitious ma~ner: 4. and your church 
is not gouerned by Christes Testament / but by the Romish courtes and 
canons / etc.
[$L. Tr.$] Here is matter ynough in deed: I perceiue thow takest
delight to be an author of this new religion. [$The L. Chanc. said he
neuer heard such stuffe before in al his life.$]
[$B. As I was about to shew that neither I was an author of this
religio~ / and that it was not new as they supposed: the B. of Lo.
interrupted me / and asked me wherin their worship was jdolatrous?
The L. Treas. also demaunded the same question.$]
[$B.$] Ther is nothing els in that book of your common prayer:
[$being demaunded some particulers / I shewed that their saintes
daies / eues / fastes / idol feastes / etc.$]
[$Lond.$] Stay there: why / is it not lawful to keep a memorial of
the Saintes in the church?
[$B.$] Not after your manner: it is jdolatrie.
[$Lond.$] How proue yow that?
[$B.$] By the 1. commaundement.
[$Lond.$] Why / that is / thow shalt haue no other Gods but me. What
of that?
[$B.$] The word is / Thow shalt haue no other Gods before my face. We
are therfore forbidden to giue any part of Gods worship to any
creature.
[$Lond.$] Why / neither doe we.
[$B.$] Yes / yow celebrate a day / and sanctifie an eaue / and cal 
them by their names / yow make a feast / and deuise a worship vnto 
them.
[$L. Tr.$] Why / may we not cal the day after their names? is not that
in our libertie?
[$B.$] No my Lord.
[$L. Tr.$] How proue yow that?
[$B$] In the beginning of the booke it is written that God himselfe
named al the dayes / the first the second / etc.
[$L. Tr.$] Why then we may not cal them Sunday / Monday etc.
[$B.$] We are otherwise taught to cal them in the booke of God.
[$L. Tr.$] Why thow they selfe selfe callest it the Lordes day.
[$B.$] And so the holy Ghost calleth it in the 1. of the Reuelation.
[$Lond.$] We haue nothing in our saintes dayes / but that which is
taken forth of the Scriptures.
[$B.$] In that yow say true / for yow finde no Saintes dayes in the
Scriptures.
[$Lond.$] We finde their Histories and deedes in the Scripture.
[$B.$] But not their dayes and festiuals in the Scripture. [$The
Lo. Buckh. then said / I was a proud spirit. The L. Treas. said I had
a hotte braine: and taking into his hande a book of common prayer /
which lay on the boord / read certaine of the collectes for the
<P B4R>
Saintes / and shewed that the Epistles and Gospels were part of the
Scripture: and asked me what I could mislike therin?$]
[$B.$] I mislike al / for we ought not so to vse Scriptures or 
prayers.
[$Lond.$] May we not make commemoration of the saintes liues in the
church.
[$B.$] Not after yowr manner / to giue peculier dayes / eues / 
fastes / worship / feastes vnto them.
[$L. Tr.$] But what is there jdolatrous?
[$B.$] Al / for we ought not so to vse the Scriptures.
[$Lond.$] What not in commemoration of the Saintes?
[$B.$] As I haue said / not after yowr manner.
[$L. Tr.$] But what is euil here?
[$B.$] All my Lo. for by abusing the Scripture we may make it an
jdol The circumstances make euil thinges / of themselues good / as in
the massebook from whence this stuffe is fetched there are sundry 
good collectes and places of scripture / which their superstitious 
abuse make abhominable and euil. Likewise coniurers make many good 
prayers which the circumstances also make euil. [$Here the Lo. Buckh. 
said I was out of my wittes.$]
[$B.$] No my Lo. I speak the wordes of sobernes and truth / as I 
could make plaine if I might be suffered.
[$L. Tr.$] Here we pray / that our liues may be such as theirs was
void of couetousnes.
[$B.$] So ought we to doe / and not to reade or haue any parte of the
scripture without fruite / and to follow and flee that which we finde
praised and discommended in them: yet ought we not to vse the
scriptures in this manner to dayes and times / neither to be thus
restreyned or stinted in our prayers / as to be tied to this forme of
wordes / place / time / manner / kneele / stand etc.
[$L. Buckh.$] This fellow delighteth to heare himselfe speake.
[$ (The L. Chanc. also spake some what at that time / which I cannot
cal to remembrance as yet) Then the Arch B. also spake many thinges
against me / of smal effect / which I haue also forgotten / onely this 
I remember he said / I was a strower of errors / and that therfore he
committed me.$]
[$B.$] In deed yow committed me halfe a yeare close prisoner in the
Gatehowse / and I neuer vntil now vnderstood the cause why / neither
as yet know I what errors they be / shew them therfore I pray yow.
[$The L. Buckh. againe said I was a presumtuous spirit.$]
[$B.$] My Lo. al spirits must be tried and iudged by the word of
God: but if I erre my Lo. it is meet I should be shewed wherin.
[$L. Chanc.$] Ther must be streighter lawes made for such fellowes.
[$B.$] Would to God ther were my Lo. our iourny should be the shorter.
[$L. Tr.$] Yow complained to vs of iniustice / wherin haue yow wrong?
[$B.$] My Lo. in that we are thus imprisoned without due trial.
[$L. Tr.$] Why / yow said yow were condemned vpon the statute.
[$B.$] Vniustly / my Lo. that statute was not made for vs.
[$L. Tr.$] Ther must be streighter lawes made for yow.
[$B.$] O my Lo. speak more comfortablie / we haue sorrowes ynough.
[$L. Tr.$] In deed thow lookest as if thow hadst a troubled
conscience.
[$B.$] No I praise God for
<P B4V>
it: but it is a woeful thing that our Princes sworde should thus be
drawen against her faithful subiectes.
[$The L. Tr. answered that the Queenes sword was not as yet drawen
against vs. Then in a word or two I complayning of the misery and
lingring close imprisonment which we suffer: the L. Tr: demaunded if
we had had no conference. The B. of Lond. answered that sundrie had
bene with vs as D. Some / Grauiat and others / but we mocked them that
came vnto vs.$]
[$B.$] That is not true / the Lord knoweth: we mock no creature.
Neither doe I know / or haue euer seene / to my remembrance / that
Grauiat yow speak of. But miserable phisitians are yow al / for Mr.
Some he indeed was with me / but neuer would enter disputation: he
said / he came not therefore / but in reasoning manner to know some 
what of my minde more cleerly. [^...^]
[^THIRD PERSON NARRATIVE OMITTED.^]
[$B.$] The Lord knoweth I am ignorant / I haue no learning to boast
of: but this I know / that yow are voide of al true learning and
godlines.
[$L. Buckh.$] See the spirit of this man.
[$Then requested I conference againe / and that in writing: which was
againe by Cant. very peremtorilie denyed. He said that he had matter
to cal me before him for an hereticke.$]
[$B.$] That shal yow neuer doe: yow know my former answer to that
matter: wel erre I may / but hereticke / by the grace of God wil I
neuer be.
[$L. Buckh.$] That is wel said.
[$The L. Tr: then taking vp a paper of (^Somes^) abstract questions /
which lay among the Bs euidence against me / read this: That I held
it vnlawful to enacte a law that the ministers shal liue by tithes /
or the people pay them: and demaunded of me / whither I held tithes
vnlawful?$]
[$B.$] My Lo. they are abrogated and vnlawful.
[$L. Tr.$] Why / thow wouldest [^wouldest IS CATCHWORD, BUT IS NOT 
REPEATED ON FOLLOWING PAGE.^]
<P C1R>
haue the minister liue of somewhat / wherof should he liue?
[$B.$] (\Ex pura eleemosyna,\) of clere almes as Christ in his
TestamenT hath ordeyned / and as he and his Apostles.
[$L. Tr.$] But how if the people wil not giue?
[$B.$] Such are not the people of God.
[$L. Tr.$] But what shal the ministers doe in the meane time?
[$B.$] Not stand a minister to such / neither take the goods of the
prophane.
[$L. Tr.$] Where canst thow shew me now in the Scriptures that the
ministers now ought not to liue vpon tithes? [^...^]
[^BARROWE'S REFERENCE TO BIBLE TEXTS OMITTED.^]
[$B.$] Why / the wordes of the text are these: If the preisthod be
changed / then of necessitie must ther be a change of the law: and
yow cannot deny but that tithes were a part of that law: [$alleging /
(^Num. 18.^) $]
[$L. Tr.$] What / wouldst thow haue him to haue al my goodes?
[$B.$] No my Lo. but I would haue yow to withhold none of your goodes
from helping him: neither rich nor pore are exemted from this duty.
[$ffurder I shewed / that if the minister had thinges necessarie / as
food and rayment / he ought to hold him self contented: neither ought
the church to giue him more. Then had we some talke concerning the
word Preist: the L. Tr. said that the ministers now were not to be
called preistes.$]
[$B.$] If they receiue tithes they are preistes. Moreouer they be
called preistes in the law.
[$Lond.$] Why / what is the word presbyter / I pray yow?
[$B.$] An elder.
[$Lond.$] What in age onely?
[$B.$] No / Timothie was a yong man.
[$Lond.$] Presbyter is latine for a preist.
[$B.$] It is no latine word / but deriued / and signifieth the same
which the greek word doth / which is an Elder.
[$Lon.$] What makest thow a preist?
[$B.$] Him that doth offer sacrifices / for so it is written euery
where in the law. 
[$As we were thus reasoning / the L. Chanc. asked me if I knew
not those two men (pointing to Cant. and Lond.) $]
[$B.$] Yes my Lo. I haue cause to know them.
[$L. Chanc.$] But what is not this the Bp. of London?
[$B.$] I know him for no Bishop my Lo.
[$L. Ch.$] What is he then?
[$B.$] His name is Elmar my Lo. [$ (The Lord pardon my fault / that
I laid him not open for a wolfe / a bloody persecutor and Apostata.
But by this time / the Wardens man plucked me vp.) $]
[$L. Chanc.$] What is that man? [$ (pointing to Cant.) $]
[$B.$] [$The Lord gaue me the spirit of boldnes / so that I
answered:$] He is a monster / a miserable compound / I know not what 
to make him: he is neither Ecclesiastical nor ciuil / euen that second
Beast spoken of in the Reuelation.
[$L. Treas.$] Wher is that place / shew it.

[}THE ANSWERS OF JOHN GRENEWOOD}]
[^REMAINDER OF HEADING OMITTED.^]
[$Q.$] What is your name?
[$A.$] John. Grenewood.
[$Q.$] Lay yowr hand vpen the book / yow must take an oath.
[$A.$] I wil sweare by the name of God if ther be any need / but not
by or vpon a book.
[$Q.$] We wil then examine yow without an oath. Are yow a minister?
[$A.$] No / I was one after your orders.
[$Q.$] Who disgraded yow?
[$A.$] I disgraded my self through Gods mercy by repentance.
[$ (then after many wordes / they brought forth a paper conteyning
certaine articles in manner of questions as foloweth) $]
[$Q.$] Is it lawful to vse the Lordes prayer publickly or privatly as
a prayer / or no?
[$A.$] It is a doctrine to direct al our prayers by: but seing it
conteyneth the doctrine of the holy Scripture / no man can vse the
same as a private or publick prayer / because he hath not present
need to aske al the peticions therin conteyned / at one time: neither
can comprehend them with feeling and faith.
[$Q.$] Is it lawful or no? I wil heare no pratling.
[$A.$] It is not lawful for any thing I can see by the Scripture / for
ther is no commaundement to say the very wordes ouer: and Christ and
his Apostles prayed in other wordes according to their present
necessitie.
[$Q.$] Is it lawful to vse any stinted prayers either publickly or
privatly in prayer?
[$A.$] They are Apocrypha / and may not be vsed in the publick
assemblie: the word / and the graces of Gods spirit / are onely to be
vsed there.
[$Q.$] Answer directly / is it lawful to vse them publickly or
privatly?
<P C2R>
[$A.$] Paul saith in Rom. 8. the spirit of God maketh request for
vs / and that we know not what to aske / but the spirit helpeth our
infirmities
[$Q.$] Answer directly.
[$A.$] It is not lawful to vse stinted prayers invented by man /
either publickly or privatly for any thing I can see by the
Scriptures.
[$Q.$] What say yow then to the book of common prayer / is it
superstitious popish and jdolatrous / yea or no?
[$A.$] I beseech yow that I may not be vrged by your law: I haue
thus long bene close prisoner / and therfore desire yow to shew me
wherfore / and not now to entangle me by your law.
[$Q.$] Is it not yowr law now as wel as ours: it is the Queenes law:
Yow are a good subiect.
[$A.$] I am obedient as a true subiect. But I took it we had
reasoned of your popish canons.
[$Q.$] Is not the common prayer booke / established by the Queenes
law?
[$L. Cheif Iust.$] Tel vs what yow thinke of the book of common
prayer / yow shal haue libertie to cal back what yow wil againe.
[$A.$] If it were in free conference / as it hath bene often desired
by vs I would so doe.
[$Winch.$] Haue yow not vsed these wordes a yeare a goe / that it
was popish superstitious and idolatrous?
[$A.$] Yes I thinck I haue: for it was taken out of the Popes
portuis.
[$Q.$] Why would yow not answer so before?
[$A.$] Because I see yow goe about to bring me within the compasse
of the law.
[$I. Anderson.$] What say yow now to it?
[$A.$] That ther ar many errors in it / and the forme therof is
disagreeable to the Scriptures.
[$Arch B.$] Is it contrary to the Scriptures.
[$A.$] It must needs be contrary if it be disagreable.
[$Winch.$] Whither hold yow it idolatrous / superstitious and popish?
[$A.$] I haue answered what I thinke of it: I hold it ful of errors /
and the forme therof disagreable to the Scriptures.
[$Q.$] What say yow for mariage: did not yow marie one Boman and his
wife / in the Fleet?
[$A.$] No / neither is mariage a part of the ministers office.
[$Q.$] Who did vse prayer?
[$A.$] I thinke / I did at that time vse prayer.
[$Q.$] Who ioyned their handes togither?
[$A.$] I know no such thing / they did publickly acknowledge their
consent before the assemblie.
[$Stanup.$] I wil make them doe penance for it.
[$A.$] Ther be some had more need shew open repe~tance then they.
[$B.$] They may make such mariages vnder a hedge / and it hath bene a 
long receiued order to be maried by the minister.
[$A.$] No / ther were many faithful witnesses of their consentes:
and if it were not lawful / we haue many examples of the ancient
fathers / who by your iudgement did amisse.
[$Q.$] What say yow to the church of England / is it a true
established church of God?
[$A.$] The whole common wealth is not a church.
[$J. Anders.$] But doe yow know any true established church in the
land?
[$A.$] If I did / I would not accuse them vnto yow.
[$Q.$] But what say yow / is not the whole land as it standeth now
ordered / a true established church?
[$A.$] No / not as the assemblies are generally ordered / if it please
yow / I
<P C2V>
wil shew yow the reasons.
[$L. C. Iust.$] No / yow shal haue ynough hereafter to shew the
reasons / it is not now to be stood upon.
[$Q.$] What doe yow say to the church of England as it is now guided
by Bbs. is it Antichristian?
[$A.$] By such Bs. and lawes as it is now guided / it is not
according to the Scriptures.
[$Winch.$] Thow hast Scriptures often in thy mouth: is it then
Antichristian.
[$A.$] Yea / I hold it contrarie to Christes word.
[$Q.$] What say yow to the Sacramentes then / are they true
Sacramentes?
[$A.$] No / they are neither rightly administred according to Christes
institution / neither haue promise of grace / because yow keep not the
covenant.
[$Q.$] Speak plainly / are they true Sacramentes or no?
[$A.$] No / if yow haue no true church yow can haue no true
Sacramentes.
[$Q.$] How say yow / are we baptised?
[$A.$] Yea / yow haue the outward signe which is the washing / but no
true Sacrament.
[$Q.$] How can that be?
[$A.$] Very wel. [$ (then I thought to haue shewed reasons / but I
could not be suffred.) $]
[$Q.$] Is it lawful Baptisme?
[$A.$] Yea.
[$Q.$] Need we then to be baptised againe if we had that ministerie
and gouerment yow speak of?
[$A.$] No.
[$Q.$] Should we be baptised at al?
[$A.$] Yea / or els if we contemne it / we deny the profession of
grace.
[$Q.$] Doe yow hold it lawful to baptise children?
[$A.$] Yea / I am no Anabaptist I thanke God.
[$Q.$] How far differ yow?
[$A.$] So far as truth from errors.
[$Q.$] Yow haue a boy vnbaptised / how old is he?
[$A.$] A yeare and a halfe.
[$Q.$] What is his name?
[$A.$] Abel.
[$Q.$] Who gaue him that name?
[$A.$] My self / being father.
[$Q.$] Why hath he not bene baptised?
[$A.$] Because that I haue bene in prison / and cannot tel where to
goe to a reformed church / wher I might haue him baptised according
to Gods ordinance.
[$Q.$] Wil yow goe to church to S=t=. Brides?
[$A.$] I know no such church.
[$Q.$] Wil yow goe to Pauls?
[$A.$] No.
[$Q.$] Doe yow not hold a parish / the church?
[$A.$] If al the people were faithful / hauing Gods law and ordnances
practised amongst them / I doe.
[$Q.$] Then yow hold that the parish / doe not make it the church?
[$A.$] No / but the profession which the people make.
[$Q.$] Doe yow hold that the church ought to be governed by a
Presbyterie?
[$A.$] Yea, euery congregation of Christ ought to be gouerned by
that Presbyterie which Christ hath appointed.
[$Q.$] What are those officers?
[$A.$] Pastor / Teacher / Elder / etc.
[$Q.$] And by no other?
[$A.$] No / by no other then Christ hath appointed.
[$Q.$] May this people and presbyterie reforme such thinges as be
amisse / without the Prince?
[$A.$] They ought to practise Gods lawes / and correct vice by the
censure of the word.
[$Q.$] What if the Prince forbid them?
[$A.$] They must doe that which God commaundeth neuerthelesse.
[$Q.$] If the Prince doe offende / whither may the presbyterie
excommunicate the Prince or no?
[$A.$] The whole [^SOURCE TEXT: wole^] church may excommunicate any 
member of that congregation / if the partie continue obstinate in open 
transgression.
<P C3R>
[$Q.$] Whither may the Prince be excommunicate?
[$A.$] Ther is no exception of person: and I doubt not but her
maiestie would be ruled by the word / for it is not the men / but the
word of God which bindeth and looseth sinne.
[$Q.$] Whither may the Prince make lawes in the gouerment of the 
church / or no?
[$A.$] The Scripture hath set downe sufficient lawes for the worship
of God / and gouerment of the church / to which no man may adde or
diminish.
[$Q.$] What say yow to the Princes supremacie / is her maiestie
supreme head of the church: ouer al causes / as wel ecclesiastical as
temporal?
[$A.$] A supreme magistrate ouer al persons to punish the euil and
defend the good.
[$Q.$] Ouer al causes? [$etc.$]
[$A.$] No / Christ is onely head of his church / and his lawes may no
man alter.
[$Q.$] The pope giueth thus much to the Prince.
[$A.$] No / that he doth not / he setteth himself aboue Princes
and exempteth his preisthod from the magestrates sword.
[$Q.$] What say yow to the oath of the Queenes supremacie / wil yow
answer to it?
[$A.$] [^NO SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION IN SOURCE TEXT.^] If these 
ecclesiastical orders be meant such as be agreeable unto the 
scriptures / I wil / for I deny al forreigne power.
[$Q.$] It is meant / the order and goverment with
al the lawes in the church as it is now established.
[$A$] Then I wil not answer to approue therof.
