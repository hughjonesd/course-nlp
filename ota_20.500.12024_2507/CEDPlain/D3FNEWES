   [$In the Country of (^Almaine^) , in a certain
Village, there was on a time a Parson of a
Church which preached unto his Parishioners,
and thereby shewed them the joys of Heaven
and the pains of Hell, and many other things.
And as he thus preached in the Pulpit, among
the people, there was a Miller which knew
well that the Priest had a concubine, and spake
so loud that every body did hear him.$] What
foolish Priest, [$said he,$] thou makest much
babling in the Pulpit, and all thy wit is not worth
a straw: for I have an Asse that is far wiser
than thou art, and thou makest here much ado of
Heaven and Hell, and I may if I will have both
Heaven and Hell at mine own house, winde
and weather at mine own will, and as it pleaseth
me. [$Wherewith the Priest was greatly
displeased, because he disturbed him in his
Sermon, and said he would complain thereof to the
Bishop.$] Well, [$said the Miller,$] if thou dost
complain, I will abide by that which I have said.
[$But as soon as the Priest had done his Sermon,
he went to the Bishop, & complained unto him
of all that which the Miller had formerly
spoken, whereupon the Bishop incontinently sent
<P A2V>
for the Miller, and when the miller came, the
Bishop demanded if he could reasonably
answer the complaint made against him by the
Priest;$] Yea my Lord [$qd. the Miller,$] that I can.
Well, [$said the Bishop,$] thou saidst that thou
mightest have thy choice both of heaven and
hell at home in thine own house, when it
pleaseth thee; and more over thou saidst, thou hadst
both wind and weather at thine own pleasure:
and also thou saidst, thou hast an Ass that is
far wiser than the Parish Priest. If thou
canst prove thy saying true, thou shalt go quit
without danger.
   Indeed, [$qd. the Miller,$] I said, that I had the
choice of heaven and hell at mine own house if I
would, and so I have, for I have a Mother of
mine at home, that is so old that she can neither
go nor stand, and I trust as long as I keep
her well and do her good, I shall by the grace
of God, have heaven at will, and if I do not that
I deserve perpetual damnation: and likewise
I said, that I had both wind and weather at
will, and that is true; for if it be the Lords will
that I have good wind and weather, it is my will
also and I am very well contented therewith: &
if it be his will to send me otherwise, it is my
will also, and I am pleased therewith: & whereas
I said, that I had an Ass that was wiser than
<P A3R>
our Priest, that is most true; for mine Ass
sometime when he stumbleth in a hole as she
goeth she will beware that she come no more
that way, but looketh well before her, and will
take heed that she do fall no more therein; but
this Priest hath had a Maid this seven years and
more, which he lyeth withall, and falleth oft in
her hole, and yet he cannot beware of it. And
thus I hope I have sufficiently answered to
this complaint.
Well [$ (said the Bishop) $] thou hast answered,
& wisely and therefore go thy ways. [^...^]

[} (^ANOTHER.^) }]
   [$There was a Fryer in (^London^) , which did
use to go often to the house of an old woman,
and ever when he came to her house, she hid all
the meat she had. On a time this Fryer came
to her house. (bringing certain company with
him) and demanded of the Wife if she had any
meat. And she said,$] Nay. Well [$quoth the
Fryer,$] have you not a whetstone? Yea [$ (qd. the
Woman) $] what will you do with it? Marry
[$qd he.$] I would make meat thereof. [$Then she
brought a whetstone. He asked her likewise if
<P A3V>
she had not a Frying-pan.$] Yea, [$said she,$] but
what the divil will ye do therewith? Marry
[$ (said the Fryer) $] you shall see by and by what I
will do with it: [$and when he had the pan, he
set it on the fire, and put the whetstone therein.$] 
Cocks body, [$said the woman,$] you will burn the
pan. No, no, [$qd. the Fryer,$] if you will give me
some eggs, it will not burn at all. [$But she
would have had the pan from him, when that
she saw it was in danger; yet he would not let
her, but still urged her to fetch him some eggs,
which she did.$] Tush [$said the Fryer,$] here are not
enow, go fetch ten or twelve. [$So the good Wife
was constrayned to fetch more, for feare lest the
Pan should burn; And when he had them, he put
them in the pan.$] Now [$qd he,$] if you have no
butter, the pan will burn and the eggs too. [$So the
good wife being very loth to have her Pan
burnt, and her eggs lost, she fetcht him a dish of
butter, the which he put into the pan and made
good meat thereof, & brougt it to the table,
saying$] Much good may it do you my Masters, now
may you say, you have eaten of a buttered
Whetstone. [^...^]

[^AN OLD MAN WITH POOR EYESIGHT HAS A YOUNG WIFE.
THE YOUNG WIFE HAS A SERVANT WHO IS ALSO HER LOVER. ONE NIGHT 
THE WIFE TELLS HER SERVANT TO COME INTO HER AND HER HUSBAND'S
BEDROOM AT MIDNIGHT.^]
[^---^] [$but a little before the time prefixed, she
awakned her husband and said thus unto him,$] 
Sir, I will tell you a thing in secret, which
your servant was purposed to do; when I am
alone, I can never be at quiet for him, but he
is always enticeing me to have me at his will,
and so at the last to be quiet with him, I
consented to meet him in the garden, but for mine
honesties sake I will not. Wherefore I pray
you put on my cloathes and go meet him: so
when he comes to you, beat him well, and chide
him, for I know well he will not strike you,
<P A4V>
because you are his Master, and then he may
amend himself & prove a good servant: [^---^]
[^THE HUSBAND GOES OUT TO THE GARDEN. THE SERVANT COMES TO THE WIFE
AND SHE TELLS HIM WHAT SHE HAS SAID TO HER HUSBAND. AFTER A WHILE
THE SERVANT GOES TO THE GARDEN WHERE HE MEETS HIS MASTER.^]
[^---^] [$as though he knew not it was his
Master, & said unto him,$] Nay you whore, I did
this but only to prove thee, whether thou
wouldest be false to my good Master, and not that I
would do such a vile thing with thee. 
[$Whereupon he fell upon his Master, giving him many
sore stripes, and beating him most cruelly, still
calling him nothing but,$] Out you Whore, will
you offer this abuse to my good Master? Alas,
[$ (qd. his Master) $] good (^John^) I am thy Master,
strike me no more, I pray thee. Nay Whore [$ (qd.
he) $] I know who thou art well enough [$and so he
struck him again, beating him most grievously.$] 
Good (^John^) [$ (said his Master) $] feel I have a
beard. [$Then the servant felt (knowing well
who it was) who presently kneeled down, and
<P A5R>
cryed his Master mercy.$] Now thanks be to
God, [$ (qd. his Master) $] I have as good a servant
of thee as a man can have, and I have as good
a wife as the world affords. [$Afterwards the
Master went to bed, and his servant also. When
the old man came to bed to his Wife; she
demanded of him how he sped. He answered and
said,$] By my troth Wife, I have the trustiest
servant in the World, and as faithful a Wife; for
my servant came thither with a great staff,
and did beat me right sore, thinking it had been
you; wherefore I was well pleased therewith.

[^TWO YOUNG PLOUGHMEN HAVE BEEN IN THE CHURCH.^]
[^---^] Lob I pray
thee what was that the Priest went so whinging
whanging withal? Why Dob [$ (qd. the other) $]
dost thou not know? It is Frankincense. Is it
Frankincense? I am sure it stunk as if the 
devil had been in the Church.

   [$There were once too men that were both
masterless and moneyless, & one said to the
other,$] What remedy canst thou now find out
that we may either get some meat or money?
By my troth [$qd, the other) $] I do know a very
fine shift, [$ (& being very early in the morning,
they espyed a man coming with Hogs) $] Lo
yonder cometh a man with Hogs, and I will
tell him that they be sheep, & I will cause him to
lay a wager with me, whether they be Sheep
or hogs: & I will cause the matter to be judged
by the next man that cometh, but then thou
must go another way & meet with us; when we
demand of thee whether they be sheep or hogs,
thou must say that they be sheep. [$Then they
separated themselves the one from the other, 
and the one went to meet the man that had the
Swine, bidding him good morrow; the man
doing the like to him again. Then he said to
the old man$] Father, where had you your fair
sheep; What sheep [$qd. the man;$] These sheep
that you drive before you: Why [$ (qd.) the old man$]
they are Swine. What [$ (qd. the other) $] will you
make me a fool? think you I know not sheep
from Swine? Marry [$ (qd. the old man) $] I will lay
one of my Swine against what thou wilt, that
<P A8R>
they be no Sheep. I hold thee my coat against
one of thy sheep, [$qd. the other.$] I am content, [$qd.
the old man,$] by whom shall we be tryed? By the
next man that meets us. Content, [$said the old
man. And then they perceived the man coming
being the fellow of the young man. And when
he came to them, the old man requested him to
tel them what beasts those were?$] Why [$ (qd. he) $]
they be sheep, do you not know sheep? I told him
so, [$ (qd. the other young man) $] but he would not
believe me, & so I laid my coat upon a Wager
that they were sheep, & he laid one of his sheep
against my Coat that they were Swine: and I
won it, have I not? Yea [$ (qd. the old man) $] but
God help me, I bought them for Swine, [^---^]

[^A BOY FROM THE NORTH IS ASKED TO FETCH THE SALAD (SALLET)
WHICH HE HAS NEVER HEARD OF. HE FINDS A SALLET (A HELMET).^]
[^---^]
[$and said to himself,$] What will my Master do
with this in a platter? [$So down he took it, and
put it into a Platter and put Dil and Vinegar
unto it, and brought it to the table.$] Why thou
knave [$ (qd, his Master) $] I had thee bring the
herbs, which we call a Sallet. Now by my
Sires sale Master [$ (said the boy,) $] I did never see
such in my Country. [^...^]

[^A MAN ASKS A BOY TO FETCH HIM SOME COLEWORTS AND SET THEM
OVER THE FIRE IN HIS CHAMBER: THE BOY DOES NOT KNOW WHAT A COLEWORT IS

[^---^] [$he
asked him for his Coleworts which he bad him
<P B2R>
make ready.$] Marry sir, [$said he$] they be almost
enough for they have lien rosting in the fire
almost this hour. Where are they, [$said the
Master?$] In your chamber sir, [$qd. the boy. So he
went into his chamber and there he saw a great
fire, and then he asked the boy again where the
coleworts were.$] Why Master [$qd the boy$] I
understood you that you bad me fetch coales and
hang them over the fire in the basket, and if I
should have done so the basket would have
burned: wherefore I took the basket and powred
the coals on the fire. O whorson [$qd. his Master,$] I
bad thee to fetch some coleworts and hang them
in a kettle over the fire: [^---^]

   [$In the countrey dwelt a Gentlewoman who
had a French man dwelling with her, and

upon a time he and his Mistresse were going to
Church and she bad him pull the doore after him
and follow her to the Church, and so he took the
doore betweene his armes, and lifted it from the
hooks, and followed his Mistresse with it: But
when she looked behinde her and saw him bring
the doore upon his back,$] Why thou foolish
knave, [$qd. she,$] what wilt thou do with the door?
Mary Mistresse, [$qd. he,$] you bad me pull the doore
after me. Why whorson [$qd. she,$] I did command
thee that thou shouldest make fast the doore
after thee, & not to bring it upon thy back after
me. [^...^]
