[} (^HOW^) HIND (^RUN FROM HIS MASTER^) .}]

   [$Hind living but a weary life with his master, would
often complain to his fellow Apprentize of their (^Slavish^)
life and condition, and told him, (^That it was better to rob on
the highway, then so to spend his life^) , and so resolved to
enlarge his restraint; and upon a time he puts on his (^best
apparel^) and goes to his (^Mother^) and desires leave of her        #
(^privately^) 
(unknown to his (^Father^) ) to go to (^London^) ; and there he told
his (^Mother, he had a friend that in a short time would procure
him a place to his content^) ; the good old woman loving her
(^onely son^) so dearly, (being her onely joy) that she would not
seem to deny him, that request; but gave him (^forty shillings^) , 
and promised to furnish him with no more money, untill such
time as he should be placed; so that now he gives his master
the (^slip^) , and travels towards (^London^) , and upon the Rode he
<P 3>
overtakes some (^Carriers^) , of whom he asked some (^questions^) ,
but they answered him but (^saucily^) , whereupon (^Hind^) strikes
one of them to the ground, but the rest seeing that, fell upon
him, and intreated him with many sower blowes, and at last
being parted, (^Hind^) tells them (^that he would requite their
cowardliness^) ; as afterwards he performed by robbing them,
as shall be intimated hereafter.$]

[} (^WHAT BEFEL HIM WHEN HE CAME TO^) LONDON.}]

   [$Hind being now come to (^London^) , did meet with many
of his friends, and acquaintance, and one night being
(^drinking^) in the (^City^) , and too long staying by the (^good    #
liquor^) ,
made (^Indentures^) as he went by the (^Counter^) , (a (^Trap^) to   #
catch
such (^Rats^) , was forced to take a nap before he went any
further, and after his first (^sleep^) , awaked and looked about him,
saying,$] (^This is a large house and may entertain many guests^) ,
but I do not intend to keep my (^Christmas^) here; [$and 
afterwards meeting with some (^mad Lads^) (as mad as himself) in
earnest resolved to be (^drunk^) , being before but spiced a
little with the same (^disease^) [^SOURCE TEXT: (^dis ase^) ^] , in  #
jest; now they drink and roar,
fearing neither (^Cunstable^) , nor (^Watchmen^) , to come to disturb
them) and at this place (^Hind^) became acquainted with (^Allen^) ,
who now is one of the (^chief Rogues^) in the (^Pack^) and promised
(^Hind^) to entertain him as his servant, and to learn him such an
(^Art^) , as would for ever make him a (^Gentleman^) , (^Hind^) being
willing to imbrace his proffer, (to be a (^Gentleman^) ) vowed,
(^To serve him in any thing^) :$] [^---^]
[^SO HIND BEGAN HIS CAREER, BEING CAREFUL TO PAY HIS NEW MASTER
SPECIAL ATTENTION.^]
<P 4>
[} (^HOW^) ALLEN (^INSTRUCTS HIS NEW SERVANT, AND SETS HIM TO ROB A^)
GENTLEMAN.}]

[^---^] [$ (^Allen^)
seeing his young man in a (^Study^) took him aside, saying,$] (^I
would have you be as my companion and friend, and not as a
servant, neither do I look for any such respect as you do give me;
you shal eat and drink as I do, and if I have money, you shal have
part, and want none, and if I want, you must help to get some
as well as you can^) : [$In short, (^Hind^) condescended, and they
(^swore him to be true to their Gang^) ; which being done, they
admit him as a (^Brother^) of their Company: And now to (^Flesh^)
him they determined, and went to a stable, where were many
brave Horses: (^Allen^) bid him chuse his (^Horse^) , and to take
which he (^liked best^) ; whereupon (^Hind^) did chuse the very best
(and (^Allen^) and his Gang wondred much to see what
an audacious spirit their new Brother had:) Now they go to
(^Shooters-Hill^) , where presently they discovered a 
Gentleman and his servant coming towards them; and (^Allen^) bid
(^Hind^) to ride alone up to them, and they would (^lie^) in an
(^Ambush^) if occasion should serve; thereupon (^Hind^) rides to them
(being already tutor'd to the purpose) and bids them (^Stand,
and deliver such money as they had, otherwise he would
presently be their death^) ; The Gentleman not willing to die,
presently gave him (^Ten pounds^) , which was all the Gentleman had;
(^Hind^) seeing it was all he had, said,$] (^Sir, here is forty      #
shillings
for you to bear your Charges; in regard it is my Handsale^) ; [$the
Gentleman answered,$] (^I wish you better luck with it then I
have^) ; [$so (^Hind^) took his way, and came to the rest of the gang;
<P 5>
and (^Allen^) praised him for learning his Art so quickly, saying,$]
did you not see, (^How he rob'd him with a Grace^) .

[} (^HOW^) HIND (^SOLD HIS HORSE TO A^) CITIZEN (^OF^) LONDON.}]

   [$ (^Hind^) having Liberty to ride where he pleased, having his
Art already so perfectly; upon a time took an occasion to
ride to (^Barnet^) , where he took up his (^Inn^) , and there met with
some Gentlemen, and were very merry together; and after
Supper, (^Hind^) went to (^feed^) his horse, and see him drest, and
some of the Company went with him (but chiefly a (^Citizen^) )
and when they came into the (^Stable^) , the (^Citizen^) looked upon
all the (^Horses^) , wishing, (^he had a better then his own; his
being the worst^) ; and (^switching^) the horses, at last switched   #
(^Hinds^) ,
which leapt with such (^courage^) , as made the young Citizen
wish him (^his own^) ; and asked the Hostler, (^whose horse it was^) ;
the Hostler answered,$] (^it is the Gentlemans in the gray suit^) .
(^I wish he would sel him me^) , [$said the Citizen; In the interim,
(^Hind^) came into the Stable where the Citizen and the Hostler
were; The Hostler said,$] (^Sir, will you sell your horse^) :        #
[$ (^Hind^)
said, (^that money would buy him^) ;$] Sir, [$said the Citizen,$]    #
(^I have a
good Gelding here, but that he is out of flesh; what shal I
give you, and my Gelding, for your Horse^) , [$Hind said,$] (^Sir, you
shal give me five and twenty pound and your Gelding^) ; [$The
Citizen told him it was too much;$] (^yet^) [$said he,$] (^I will    #
give you^) 20l.
(^in Gold and my gelding, which is worth^) 8l. (^for your horse^) :  #
[$Now
he strikes him earnest with a piece of gold, (^Hind^) loving that
(^kind^) of money, yeilded that a bargain; the Citizen had the
best bargain, if he could have kept the horse; though he
bought him by (^Candle light^) : The Citizen pays (^Hind^) the rest 
of the gold, and gives him a pottle of sack for good luck; 
after their mirth they go to bed. In the morning, (^Hind^) , out
of courtesy, would have the Citizen on his way; but as they
rod, (^Hind^) found fault that he rayned his horse too hard, saying,$]
(^he is tender mouthed, and you will put him quite out of his pace^) :
[$But they now riding in (^Endfield Chase^) , (^Hind^) desired the
Citizen to let him ride the horse, and he would shew him how
<P 6>
to pace him right; the Citizen easily believing what (^Hind^) said,
alighted, and mounted the horse that (^Hind^) rid; (^Hind^)
finding himself well setled on his own horse, paced him a little
way;$] Sir, [$said (^Hind^) ,$] (^you shall see his true pace the next 
time you see me^) ; [^---^]
[^SO THE CITIZEN LOST HIS GOLD AND HIS NEW HORSE, AND WHEN 
HE LATER TOLD HIS FRIENDS OF HIS ENCOUNTER, HE WAS GREATLY
RIDICULED.^] 
[^...^] [$The Citizen said,$] 
(^Gentlemen, forbear, for this is worse then the loss of all, to be
laughed at^) .

SPURRED HIM AND HIS GANG TO JOIN IN HIS MANY VARIED EXPLOITS.^]
<P 7>
[} (^HOW^) HIND (^PARTED FROM HIS COMPANY, AND APPOINTED TO MEET THEM
AT A CERTAIN PLACE; AND HOW HE ROBBED TWO GENTLEMENS 
SERVANTS; AND CAUSED A PARSON TO BE APPREHENDED FOR A
HIGHWAY-MAN, AND ESCAPED HIMSELF^) :}]

   [$ (^Hind^) being informed of a Purchase, desired leave of his
gang, to go by himself for a day, and appointed them
to meet him at a certain place; but his plot failed: and
being vext, he not much minded his way, but rod on another
road, where he espied some gentlemen drinking at an
Alehouse on horse-back, having sent their servants before: (^Hind^)
passed by them; but riding at a good rate, quickly overtook
the Gentlemens servants, who rod but easily: (^Hind^) being with
them, saw by their Portmantles that there was money in them;
(^bid deliver the money, or he would be their death^) : they being
not used to fight, yeilded unto him; but he seeing their
delaies would breed danger; with his dagger-knife, cut open
the Portmantles, and took out the money, and tying the baggs
together, laid them before him and rid full speed away: one
of the servants rod to acquaint their Master, who presently
persued (^Hind^) hard: (^Hind^) met a Parson and said to him,$]      #
(^Sir^) ,
I am like to be robbed, you must stand to it now for your own
good as well as mine: they would have this money from me, which
you see. Come Sir, be of good cheer, one honest man will skare
ten theeves: you shall have one of my pistols: [$So (^Hind^) gives the
Parson a pistol ready cock't and charged, and bids him$] fire at
them that come first; while I ride down to the (^next Village
and raise the Countrey people to be our help^) . [$The (^Parson^) 
having taken a cup too much at a wedding, was                        #
(^ (\pot-valliant\) ^) , and
rid up boldly to the Gentlemen, and fired his Pistol at them;
<P 8>
but being too far off, did no execution [^SOURCE TEXT: execntion^]   #
to either of them; but
he rid nigher to them, and flung the (^Pistol^) at one of them, that
he had like to have knockt him off his horse: the Gentlemen
seise on him, and take him prisoner: the Parson cries out,$]
(^spare my life, and you shall have all my money^) : no Sirra, [$said
the Gentlemen,$] (^we will have you hanged: what? a Parson
and rob on the high-way^) : [$they presently hale him to the next
Justice of the Peace, which was very near: when they came
before the Justice, they told him, (^That they were robbed of
almost two hundred pounds; and that this Parson was one of the 
Theeves^) : the Justice marvailed that such an apparent 
testimony should come against the Parson of his Parish.$]
   [$The Parson by this time was come to himself, and desired
the Justice to give him leave to speak for himself: being
licensed to speak, he said to the Justice,$] (^Sir, you have known me
this twenty years, and no man can say I have wronged him of
a penny; much less this which is laid to my charge^) ; Sir, I shall
tell you so much as I know of this business: (^as I was riding in
my way home, I met a man who had two baggs of money before
him, who told me that theeves persued him, and he desired
my help; and said that I need not fear, for One honest man would
beat Ten theeves: so he gave me a Pistol charged, cockt and
primed, and bid me fire at the first that came, while he raised
the Countrey men to assist us^) : but when these Gentlemen
came down the hill, I rod up to them, and fired my pistol
among them, and when I had so done, I flung it at this
Gentlemans head, thinking they had been theeves: (^Sir, this is
all I know of the matter^) . [$The Justice laughed to see the
Parson of his Parish apprehended for a high-way-man; so the
Justice past his word for his appearance the next Assises: who
when he was brought before the Bench, was cleared: But (^he 
made a vow never to fire Pistols more^) .$] 
<P 9>
[} (^HOW^) HIND (^CAME TO HIS COMPANY SHEWING THEM THE MONEY; AND
WHAT HAPNED TO THEM AT THE SAME TIME^) .}]
[^HIND SOUGHT OUT HIS FRIENDS TO TELL THEM OF HIS MOST RECENT 
ADVENTURE, BUT WAS OVERHEARD.^]
[^---^] [$ (^Hind^) having a quick wit, did guess by the peoples
(^staring^) up to the windowes, that they were discovered: he
then speaks to all his Company to shift for themselves: he
takes one of his bags and goes into the stable: and mounts
his horse, and was gone before any of the other could finde
their cloaks and necessaries to be going: there came in this
mean time many people in, who filled the yard with noise, that
they could scarce hear one another: (^Allen^) to appease the
multitude, flung handfuls of money among them: saying,$]
(^Good people forbear comming any farther^) , and be civil: for
we are Gentlemen: and to the contrary expect death some of
you: [^---^]
[^ALLEN AND HIS MEN MANAGE TO ESCAPE TO AN INN SOME TWENTY MILES
AWAY. HOWEVER, A CONSTABLE COMES UPON THE INN WHILE THEY ARE

<P 10>
[^---^] [$ (^Allen^) was amased to see so many
lights, and watchbills, in his Chamber, said Mr. Counstable,$]
(^You might have been more civil, then to press into my Chamber
at this time of the night^) : Sir, [$said the Counstable$] I was
commanded so to do: (^I would your torches and candles were all
out^) , [$said Allen,$] (^otherwise I shall not sleep^) :            #
(^Jack^) : give the
Counstable five shilings to make his watchmen drink: I thank
you sir [$said the Counstable,$] (^I see you are an honest Gentleman
now: Good night sir: Good night Mr. Counstable: I pray
let me hear no more of you^) .
   [$The Counstable descending the stairs; said to some of his
watchmen,$] I am sorry I have troubled the Gentleman: did
you not see what a glorious shute lay on the Table: I'll
warrant it (^cost twenty Nobles, at least^) : his men I beleeve are  #
all
(^Gentlemen^) or (^Gentlemens sons^) ; good lord! If I had taken
these men for the Robbers, What should have become of me,
and you too: [$one of (^Allens^) men came down and called for a
pint of Sack in a Gallon pot: the Counstable drank Sack like
small Beer, till the watchmen were troubled to carry him, for
go he could not; so we leave the Counstable drunk as he is:
and return to (^Allen^) : who is in a (^sweat^) .$]

DRINK, FEARING LEAST A PLOT SHOULD BE LAID TO TAKE HIM: AND
HOW IN THE MORNING HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED A^) STEWARD (^TO A
NOBLE MAN^) .}] 

   [$When (^Allen's^) men came from the (^Counstable^) , he said
to them,$] (^How goes the squares abroad^) : [$they answer
him$] very well: (^feel my hands^) [$ (^said^) Allen,$] (^If I was   #
not in a
fear when they came^) : well we are much bound to God that he
gave this (^Counstable^) no more understanding; otherwise we
might have lookt out at a grate by this time; I hope that
(^James^) is well, for I love him dearly; Gentlemen, I shall desire
you to sit up this night for fear of the worst: [$so (^Allen^) made  #
as
<P 11>
though that disturbance would not let him sleep any more
that night: saying,$] (^When my first sleep is broke, I can sleep no
longer^) : [$so he sends one of his servants to the Host of the
house to come and drink with him: who being a good fellow,
never denies drink, came willingly to Mr. (^Allen^) : (who told
him, he was sorry there was any disturbance in the house; but
being in all other Inns, he hoped he would not be
offended:$] No, no, [$said (^Allen^) ,$] (^I am not troubled^) , but #
onely for my
sleep: but this shall be your penalty that you drink all
night with me; sir, [$said the Host,$] I shall fulfil your desire:
[$then said (^Allen^) $] I will rise; [$there being a great fire in  #
the
room: their drink was muld sack till morning: which when it
appeared he caused all his men to be in a readiness for to take
horse; and accordingly his desire was accomplished, so
taking leave of his Host, rod away: but riding by-ways because of
the hew and cryes overtook a Gentleman riding with a
port mantle behinde him: (^Allen^) used some discourse; and
among the rest asked if he lived thereabouts: he answered$] yes,
I am a steward to a noble man in these parts, and I have been
to fetch in some rents that lay forty miles off: [$ (^Allen^) was glad
when he heard he had money: said,$] sir, how do you think I
maintain all these Gentlemen: shall I tell you: (^I borrow of
those that are not willing to give or to lend^) : sir, [$said the
Steward$] you are merrily disposed: and are willing to try my
patience: I speak in earnest [$said (^Allen^) ,$] therefore unto your
portmantle: sir, [$said the Steward,$] if you will have it, I cannot
now gainsay it: I am a servant, and if you take this money
from me I am undon; but I will direct you to a greater
purchase if you let me escape: [$to this (^Allen^) consented:$]      #

his horse^) .
[$They quickly made themselves ready, and rod after (^Hind^) ;
when they had overtaken him, they asked him which way he
rod, he answers them,$] towards (^Cambridg^) : [$they tell him they
would be glad of his company: now riding in a place where no
people were nigh, one of the theeves sings$] (^Maids where are
your hearts become, Look you what here is^) ! [$ (^Hind^) seeing their
intent, and knowing he was betrayed, answers them in the same
tune:$] (^Now you Rogues, you are both undone Look you what
here is^) , [$fyring at one of them, by chance shot his horse in the
head: the horse presently fell down with his Masters leg
under him: the other seeing this, betook him self to flight, but
(^Hind^) quickly overtook him, and made him deliver such money
as he had: cutting his girts and his bridle made him work
enough to catch his horse again. (^Hind^) now rides to the other
theif who now lay in little ease: he alights and puls the horse
from his leg, and then helps him up, and takes away his money
also, saying,$] (^is there but one Master-Thief in^) England, (^and
would you venture to rob him: verily, were you not of mine
own profession; neither of you should have lived; but seeing
you ventured hard for it, thou deservest something^) : [$so (^Hind^)
gave him his money back which he had taken from him, to
buy him another horse: saying to him,$] (^Remember what I say
unto you: Disgrace not your selves with small sums, but aim
high, and for great ones; for the least will bring you to the

away by bulging on rocks that are neer the shore; those that
can swim may be saved, but those that cannot must take their
fortune. Even so it is with you: For friends that should stir
in your business, I have none; and that which should do you
most good, doth you the most injury: I shall desire you
upon my blessing to bridle your speech, and let not envy be in
your heart to any one: let not this counsel be like water spilt
upon the ground, but make use of it for the best.
   (^Father^) , I shall by the help of God follow your advice:
and I desire the world not to look back on my actions; but
forward, and they shall find me an altered man.
   (^Husband^) , I would once more you were at liberty, that I
might see this change, which would make both soul and 
body happy.
   [$The Keeper having occasion to be gone, desired them to
depart for that time: so taking their leave of him, they went to

[} (^THE TRYAL OF CAPTAIN^) JAMES HIND, (^IN THE^) OLD BAYLEY (^WITH
HIS EXAMINATION, AND CONFESSION^) .}]

   [$On (^Friday^) the 12. of (^December^) 1651: About two of
the Clock in the afternoon, Captain (^James Hind^) was
brought to the Bar, before the Honourable Court at the
Sessions in the (^Old Bayly^) : being brought with four Keepers to
the Bar: divers Questions were proposed to him, which he
very mildly answered: the Recorder asked him, what
(^Countryman he was, and where he was born^) : He replyed,$] (^at the
merry Town of Chipping-Norton in Oxfordshire^) : [$then it was 
demanded of him, (^whether he accompanied the^) Scotish King
(^into^) England; (^and whether he was at the fight at^) Worcester:
He answered, (^that he came into^) England (^with his Majesty the
King; and that he was not onely at the fight at^) Worcester,
(^but at^) Warrington (^also, wishing that it had been his happy
fortune there to have ended his daies^) .$]
   [$Then some farther questions were proposed to him, in
relation to his (^Mad Pranks^) : To which he answered, (^that what
he confessed before the Councel of State, the like he
acknowledged to that Honorable Court^) : protesting his innocency in
any matter of Fact or Crime, since the year 1649. within
any of the Parliaments Dominions. He stands indited upon
high Treason, by the Councel of State, and thereupon the
Court made no farther progress against him; by reason that
no bill of inditement was brought in; so he was ordered to
be remanded back to the place from whence he was brought:
The time he was at the Bar, he deported himself with
undaunted courage, yet with a smiling Countenance: but
before his departure, this is observable; that as he passed from
the Bar, casting his head on one side, and looking as it were
over the left shoulder: said,$] (^these are filthy gingling spurs^) ;
[$ (meaning his irons about his legs) $] (^but I hope to have them
exchanged ere long^) ; [$which expression caused much laughter. As
he passed up the (^Old Bayley^) towards (^Newgate^) , divers people
resorted to see him; who asked if he had received sentence:
which words Captain (^Hind^) hearing, faced to the left, and
<P 45>
smiling, said,$] (^no, no, good people, there is no hast to hang
true folk^) .

   [$Being now come to (^Newgate^) , many Gentlemen were
there to see him, and to ask him some questions:
Captain (^Hind^) having a little time now more then ordinary, before
he went to his old lodging: said,$] Gentlemen, (^what is your
will with me, I know you long to hear news^) : [$they desired to
know how he came off at the Sessions: he pulling a chair, said,$]
(^I stand but in little ease therefore I will first sit down^) :     #
[$then
calling for a glass of Sack drank to them all, saying,$] Gentlemen,
(^I was somewhat dry with talking: therefore give me the other
glass^) : [$having drank his Sack, said,$] Gentlemen, (^It seems that
to my enemies I have been civil^) ; there being no bill found
against me, the Honorable Court onely asked my name, and
some other questions; which I answered, not seeing any one
that would accuse me: neither could I spy, no, not so much,
as the face of a Thief catcher; ( (^who would if they knew how^)
(not for their conscience sake; nor out of love to the
Common-wealth) (^Hang me^) ) but for the lucre of the ten pounds
which is the reward; which will make them swallow a false
oath as easily, (^as one would do buttered fish^) : but I have
nothing to do with them, nor never had; so I leave them to
follow the rest of their Company, which assoon as they have
oppertunity, will let no time slip to help one another to the
Gallowes. [$His Father and his Wife came into the Room, which
broke of his discourse: so for the present taking his leave of
the Gentlemen, went with his Father into his own Room,
where he lay; being by themselves, his Father said to him,$]
Son; (^How much are you bound to God for your good fortune,
you see many poor men here condemned, who have not been so
noted as you have been, I make no doubt but God has a blessing
in store for you; and it is my desire as a Father to see his child do
well: So I hope thou will not forget my Councel, but daily
meditate on things for thy Soul, and then thou shalt be happy^) .
   [$His Wife then rejoycing to see him take his imprisonment
so patiently: said$] (^Dear heart, I shall visit you often, but it is
<P 46>
my grief that I come to a Prison to you; but I hope you shall be
released of your misery, and live once more with me^) : [$His
Father said,$] Son, (^my occasion calls me home, and I shall do you
little good in staying here; I shall take my leave of you^) : [$now
giving him his blessing, bids him (^fare-wel^) ; wishing him to
serve God, who would not cast away a sinner that doth truly
repent: His Wife with tears in her eies gave him a parting 
Salute; which made the stout Captain answer the same in the 
like nature; wishing he were at liberty to have gone with
them: but he still relying on the mercy of the Parliament;
made no doubt, but to visit his friends, before they came to
visit him again; but as yet he lies in (^Newgate^) in hopes of a
Release.$]
