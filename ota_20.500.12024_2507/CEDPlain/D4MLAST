[}THE SUBSTANCE OF THE LAST WORDS AND CONFESSIONS OF (^SUSANNA
EDWARDS^) , (^TEMPERANCE LLOYD^) , AND (^MARY TREMBLES^) , AT THE
TIME AND PLACE OF THEIR EXECUTION; AS FULLY AS COULD BE
TAKEN IN A CASE LIABLE TO SO MUCH NOISE AND CONFUSION, AS
IS USUAL ON SUCH OCCASSIONS.}]

   [$Mr. (^H.^) $] (^Mary Trembles^) , What have you to say as to    #
the Crime
you are now to die for?
   [$ (^Mary.^) $] I have spoke as much as I can speak already, and  #
can
speak no more.
   [$ (^H.^) $] In what shape did the Devil come to you?
   [$ (^Mary.^) $] The Devil came to me once, I think, like a Lyon.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Did he offer any violence to you?
<P 38>
   [$ (^Mary.^) $] No, not at all, but did frighten me, and did      #
nothing to me:
And I cried to God, and asked what he would have, and he vanished.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Did he give thee any Gift, or didst thou make him any
Promise? [$ (^Mary.^) $] No.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Had he any of thy bloud? [$ (^Mary.^) $] No.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Did he come to make use of thy Body in a carnal      #
manner?
   [$ (^Mary.^) $] Never in my life.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Have you a Teat in your Privy-parts?
   [$ (^Mary.^) $] None. [$ (^The Grand Inquest said it was sworn to #
them.^) $]
   [$ (^H.^) $] (^Mary Trembles^) , Was not the Devil there with     #
(^Susan^) when I
was once in the Prison with you, and under her Coats? the other
told me that he was there, but is now fled; and that the Devil was
in the way when I was going to (^Taunton^) with my Son who is a
Minister. Thou speakest now as a dying Woman, and as the
Psalmist says, (^I will confess my iniquities and acknowledge all my #
sin^) . We
find that (^Mary Magdalen^) had seven Devils, and she came to Christ
and obtained Mercy: And if thou break thy League with the Devil,
and make a Covenant with God, thou mayst also obtain Mercy. If
thou hast any thing to speak, speak thy mind.
   [$ (^Mary.^) $] I have spoke the very truth, and can speak no more:
Mr. (^H.^) I would desire they may come by me, and Confess as I have
done.
   [$ (^H.^) $] (^Temperance Lloyd^) , Have you made any Contract    #
with the
Devil? [$ (^Temp.^) $] No.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Did he ever take any of thy bloud? [$ (^Temp.^) $] No.
   [$ (^H.^) $] How did he appear to thee first, or where in the     #
street? in
what shape? [$ (^Temp.^) $] In a woful shape.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Had he ever any carnal knowledge of thee?            #
[$ (^Temp.^) $] No, never.
   [$ (^H.^) $] What did he do when he came to thee?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] He caused me to go and do harm.
   [$ (^H.^) $] And did you go?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] I did hurt a Woman sore against my Conscience: he
carried me up to her door, which was open: The Womans name was
Mrs. (^Grace Thomas^) .
   [$ (^H.^) $] What caused you to do her harm? what malice had you
against her? did she do you any harm?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] No, she never did me any harm: but the Devil beat #
me
about the Head grievously because I would not kill her: but I did
bruise her after this fashion [$ (^laying her two Hands to her       #
Sides^) .$]
   [$ (^H.^) $] Did you bruise her till the bloud came out of her    #
Mouth
and Nose? [$ (^Temp.^) $] No.
<P 39>
   [$ (^H.^) $] How many did you destroy and hurt? [$ (^Temp.^) $]   #
None but she.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Did you know any Marriners that you or your Associates
destroyed by overturning of Ships and Boats?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] No; I never hurt any Ship, Bark, or Boat in my    #
life.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Was it you or (^Susan^) that did bewitch the Children?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] I sold Apples, and the Child took an Apple from   #
me, and
the Mother took the Apple from the Child; for the which I was
very angry: but the Child died of the Small Pox.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Do you know one Mr. (^Lutteril^) about these parts,  #
or any of
your Confederates? did you or them bewitch his Child?                #
[$ (^Temp.^) $] No.
   [$ (^H.^) $] (^Temperance^) , How did you come in to hurt Mrs.    #
(^Grace 
Thomas^) ? did you pass through the Key-hole of the Door, or was the
Door open?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] The Devil did lead me up Stairs, and the Door was #
open:
and this is all the hurt I did.
   [$ (^H.^) $] How do you know it was the Devil?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] I knew it by his Eyes?
   [$ (^H.^) $] Had you no Discourse or Treaty with him?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] No; he said I should go along with him to destroy #
a
woman, and I told him I would not: he said he would make me;
and then the Devil beat me about the Head.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Why had you not called upon God?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] He would not let me do it.
   [$ (^H.^) $] You say you never hurted Ships nor Boats; did you    #
never
ride over an Arm of the Sea on a Cow?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] No, no, Master, 'twas she, [$ (^meaning^) Susan.$]
   [$When (^Temperance^) said 'twas (^Susan^) , she said she lied,   #
and that she
was the cause of her bringing to die:$] for she said when she was
first brought to Goal, if that she was hanged, she would have me
hanged too; she reported I should ride on a Cow before her, which
I never did.
   [$ (^H.^) $] (^Susan^) , Did you see the shape of a Bullock? at   #
the first time
of your Examination you said it was like a short black man, about
the length of your [^SOURCE TEXT: you^] Arm. [$ (^Sus.^) $] He was   #
black, Sir.
   [$ (^H.^) $] (^Susan^) , Had you any knowledge of the bewitching  #
of Mr.
(^Lutteril's^) Child, or did you know a place called (^Tranton       #
Burroughs^) ?
   [$ (^Sus.^) $] No.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Are you willing to have any Prayers?
   [$Then Mr. (^H.^) prayed, whose Prayer we could not take; and they
sung part of the 40 Psalm, at the desire of (^Susanna Edwards^) : As
<P 40>
she mounted the Ladder, she said,$] (^The Lord Jesus speed me; though
my sins be as red as Scarlet; the Lord Jesus can make them as white as
Snow: The Lord help my Soul^) . [$Then was executed.$]
   [$ (^Mary Trembles^) said,$] (^Lord Jesus receive my Soul; Lord   #
Jesus
speed me^) ; [$and then was also executed.$]
   [$ (^Temperance Lloyd^) said,$] (^Jesus Christ speed me well:     #
Lord forgive all
my sins; Lord Jesus Christ be merciful to my poor Soul^) .
   [$Mr. (^Sheriff.^) $] You are lookt on as the woman that has      #
debaucht the
other two: Did you ever lie with Devils? [$ (^Temp.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] Did not you know of their coming to Goal?           #
[$ (^Temp.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] Have you any thing to say to satisfie the world?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] I forgive them, as I desire the Lord Jesus Christ #
will
forgive me. The greatest thing I did was to Mrs. (^Grace Thomas^) ;
and I desire I may be sensible of it, and that the Lord Jesus Christ
may forgive me. The Devil met me in the street, and bid me kill
her; and because I would not, he beat me about the head and back.
   [$Mr. (^Sh.^) $] In what Shape or Colour was he?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] In black, like a Bullock.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] How do you know you did it? how went you in, through
the Key-hole, or the Door? [$ (^Temp.^) $] At the Door.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] Had you no discourse with the Devil?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] Never but this day six weeks.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] You were charged about 12 years since, and did you  #
never
see the Devil but this time?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] Yes, once before: I was going for Brooms, and he  #
came
to me and said, (^This poor woman has a great burthen^) ; and would  #
help
ease me of my Burthen: and I said, (^The Lord had enabled me to
carry it so far, and I hope I shall be able to carry it further^) .
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] Did the Devil never promise you any thing?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] No, never.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] Then you have served a very bad Master, who gave you
nothing. Well, consider you are just departing this world: do you
believe there is a God? [$ (^Temp.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
   [$ (^Temp.^) $] Yes; and I pray Jesus Christ to pardon all my     #
sins. [$And
so was Executed.$]
