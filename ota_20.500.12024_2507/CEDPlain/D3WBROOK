[}THE
DEPOSITIONS
OF
CAPTAIN BURY.}]

On the (^11th^) of this instant (^January^) , I received the
annexed Note from Mr. (^James Nettervile^) ; on the
(^13th^) I went to him; as soon as I came, he told me,
he had something to impart to me in private; we
went into a Room alone, and he asked me if I did not hear that
there were persons making inquiry to find out some that would
amuse those that had impeached the Lords, and those concerned
about the Plot. I told him I heard nothing of it. He told me
there were such, and that I should find the Game would turn
another way; and that I might do my self a kindness, if I pleased.
I told him my affairs called me for (^Ireland^) , that I must be gone
on the (^Thursday^) following. He told me it would be worth my
while to stay, and asked me if I could not prove that one
Mr. (^Digby^) had meetings with Mr. (^Oates^) , and Mr. (^Bedlow^) . I
told him no, for he knew there had been no great friendship of
late betwixt us (this I look't upon as an Introduction to the
design); but he came close to me, and told me, a person had been
with him concerning this matter, and that indeed they had a
jealousie of Mr. (^Blood^) ; and if I would discover any thing of
that nature against him, I should have 4 or 500 (^l.^) for my pains.
To this I seemed to hearken (but was much surprized at this
unexpected discourse), and did plainly see their design was to
turn the Game another way, as he said before. I did not
discourage him, but told him I would consider of it; and if I did
not go on (^Thursday^) , I would see him again; and that he knew
well I was very hard to believe this Plot; and then he told me
<P 2>
that he could bring a Prisoner in that place to drink a Pot of Ale
with me, that could give me an account what a Rogue Mr.
(^Bedlow^) was; but I being in haste, took my leave of him, he
injoyning me to secresie. At my return I could not meet with
Mr. (^Blood^) , but having some business with Sir (^Ralph Dalaval^) ,
and the Lady (^Elizabeth^) his Daughter, and being full with this
Devilish design, I told the story to them, and said, When I was
in (^Ireland^) , I should hear, and they should find that this was the
Game they intended to play, To turn the Plot from themselves,
and doubted not they would find some to carry it on.
   On the (^14th^) (in the morning) I went to Mr. (^Bloods^) house,
and acquainted him with it; he desired me to meet him in the
evening, because he desired to consider of it; but told me then,
he had no reason to slight it, because the morning before, a Knight
[$ (Sir (^Thomas Lougvile^) ) $] had been with him, and told him there
was a design against him of the same kind, and desired him to
inquire after it.
   In the evening I met with Mr. (^Blood^) , who desired me to keep
my Correspondence with the said (^Nettervile^) , and to know of
him how I should be secured my payments, and what it was 
they would have me do.
   On the (^16th^) I went accordingly to him, and told him I had
considered of what we had discoursed before, and had stopt my
Journey as to that day; he was very glad to see me, and told
me, that the party [$ ( (^Russel^) ) $] had been with him again      #
about the
business, and I might get 500 (^l.^) without any prejudice to my
self; I told him that Money would do me a great kindness at
this time (for he knew I had waited a long time here, and
that it was very hard with me), therefore desired to know what
they would have me to do, and how I should be sure of the
500 (^l.^) for I expected it should be a person of good credit that
would lay down the 500 (^l.^) he told me I should not need to
question that, for they were of credit enough. But he that
came to him [$ ( (^Russel^) ) ,$] was only imployed to pay the Money;
and if I shall tell him that you will do the business, you shall
be sure of the Money; not so, said I, First let me know what
it is distinctly, and how I shall be sure of the 500 (^l.^) or else I
will not stir a foot in it, but be gone on (^Monday^) . Saith he,
Would you have the Money before-hand? then it may be
you will not do it. No, said I, that I do not desire. But will
you deposite it in a third hand? Truly, said he, that is very fair,
and (^I^) doubt not but they will do it (for (^I^) told him none was
<P 3>
better able to carry it on than you; for Mr. (^Bloods^) Man was
formerly your Servant, and preferred by you to him), and told
me, that on (^Saturday^) , by two or three of the Clock, his friend
would be with him again; but that he would be shy of
discoursing with me; and desired that (^I^) would come to him
[$ ( (^Russel^) ) $] on (^Monday^) , and then (^I^) should           #
understand more. Upon
my return I acquainted Mr. (^Blood^) with the whole discourse, and
that I was to leave the Town on (^Monday^) , having stayed my
utmost time, because I had a Suit depending in Chancery, at
(^Dublin^) ; and that if I were not there the beginning of the       #
(^Term^) ,
it would be great damage to me, because my absence would
be looked upon as a Contempt; but Mr. (^Blood^) requested
me to stay until he had acquainted His Majesty, or one of his
Secretaries with it, to know his pleasure as to my going, or
stay.

   [$Sworn before me the (^17th^) of
(^Jan.^) 1678. (^J. Williamson^) .$] [$ (^John Bury.^) $]

(^Saturday^) the (^18th^) day of (^January^) , I was with (^James    #
Nettervile^) 
in the Evening; he told me his friend [$ ( (^Russel^) ) $] had left  #
him
about half an hour before I came, and that he acquainted him
with what I propounded (to wit) that 500 (^l.^) should be
deposited in a third persons hand; and he told me his friend was
contented it should be so, and thought it but reasonable, and
therefore was willing to put it into a Goldsmiths hand. I asked
him if they had considered the method we should carry this on?
and whether they had drawn up the Heads of what I was to
swear? He told me, no; but his friend would be with him
again upon (^Wednesday^) , and that all things should be prepared
and ready for me by (^Thursday^) morning. I asked him if it would
be convenient for me to meet his friend? he told me not as yet,
for he was very wary, shy, and fearful of being betrayed. I told
him I thought my meeting with him was not material; only, said
I, let him be sure to secure the Money, and he needs not doubt
of effecting the business: But, said I, 500 (^l.^) is not all that I
expect from him for this service, that is but a melting Cash,
and I have a great charge, and a Wife and six Children, and
you know I have lyen a longer time waiting here, almost to
my utter ruin, and have been very hardly dealt with. Now,
if I accomplish this, I shall lose my interest in all other Parties,
and therefore expect he should make me a very good interest
<P 4>
with that Party. Never fear that, said he, you shall have
interest enough with them; and if we can but turn off this Plot,
there is no danger of effecting our business; for, saith he, the
King will believe nothing of it. Well, said I, I must trust to
you to make my interest; but I partly see how things are like to
go, and think it wisdom to come in with the beginning of the
Game. Saith he (Swearing by his Maker) Never fear, if we
turn off this Plot, we do our business, and you will be made for
ever. But, said I, Why will you defer this while (^Wednesday^) ?
That is a great while, and delays are not good. Said he, I did not
expect you till (^Sunday^) : But if (^I^) hear any thing in the mean
time, (^I^) will write to you, and it shall be left at Mr.           #
(^Brookes's^)
Lodging. I hear, said I, the Parliament is Prorogued; and that
is true enough, said he; and till they meet again, we can
receive no great damage: But, said he, I hear the Apprentices are
ready to rise and pull down (^Newgate^) . Said I, then I suppose that
is, because the men [$ ( (^Jesuits^) ) $] are not executed; What else,
said he? and that is our great danger, that the people should
run into a Rebellion before we accomplish our business: I asked
him if he had taken an Abstract, as he said he would, of what
that man in the Prison could Swear, to take off Mr. (^Bedlow's^)
Evidence; I have not yet, said he, but we are sure enough of 
him, and shall make (^Bedlow^) Rogue enough. Pray, said I, what
will he Swear? That the very morning the Proclamation came
forth concerning Sir (^Edmondbury Godfrey^) , Mr. (^Bedlow^) came to
his Chamber, and asked him if he had ever seen Sir 
(^Edmondbury Godfrey^) ; For, said he, if I knew what a like man he  #
was, 
I could easily get 500 (^l.^) and however, I am resolved to hazard my 
Neck, but I will have it; and that he would have had this man
go with him to (^Somersethouse^) to see the Rooms, and promised
to get him Money, if he would go with him. But, said I,
Mr. (^Nettervile^) , it is said Mr. (^Bedlow^) was out of Town before
the Proclamation came out; that is not so, saith he, for this
mans Wife went into the Countrey with him. A great deal
of discourse more we had, all tending to the incouraging of me
to carry on this business, to turn this Plot to be a (^Protestant    #
Plot^)
for the destruction of the (^Papists^) , and then I should be made
for ever. When I paid the Reckoning, and was coming away,
said he, you will always come to your charge, but I hope the
end will pay for all.
<P 5>
   On (^Wednesday^) the (^22d^) , at Night, I went to Mr.            #
(^Nettervile^) ,
expecting to have the Moddel how they would have me Swear,
and in what Goldsmiths hand they would put the 500 (^l.^) But
as soon as ever I came to him, he told me that he had been put
into such a fright, that he was never in all his life before; for,
said he, Mr. (^Oates^) , Mr. (^Bedlow^) , Sir (^William Waller^) ,   #
and another
Justice have been with me; they called for Irons, one would
have fifty pound weight, another would have an hundred pound
weight put upon me. At length Sir (^William Waller^) began to
examine me, and told me, he knew I could discover a great deal;
for I desired the rest might be put out of the room, and I
confest all to him and the other Justice, they both promising me
my pardon. Have you confest all, said I? how could I help
it, said he? I was never in such a fright in all my life; and they
promised me my pardon. What have you confest, said I? I have
told them, said he, That 500 (^l.^) was to be deposited in a
Goldsmiths hand, and that I had sent for a Gentleman, and treated
with him about it. Have you told them my name, said I? He
paused at that; No, said he; but I must tell them, but I
thought first to acquaint you with it. Then said I, it seems you
have left me in the lurch, and have made no provision for me;
therefore since it is so, you will give me leave to play my own
Game; and seeing you have confest, let us now play our Game
as well as we can on the other side, and be sure to be
ingenuous, and confess whatever we know. I will immediately to Sir
(^Joseph Williamson^) , and declare the whole Story. Pray do so,
saith he, neglect no time, but go this night. And so we parted.

[} (^THE DEPOSITION OF ALDERMAN^) BROOKS.}]

[$That$] on or about the (^23d^) of (^December^) , 1678, I was
at the (^Marshalseys^) in (^Southwark^) , where was one (^James
Nettervile^) , a prisoner there for debt; who desired me to
do so much for him, as to carry a Note for a friend of his that
was a prisoner also, unto one (^Pierce Butler^) , that lived in
(^Germanstreet^) , near my Lodging; and said, If I would procure
any of his friends to come to his friend there, he would have
Money enough, whereof he should have a share; and also it
would be a great kindness to him; whereupon I told him I
would, provided he would write it quickly. Whereupon he
called forth his friend, and they two consulted together, and he
wrote two or three Lines, and gave them me for the said (^Butler^) .
But when (^I^) came to the place (^I^) was directed, they told
me he was gone out of Town in obedience to the Kings
Proclamation. And so (^I^) troubled my self no further, but put the
Note in my pocket: The next Morning he sent a Messenger
to me, to know what (^I^) had done in it; (^I^) desired him to tell  #
the
said Mr. (^Nettervile^) , that the said Mr. (^Butler^) was gone out  #
of
Town in Obedience to His Majesties Proclamation.
   About Ten days after (^I^) had occasion for some waste-paper;
and putting my hand in my pocket, (^I^) lit on this Note that (^I^) 
should have delivered to (^Butler^) , and opened it, and read it, and
found in it these words written, or to this effect.

[^LETTER OMITTED.^]

   This run in my mind, till about the (^5th^) instant at night;
and then being at Mr. (^Proctors^) Coffee-house at (^Charingcross^) ,
(^I^) there met with a paper, intituled, Mr. (^Praunces Discovery of
the Plot, and of Sir^) Edmondbury Godfreys (^Murtherers^) ;
wherein (amongst other things) there was mentioned two (^Irish^)     #
Priests
to be guilty, the one named (^Gerrald^) , and the other (^Kelly^) ;
<P 7>
whereupon it came into my mind, that the Man that (^I^) carried
the Note for into (^Germanstreet^) , must be the same (^Kelly^) ,
because by that Note he was committed by the name of (^Edmunds^) ,
and his name was (^Kelly^) .
   The next morning being the 16 of this instant (^January^)
(thinking to have found the same (^Kelly^) there), (^I^) came there; #
and
coming to the aforesaid (^Nettervile^) , and after some secret       #
discourse, I
asked him how his friend did that (^I^) carried the Note for? he
told me he procured Bail. Then (^I^) asked him what he was? he
told me that he was a (^Priest^) , and one of those that (^Oats^)    #
(that
Rogue) had impeached. (^I^) asked him how he could get Bail,
being a (^Priest^) ? he told me, they did not know that he was a
(^Priest^) ; and those that were his Bail, would be Bail for any for
money; and he gave them Ten Shillings a piece, and the
fellow that procured them Five Shillings; and he got them the
Copy of his Commitment for them to move by; and the (^Priest^)
promised him, the said (^Nettervile^) , seven pounds. But he had
not left it him as yet, and so we left this discourse, and came
to other.
   [$That$] he having sent by me a Letter, and a Petition to
Mrs. (^Eleanor Wall^) , a Gentlewoman that belongs to the Dutchess
of (^Portsmouth^) (whom he calls Cozen), whereby to get him
some money for his present supply: but (^I^) having no
opportunity to meet with her, could give him no account of that
matter; whereupon he said, that he was in such want, that if
he had not help speedily, he should be turned into the
Common-side: (^I^) told him that money was so scarce with me, that
(^I^) could not lend him any; but if (^I^) could, (^I^) would.
Whereupon he called me aside into the corner of the Yard, by the
Gate, and told me, That if (^I^) would be rul'd by him, he would
put me into a way whereby we should have money enough. (^I^)
asked him how? he told me, if (^I^) would but joyn and assist to
villify the evidence of (^Oats^) and (^Bedlow^) , those two Rogues;
whereupon (^I^) laughed at him, and said, It is impossible; their
evidence was grounded upon too good a foundation: he told
me (^I^) was mistaken, and (^I^) should hear otherwise in a little
while.
   Upon the (^17th^) of (^January^) (^I^) went again to him, thinking
to have gained something of him, what was become of this
(^Priest^) , but could not; and was taking my leave of him,
saying, (^I^) must go home, for (^I^) had some business to write for
(^Ireland^) , to send by Captain (^Bury^) , who was to go on         #
(^Monday^) ; he
<P 8>
told me, he believed he should stop Captain (^Burys^) Journey; I
told him (^I^) hoped not so; he answered, it should not be to his
prejudice. To which (^I^) answered, why then with all my heart,
for (^I^) would not be against any thing that should be for his good.
And so there came in one (^Russel^) an (^Irish-man^) [^NO ITALICS    #
FOR man IN SOURCE TEXT^] , that had some
business with him. And so we parted.
   [$ (^William Brooks.^) $]

[} (^THE SECOND INFORMATION OF MR.^) BROOKS.}]

I being with Mr. (^Nettervile^) at the (^Marshalsea^) in             #
(^Southwark^) , Mr.
(^Nettervile^) desired me I would do him the kindness as to
carry another Letter for his Friend to one Capt. (^Kelly^) , who had #
three
or four Employments in the (^Tower^) of (^London^) . I told him I    #
would
if it was any kindness to him. So (^Nettervile^) with (^Dominick
Kelly^) went together, and wrote a Letter to this Capt. (^Kelly^) of
the (^Tower^) ; the Contents were much the same with that I carried
to (^Pierce Butler^) . I carried it to the (^Tower^) , and Capt.     #
(^Kelly^) was
not at home; so I delivered it to his Wife. As soon as she read
it, the tears were in her eyes; she struck her hand on her breast,
saying, (^Alas poor man, is he taken? I was in hopes he had been
safe, of all the rest^) . She thankt me very kindly, and told me, as
soon as her Husband came home, she would give it him. When
I went to Mr. (^Nettervile^) again, he thankt me for carrying the
Letter for his Friend (^Dominick Kelly^) to the (^Tower^) ; and told #
me
Capt. (^Kelly^) had been with them, and treated them very civilly
with wine and meat, and had spent five shillings upon them. I
asked (^Nettervile^) what Capt. (^Kelly^) was? He told me he was a
true (^Irish^) man. I asked him if he was a Papist. He hath taken
the Oaths, said he; but he is a well-wisher to us. On (^Thursday^)
the 16 of (^January^) , (^Nettervile^) desired me to carry a Letter  #
from
himself to Capt. (^Kelly^) , which Letter signified to him that his
Friend (^Dominick Kelly^) was gone, and how that he had
promised him 7 (^l.^) to discharge himself out of the prison, but    #
had not
yet been so good as his word; therefore desired that he would
take some speedy course that he may have the 7 (^l.^) to discharge
himself out of prison. This Letter I delivered to Capt. (^Kelly's^)
own hand in the (^Tower^) . He read it, and told me he was very
glad his Friend was out; but that he had never seen him since;
pray, says he, remember me kindly to (^Mr. Nettervile^) , and tell
him, For his kindness to my Friend, I will do him all the
service I can.
<P 9>
   Upon the (^28th^) of (^January^) I was desired by Sir (^Joseph
Williamson^) , to go to Mr. (^Nettervile^) , to try what more I      #
could get
out of him. On the (^30th^) I went to him, and told him,
that I had met with Sir (^Joseph Williamson^) ; and he seemed to
be angry, and thought we had not discovered all we knew.
And I told (^Nettervile^) , that although he had promise of his
pardon, yet it was expected he should do more for it than
he had done: As for my part, said I, you know I could
discover nothing, but what discourse passed betwixt you and I,
and that I have done to the full. Therefore, if you know
any more, I would advise you to discover it; for since you
have gone thus far, (^I^) think you ought not to conceal any
thing of what you know more. The Grand thing I perceive
they desire of you, and that which I think is all they can
expect from you, is, That you would declare from whom the
500 (^l.^) was to come. He thankt me for my advice, and told
me, that he believed Sir (^Joseph Williamson^) had not perused
all his Examinations, for he had Answered all the Questions
they had asked him. And if they had any thing more to ask
him, he would Answer them.
   Upon (^Friday^) the (^31th^) of (^January^) , I acquainted Sir    #
(^Joseph
Williamson^) with what he said; he ordered him to be brought to
the Council on (^Saturday^) morning, where I met him at the door,
before he was call'd; I told him, I supposed the chief Question
that would be put to him, would be, Whose this 500 (^l.^) was?
and begged of him that he would discover what he knew of it.
Upon his coming out from the Council, I asked him if that was
not the question they put to him? he told me it was: I asked
him what account he had given them? he told me he thought
they were satisfied, for they were very kind to him, and promised
him, that so long as they lived, he should have the protection of
that Board.
   On (^Tuesday^) , the (^4th^) of (^February^) following, Sir       #
(^Joseph
Williamson^) seeing me at the Council-door, called me in, and asked
me if I thought I could get any more out of (^Nettervile^) ? I told
him I thought he had given him satisfaction when he was before
them, concerning whose the money was. I told Sir (^Joseph^) the
discourse I had with (^Nettervile^) at his going into the House, and #
at
his coming back; then he told me, that he had not been
ingenuous with them, for he would confess nothing at first; but after
some Questions being asked in general terms, he told them that
it was to come from some of the Lords in the Tower; and
<P 10>
desired me that I would go once more to see if I could get any thing
from him.
   The next morning the Earl of (^Essex^) desired to speak with me;
I waited upon him at the Council-Chamber; and he desired me
also, that I would go to Mr. (^Nettervile^) to see what I could get
further from him.
   So on (^Thursday^) the (^6th^) of (^February^) , I did go to Mr.
(^Nettervile^) , and told him I was not come on a bare visit; but I  #
was
commanded by the Earl of (^Essex^) , and Sir (^Joseph Williamson^)   #
(whom
he knew had both been very kind to him) to advise him, that
he would be ingenuous, and discover what further he knew in
this business. Truly, said I, I suppose all they do expect from
you, is, that you would make some clear discovery unto them
whose money this 500 (^l.^) was; saith he (Swearing by his Soul)
(^I^) did tell them all I knew, (^I^) thought they had been          #
satisfied; no,
said (^I^) , they are not; and Sir (^Joseph Williamson^) saith, you  #
were
not ingenuous; for you only in general terms told them it was
some of the Lords money in the Tower. Now if you can
remember which of the Lords money it was, it may satisfie them; for
they judg, and so do (^I^) , and every one else, that (^Russel^) would
as easily tell you whose it was, as to tell you it was some of the
Lords in the Tower. I could get no more from him a great while;
but after we had sate and discoursed some time, he told me that
(^Brewer^) was to be before the Council the next day, and he
believed he should be sent for too; I suppose not, said (^I^) ,      #
unless I
have some better account to give them from you: so just upon
my coming away I told him; Mr. (^Nettervile^) , I am sorry I can give
no better account of my Journey to you; therefore pray, if you
have any thing more to say, let me know it before I go. After he
had paused a while, By my Soul, said he; I cannot
remember the particular name of any Lord but one. Who is that,
said I? my Lord (^Stafford^) , saith he; but all the rest were to
contribute to it; for (^Russel^) told me he was to go immediately to #
the
Tower, to get the Money raised; and that it was a difficult thing
to get all the Lords together; and if he should go to them
apart, they might make scruples, and so delay the business;
and therefore he should make all the haste he could to get
the Money ready.
