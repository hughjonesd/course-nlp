[$ (^Enter Mistris Mary, Mistris Splay, and Brabo.^) $]
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] (^I^) prethee tell me (^Brabo^) , what Planet       #
thinkst thou
gouernd at my conception, that I liue thus openly to the
world?
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] Two Planets raind at once, (^Venus^) thats you,
And (^Mars^) thats (^I^) , were in coniunction.
   [$ (^Splay.^) $] Prethee, prethee, in faith that coniunction
copulatiue, is that part of speech that I liue by.
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] Ha, ha, to see the world, we swaggerers
That liue by oathes and big-mouth'd menaces,
Are now reputed for the tallest men:
He that hath now a black muchato
Reaching from eare to eare, or turning vp
(^ (\Puncto reuerso\) ^) , bristling towards the eye:
He that can hang two hansom tooles at his side,
Go in disguisde attire, weare Iron enough,
Is held a tall man and a souldier.
He that with greatest grace can sweare gogs zounds,
Or in a Tauerne make a drunken fray,
Can cheat at Dice, swagger in bawdie houses,
Weare veluet on his face, and with a grace
Can face it out with as (^I^) am a souldier.
He that can clap his sword vpon the boord
Hee's a braue man, and such a man am I.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] She that with kisses can both kil & cure,
That liues by loue, that sweares by nothing else
But by a kisse, which is no common oath:
That liues by lying, and yet oft tels truth;
That takes most pleasure when she takes most paines:
Shee's a good wench my boy, and such am I.
   [$ (^Splay.^) $] She that is past it, and praies for them that may.
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] Is an old Bawd as you are Mistris (^Splay^) .
<P D4R>
   [$ (^Splay.^) $] O do not name that name, do you not know
That (^I^) could neuer endure to heare that name.
But if your man would leaue vs, (^I^) would read
The lesson that last night (^I^) promist you.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] (^I^) prethee leaue vs, we would be alone.
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] And will and must: if you bid me be gone,
(^I^) will withdraw, and draw on any he
That in the worlds wide round dare cope with me.
Mistris farewell, to none (^I^) neuer speake 
So kind a word. My salutations are,
Farewell and be hangd, or in the diuels name.
What they haue bene my many fraies can tell,
You cannot fight, therefore to you farwell. [$ (^ (Exit.^) $] 
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] O this same swaggerer is the bulwark of my          #
reputation,
But Mistris (^Splay^) , now to your lecture that you promist me.
   [$ (^Splay.^) $] Daughter attend, for (^I^) will tell thee now
What in my yong daies I my selfe haue tried:
Be rul'd by me and (^I^) will make thee rich.
You God be praisde are faire, and as they say
Full of good parts, you haue bene often tried
To be a woman of good carriage,
VVhich in my mind is very commendable.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] It is indeed. Forward good mother (^Splay^) .
   [$ (^Splay.^) $] And as (^I^) told you, being faire, (^I^) wish
Sweet daughter you were as fortunate.
VVhen any sutor comes to aske thy loue,
Looke not into his words, but into his sleeue,
If thou canst learne what language his purse speakes,
Be rul'd by that, thats golden eloquence.
Mony can make a slauering tongue speake plaine:
If he that loues thee be deform'd and rich,
Accept his loue, gold hides deformitie.
Gold can make limping (^Vulcan^) walke vpright,
Make squint eyes looke strait, a crabd face looke smooth,
<P D4V>
Guilds Copernoses, makes them looke like gold:
Fils ages wrinkles vp, and makes a face
As old as (^Nestors^) , looke as yong as (^Cupids^) .
If thou wilt arme thy selfe against all shifts,
Regard all men according to their gifts.
This if thou practise, thou when I am dead
Wilt say old mother (^Splay^) soft laid thy head.
[$ (^Enter yong Arthur.^) $] 
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] Soft who comes here? begone good Mistris (^Splay^) ,
Of thy rules practise this is my first day.
   [$ (^Splay.^) $] God for thy passion what a beast am (^I^) ,
To scar the bird that to the net would flie. [$ (^ (Exit.^) $] 
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] By your leaue Mistresse.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] VVhat to do Maister?
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] To giue me leaue to loue you.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] I had rather afford you some loue to leaue me.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] (^I^) would you would assoone loue me, as      #
(^I^) could leaue you.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] (^I^) pray you what are you sir?
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] A man Ile assure you.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] How should (^I^) know that?
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] Trie me by my word, for (^I^) say (^I^) am a   #
man,
Or by my deed, Ile proue my selfe a man. 
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] Are you not Maister (^Arthur^) ?
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Not M. (^Arthur^) , but (^Arthur^) , and your  #
seruant
sweete Mistris (^Mary^) .
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] Not Mistris (^Mary^) , but (^Mary^) and your        #
handmaid,
sweet Maister (^Arthur^) .
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] That (^I^) loue you, let my face tell you:     #
that I
loue you more then ordinarily, let this kisse testifie: and
that I loue you feruently and entierly, aske this gift, and
see what it will answere you. My selfe, my purse, and all
being wholy at your seruice.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] That (^I^) take your loue in good part, my thankes
shall speak for me: that (^I^) am pleasde with your kisse, this
<P E1R>
interest of an other shall certifie you: and that I accept
your gift, my prostrate seruice and selfe shall witnes with
me. My loue, my lips, and sweet selfe, are at your seruice:
wilt please you to come neare sir?
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Yon. Lu.^) ^] O that my wife  #
were dead, here would I make
My second choise, would she were buried,
From out her graue this Marigold should grow,
Which in my nuptials (^I^) wold weare with pride.
Die shall shee, I haue doom'd her destenie.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] Tis newes M. (^Arthur^) to see you in such a place,
How doth your wife?
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] Faith Mistris (^Mary^) at the point of death,
And long she cannot liue, she shall not liue
To trouble me in this my second choice.
[$ (^Enter Aminadab with a bill and head-peece.^) $] 
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] I pray forbeare sir, for here comes my Loue,
Good sir for this time leaue me: by this kisse
You cannot aske the question at my hands
I will denie you: pray you get you gone.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] Farwell sweet Mistris (^Mary^) . [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] Sweet adieu:
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] Stand to me bill, and head-peece sit thou close,
I heare my Loue, my wench, my duck, my deare,
Is sought by many sutors, but with this
Ile keep the doore, and enter he that dare.
(^Virga^) be gone, thy twigs Ile turne to steele,
These fingers that were expert in the Ierke,
In steed of lashing of the trembling (^podes^) ,
Must learne pash and knock, and beate and mall,
Cleaue pates, and (^caputs^) he that enters here
Comes on his death, (^ (\mors mort\) ^) , is he shall taste.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] Alas poore foole, the Pedants mad for loue,
Thinkes me more mad that I would marry him:
Hee's come to watch me with a rustie bill,  
<P E1V>
To keep my friends away by force of armes,
I will not see him but stand still aside,
And here obserue him what he meanes to doo.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] (^ (\O vtinam\) ^) , that he that loues her best
Durst offer but to tuch her in this place.
(^ (\Per Iehoua, & Iunonem hoc\) ^) ,
Shall pash his Coxcombe such a knock,
As that his soule his course shall take
To (^Limbo^) , and (^Auernus^) lake.
In vaine I watch in this darke hole,
Would any liuing durst my manhood trie,
And offer to come vp the staires this way.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] O we should see you make a goodly fray.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] The wench I here watch with my bill,
(^ (\Amo, amas, amaui\) ^) still.
(^ (\Qui audet\) ^) let him come that dare,
Death, hell, and Limbo be his share.
[$ (^Enter Brabo.^) $] 
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] Wheres mistris (^Mary^) , neuer a post here,
A bar of Iron gainst which to trie my sword?
Now by my beard a daintie peece of steele.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] O (^Ioue^) what a qualme is this I feele?
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] Come hither (^Mall^) , is none here but we two?
When didst thou see the starueling Schoole-maister?
That Rat, that shrimp, that spindleshanck, that Wren, that
sheep-biter, that leane chittiface, that famine, that leane
Enuy, that all bones, that bare Anatomy, that Iack a Lent,
that ghost, that shadow, that Moone in the waine.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] I waile in woe, I plunge in paine.
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] When next I finde him here Ile hang him vp
Like a dried Sawsedge, in the Chimnies top:
That Stock-fish, that poore Iohn, that gut of men.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] O that I were at home againe.
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] When he comes next turne him into the streets,
<P E2R>
Now come lets dance the shaking of the sheets.                       #
[$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] (^ (\Qui que quod\) ^) , hence boystrous bill,     #
come gentle Rod.
Had not grim (^Malkin^) stampt and star'd,
(^Aminadab^) had little car'd:
Or if in stead of this browne bill,
I had kept my mistris (^Virga^) still,
And he vpon an others back,
His points vntrust, his breeches slack:
My countenance he should not dash,
For I am expert in the lash.
But my sweet Lasse my loue doth flie,
Which shall make me by poyson die.
(^ (\Per fidem\) ^) , I will rid my life,
Either by poyson, sword, or knife. [$ (^Exit.^) $] 
[$ (^Enter Mistris Arthur, and Pipkin.^) $] 
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Sirra when saw you your Maister?
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] Faith Mistris when I last lookt vpon him.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] And when was that?
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] When I beheld him.
   [$ (^Mist. Ar.^) $] And when was that?
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] Mary when he was in my sight, and that was
yesterday, since when I saw not my maister, nor lookt on my
M. nor beheld my maister, nor had any sight of my M.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Was he not at my father in lawes?
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] Yes mary was he.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Didst thou not intreat him to come home?
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] How should I mistris, he came not there to day.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Didst not thou say he was there?
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] True mistris he was there, but I did not tel ye    #
whe~,
He hath bin there diuers times, but not of late.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] About your busines, here Ile sit and wait
His comming home, though it be nere so late.
Now once againe goe looke him at the Change,
Or at the Church with Sir (^Aminadab^) ,
<P E2V>
Tis told me they vse often conference:
When that is done, get you to schoole againe.
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] I had rather plaie the trewant at home, then goe
seeke my M. at schoole: let me see what age am (^I^) , some
foure & twentie, and how haue (^I^) profited, (^I^) was fiue yeare
learning to crish Crosse from great A. and fiue yeare
longer comming to F. (^I^) there I stucke some three yeare
before I could come to q. and so in processe of time (^I^) came
to e perce e, and comperce, and tittle, then (^I^) got to a. e.
i. o. u. after to our Father, and in the sixteenth yeare of
my age, and the fifteenth of my going to schoole, (^I^) am in
good time gotten to a Nowne, by the same token there
my hose went downe: then (^I^) got to a Verbe, there I
began first to haue a beard: the~ (^I^) came to (^ (\Iste, ista,     #
istud\) ^) , there
my M. whipt me till he fetcht the blood, and so foorth: so
that now I am come the greatest scholler in the schoole:
for I am bigger then two or three of them. But I am gone,
farewell mistresse. [$ (^ (Exit.^) $] 
[$ (^Enter Anselme and Fuller.^) $] 
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Loue none at all, they will forsweare themselues,
And when you vrge them with it, their replies
Are, that (^Ioue^) laughes at Louers periuries.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] You told me of a Iest concerning that,
(^I^) prethee let me heare it.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] That thou shalt.
My mistris in an humor had protested,
That aboue all the world she lou'd me best,
Saying with sutors she was oft molested,
And she had lodg'd her hart within my brest:
And sware (but me) both by her maske & fan,
She neuer would so much as name a man.
Not name a man quoth I, yet be aduisde,
Not loue a man but me, let it be so:
You shall not think quoth she my thoughts disguisde,
<P E3R>
In flattring language, or dissembling show:
(^I^) say againe, and (^I^) know what (^I^) do,
(^I^) will not name a man aliue but you.
Into her house (^I^) came at vnaware,
Her backe was to me and (^I^) was not seene,
(^I^) stole behind her till (^I^) had her faire,
Then with my hands (^I^) closed both her eyne,
She blinded thus, beginneth to bethinke her
Which of her Loues it was that did hood-winck her,
First she begins to guesse & name a man
That (^I^) well knew, but she had knowne far better.
The next (^I^) neuer did suspect till than:
Still of my name (^I^) could not heare a letter,
Then mad, she did name (^Robin^) , and then (^Iames^) ,
Till she had reckoned vp some twentie names,
At length when she had counted vp her score,
As one among the rest she hit on mee:
(^I^) askt her if she could not recken more,
And pluckt away my hands to let her see.
But when she lookt back and saw me behind her
She blusht, and askt if it were (^I^) did blind her?
And since (^I^) sware both by her maske and fan,
To trust no she tongue, that can name a man.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Your great oath hath some exceptions:
But to our former purpose, yon is Mistris (^Arthur^) ,
We will attempt another kind of wooing,
And make her hate her husband if we can.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] But not a word of passion or of loue.
Haue at her now to trie her patience,
God saue you mistris.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] You are welcome sir.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] (^I^) pray you wheres your husband?
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Yon. Ar.^) ^] Not within.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Who M. (^Arthur^) ? him (^I^) saw euen now
<P E3V>
At mistris (^Maries^) the braue Curtizans.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Wrong not my husbands reputatio~ so,
I neither can nor will beleeue you sir.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Poore gentlewoman how much (^I^) pittie you,
Your husband is become her only guest:
He lodges there, and daily diets there,
He riots, reuels, and doth all things,
Nay he is held the M. of misrule,
Mongst a most loathed and abhorred Crew:
And can you being a woman suffer this?
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Sir, sir, I vnderstand you well inough,
Admit my husband doth frequent that house
Of such dishonest vsage, (^I^) suppose
He doth it but in zeale to bring them home
By his good counsell, from that course of sinne:
And like a Christian, seeing them astray
In the broad path that to damnation leades,
He vseth thither to direct their feete
Into the narrow way that guides to heauen.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Was euer woman guld so palpably?
But Mistris (^Arthur^) thinke you as you say?
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Sir what (^I^) think (^I^) think, and what I say
I would I could enioyne you to beleeue.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Faith mistris (^Arthur^) I am sory for you,
And in good sooth, I wish it laie in me
To remedie the least part of these wrongs
Your vnkind husband daily profers you.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] You are deceiu'd he is not vnkind,
Although he beare an outward face of hate,
His hart and soule are both assured mine.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Fie mistris (^Arthur^) , take a better spirit,
Be not so timerous to rehearse your wrongs,
(^I^) say your husband haunts bad company,
Swaggerers, cheaters, wanton Curtizans.
<P E4R>
There he defiles his bodie, staines his soule,
Consumes his wealth, vndoes himselfe and you,
In danger of diseases, whose vilde names
Are not for any honest mouthes to speake,
Nor any chaste eares to receiue and heare.
O he will bring that face admir'd for beautie,
To be more loathed then a leaprous skin:
Diuorce your selfe now whilst the clouds grow black,
Prepare your selfe a shelter for the storme,
Abandon his most loathed fellowship:
You are yong mistris, will you loose your youth?
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Tempt no more diuel, thy deformitie
Hath chaung'd it selfe into an angels shape,
But yet (^I^) know thee by thy course of speech:
Thou gets an apple to betray poore (^Eue^) ,
Whose outside beares a show of pleasant fruite,
But the vilde branch on which this apple grew,
Was that which drew poore (^Eue^) from Paradice.
Thy Syrens song could make me drowne my selfe,
But (^I^) am tyed vnto the mast of truth.
Admit my husband be inclin'd to vice,
My vertues may in time recall him home,
But if we both should desp'rate runne to sinne,
We should abide certaine destruction.
But hee's like one that ouer a sweet face
Puts a deformed vizard for his soule,
Is free from any such intents of ill:
Only to try my patience, he puts on
An vgly shape of black intemperance.
Therefore this blot of shame which he now weares,
I with my praiers will purge, wash with teares.
[$ (^Exit.^) $] 
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] (^Fuller.^) 
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] (^Anselme.^)
<P E4V>
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] How lik'st thou this?
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] As schoole-boyes (^Ierkes^) , Apes whips, as Lions #
Cocks,
As Furies do fasting daies, and diuels crosses,
As maides to haue their mariage daies put off:
(^I^) like it as the thing (^I^) most do loath,
What wilt thou do? for shame persist no more
In this extremitie of friuolous loue.
(^I^) see my doctrine moues no precise eares,
But such as are profest inamoratos.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] O (^I^) shall die.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Tush liue to laugh a little,
Here's the best subiect that thy loue affords,
Listen a while and heare this: hoboy speake.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] As in presenti [^SOURCE TEXT: ptesenti^] , thou    #
loath'st the gift I sent thee,
(^ (\Nolo plus\) ^) tarrie but die, for the beautious marry,
Fain wold (^I^) die by a sword, but what sword shal (^I^) die by?
Or by a stone, what stone? (^ (\nullus lapis iacet ibi.\) ^)
Knife I haue none to sheath in my brest, or emptie my full vaines,
Here is no wal or post which I can soile with my brus'd
braines.
First will I therfore say 2. or 3. Creedes and Auemaries,
And after goe buy a poison at the Apothecaries.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] (^I^) prethee (^Anselme^) but obserue this fellow,
Doest not heare him? he would die for loue,
That mishapt loue thou wouldst condemne in him,
I see in thee, I prethee note him well.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Were I assur'd [^SOURCE TEXT: assurs'd^] that I    #
were such a Louer,
I should be with my selfe quite out of loue:
I prethee lets perswade him still to liue.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] That were a dangerous case, perhaps the fellow
In desperation would to sooth vs vp,
Promise repentant recantation,
And after fall into that desperate course,
Both which I will preuent with policie.
<P F1R>
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] O death come with thy dart, come death whe~ I bid  #
thee,
(^ (\Mors vem veni mors\) ^) , and from this misery rid mee.
She whom I lou'd, whom I lou'd, eue~ she my sweet pretie (^Mary^) ,
Doth but flout & mock, & Iest, and dissimulary.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Ile fit him finely: in this paper is
The Iuice of Mandrake, by a Doctor made
To cast a man whose leg should be cut off,
Into a deep, a cold and senceles sleepe,
Of such approued operation,
That who so takes it, is for twice twelue houres
Breathlesse, and to all mens iudgements past all sence:
This will I giue the pedant but in sport,
For when tis knowne to take effect in him,
The world will but esteeme it as a Iest:
Besides it may be a meanes to saue his life,
For being perfect poyson as it seemes,
His meaning is, some couetous slaue for coyne
Will sell it him, though it be held by lawe
To be no better then flat felonie.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Vphold the Iest, but he hath spied vs, peace.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] Gentiles God saue you,
Here is a man I haue noted oft, most learned in Physick,
One man he helpt of the Cough, another he heald of the tisick:
And I will boord him thus: (^ (\Salue\) ^) o`                        #
(^ (\Salue Magister\) ^) .
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] (^ (\Gratus mihi aduenis quid me cum vis.\) ^)
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] (^ (\Optatum venis paucis to volo.\) ^)
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] (^ (\Si quid industria nostra tibi faciet dic      #
queso.\) ^)
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] Attend me sir, I haue a simple house,
But as the learned (^Diogenes^) saith
In his Epistle to (^Tertullian^) ,
It is extremely troubled with great Ratts,
I haue no mus pusse nor grey eyde Cat
To hunt them out. O could your learned Art
Shew me a meanes how I might poyson them:
<P F1V>
(^ (\Tuus dum suus\) ^) , sir (^Aminadab^) .
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] With all my hart, I am no Rat-catcher,
But if you need a poyson, here is that
Will pepper both your Dogs & Rats and Cats:
Nay spare your purse, I giue this in good will,
And as it proues I pray you send to me,
And let me know, wold you ought else with me?
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] (^ (\Minime quidem\) ^) , heer's that you say wil  #
take them?
A thousand thankes sweet sir, I say to you
As (^Tully^) in his Aesops Fables said,
(^ (\Ago tibi gratias\) ^) , so farewell, (^ (\vale\) ^) .           #
[$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Adiew. Come let vs goe, I long to see
What the euent of this new Iest will bee.
[$ (^Enter yong Arthur.^) $]
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] Good morrow gentlemen, saw you not this way
As you were walking, Sir (^Aminadab^) ?
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] M. (^Arthur^) as I take it.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Sir the same.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Sir I desire you more familiar loue,
Would I could bid my selfe vnto your house,
For I haue wisht for your acquaintance long.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Sweet M. (^Anselme^) I desire yours too:
Wil you come dine with me at home to morow,
You shall be welcome I assure you sir.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] I feare sir I shall proue too bold a guest.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] You shal be welcome if you bring your friend.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] O Lord sir, we shall be too troublesome.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] Nay now I will inforce a promise from you,
Shall I expect you?
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Yes with all my heart.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] A thousand thankes. Yonders the schoolemaister.
So till to morrow twentie times farewell.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] I double all your farewels twentie fold.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] O this acquaintance was well scrapte of me,
<P F2R>
By this my Loue to morrow I shall see. [$ (^Exit.^) $] 
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] This poyson shall by force expell,
(^ (\Amorem\) ^) loue, (^ (\Infernum\) ^) hell.
(^ (\Per hoc venenum ego\) ^) (^I^) , 
For my sweet louely Lasse will die.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] What do I hear of poison, which sweet means
Must make me a braue frolick widower?
It seemes the doting foole being forlorne
Hath got some compound mixture, in dispaire
To end his desperate fortunes and his life:
Ile get it from him, and with this make way
To my wiues night, and to my Loues faire day.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] In (^ (\nomine domine\) ^) , friends farewell:
I know death comes here's such a smell.
(^ (\Pater & mater\) ^) , father and mother,
(^ (\Frater & soror\) ^) , sister and brother,
And my sweet (^Mary^) , not these drugges,
Do send me to the Infernall bugges,
But thy vnkindnesse, so adieu,
Hob-goblins now I come to you.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Hold man I say, what wil the mad man do?
I haue I got thee, thou shalt goe with me:
No more of that, fie Sir (^Minadab^)
Destroy your selfe: If I but heare hereafter
You practice such reuenge vpon your selfe,
All your friends shall know that for a wench,
A paltry wench, you would haue kild your selfe.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] (^ (\O tace queso\) ^) , do not name
This frantick deed of mine for shame:
My sweet magister not a word,
Ile neither drowne me in a ford
Nor giue my necke such a scope,
To imbrace it with a hempen rope,
Ile die no way till nature will me,
<P F2V>
And death come with his dart and kill me.
If what is past you will conceale,
And nothing to the world reueale,
Nay as (^Quintillian^) said of yore,
Ile striue to kill my selfe no more.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] On that condition Ile conceale this deed,
To morow pray come and dine with me:
For I haue many strangers, mongst the rest,
Some are desirous of your company.
You will not faile me?
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] No in sooth, Ile try the sharpnes of my tooth,
In steed of poyson, I will eate
Rabets, Capons, and such meate:
And so as (^Pithagoras^) saies,
With wholesome fare prolong my daies.
But Sir will Mistris (^Mall^) be there?
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] She shall, she shall man neuer feare.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] Then my spirit becomes stronger,
And I will liue and stretch longer:
For (^Ouid^) said, and did not lie, 
That poysoned men do often die.
But poyson henceforth Ile not eate,
Whilst I can other victualls get:
To morow if you make a feast,
Be sure sir I will be your guest.
But keep my counsell, (^ (\vale tu\) ^) ,
And till to morow sir adieu:
At your Table (^I^) will proue
If (^I^) can eate away my loue. [$ (^Exit.^) $] 
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] O (^I^) am glad (^I^) haue thee, now deuise
A way how to bestow it cunningly:
It shall be thus: to morow Ile pretend
A reconcilement [^SOURCE TEXT: recocilement^] twixt my wife and me,
And to that end I will inuite thus many:
<P F3R>
First Iustice (^Reason^) , as the chiefe man there.
My Father (^Arthur^) [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Arther^) ^] , old (^Lusam^) ,  #
yong (^Lusam^) , M. (^Fuller^) ,
And M. (^Anselme^) (^I^) haue bid alreadie.
Then will (^I^) haue my louely (^Mary^) too,
Be it but to spight my wife before she die:
For die she shall before to morrow night.
The operation of this poyson is
Not suddenly to kill, they that take it
Fall in a sleepe, and then tis past recure,
And this will (^I^) put in her Cup to morrow.
[$ (^Enter Pipkin running.^) $] 
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] This tis to haue such a Maister, (^I^) haue sought #
him
at the Change, at the schoole, at euery place, but (^I^) cannot
finde him no where. O cry mercy, my Mistris would
intreat you to come home.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] I cannot come to night, some vrgent busines
Will all this night imploy me otherwise.
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] I beleeue my Mistresse would con you as much
thanke to do that businesse at home as abroad.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Here take my purse, and bid my wife prouide
Good cheare against to morrow, there will be
Two or three strangers of my late acquaintance.
Sirra goe you to Iustice (^Reasons^) house,
Inuite him first with all solemnitie.
Goe to my Fathers, and my Father in lawes,
Here take this note.
The rest that come (^I^) will inuite my selfe,
About it with what quick dispatch thou canst.
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] I warrant you Maister Ile dispatch this businesse
with more honestie, then youle dispatch yours. But
Maister will the gentlewoman be there?
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] What gentlewoman?
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] The gentlewoman of the old house, that is as wel
knowne by the colour shee laies of her chees, as an
<P F3V>
Ale-house by the painting is laid of his Lettice: she that is like
(^Homo^) , Common to all men: she that is beholding to no
Trade, but liues of her selfe.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Sirra be gone, or I will send you hence.
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] Ile go, but by this hand Ile tell my Mistris as    #
soone
as I come home, that Mistris light-heeles comes to dinner
to morrow.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Sweet Mistris (^Mary^) Ile inuite my selfe:
And there Ile frolick, sup, and spend the night.
My Plot is currant, here tis in my hand
Will make me happie in my second choyce,
And I may freely chalenge as mine owne,
What I am now inforc't [^SOURCE TEXT: infore't^] to seeke by stealth.
Loue is not much vnlike Ambition,
For in them both all lets must be remoued
Twixt euery Crowne & him that would aspire,
And he that will attempt to winne the same,
Must plundge vp to the depth ore head & eares,
And hazard drowning in that purple sea.
So he that loues, must needs through blood and fire,
And do all things to compasse his desire.
[$ (^Enter Mistris Arthur and her Mayde.^) $] 
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Come spread the Table: Is the hall well rubd,
The cushions in the windowes neatly laid,
The Cupboord of plate set out, the Casements stuck
With Rosemary and Flowers, the Carpets brusht?
   [$ (^Mayd.^) $] I forsooth Mistris.
   [$ (^Mis.^) $] Looke to the kitchen Mayd, and bid the Cooke
take downe the Ouen stone, the pies be burnt: here take

the cloth,
Fetch the cleane diaper napkins from my chest,
Set out the guilded salt, and bid the fellow
<P F4R>
Make himselfe handsome, get him a cleane band.
   [$ (^Mayd.^) $] Indeed forsooth Mistris he is such a slouen
That nothing will sit handsome about him,
He had a pound of sope to scowre his face,
And yet his brow lookes like the chimney stocke.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Heele be a slouen stil: Mayd take this Apron,
And bring me one of Linnen, quickly Mayd.

Ere we be readie, what a spight is this.
   [$ (^Within.^) $] (^Mistresse.^)

   [$ (^Within.^) $] Mistris I pray take (^Pipkin^) from the fire,
We cannot keepe his fingers from the rost.

Fie, fie, neuer out of the kitchin,
Still broyling by the fire.

Till the broath be inough.

And wait to day. So let me see my Apron.

Thus age seekes ease: where is your husband Mistris?

   [$ (^Old Lu.^) $] What say mine eyes, is Iustice (^Reason^) here?
Mountaines may meet, and so (^I^) see may wee.
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] Well when men meete they meete,
And when they part, they oft leaue one anothers company:

You should not sit so sadlie as you do.

All this is no more (^ (\prebibo tibi\) ^) .
<P G2V>
   [$ (^Mary.^) $] I thanke you sir, Mistris this draught shall be
To him that loues both you and me.
   [$ (^Mist. Ar.^) $] I know your meaning.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Now to me;
If she haue either loue or charitie.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Heare M. Iustice, this to your graue yeares,
A mournfull draught God wot, halfe wine, halfe teares.
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] Let come my wench, here youngsters, to you all,
You are silent, here's that will make you talke.
Wenches, me thinke you sit like Puritants,
Neuer a Ieast abroad to make them laugh?
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Sir, since you moue speech of a Puritant,
If you will giue me audience I will tell ye
As good a Ieast as euer you did heare.
   [$ (^Old Ar.^) $] A Ieast, thats excellent.
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] Before hand lets prepare our selues to laugh,
A Ieast is nothing if it be not grac'd:
Now, now, (^I^) pray you when begins this Ieast?
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] I came vnto a Puritant to wooe her,
And roughly did salute her with a kisse:
Away quoth she, and rudely pusht me fro her,
Brother, by yea and nay I like not this,
And still with amorous talke she was saluted,
My artlesse speech with scripture was confuted.
   [$ (^Old Lu.^) $] Good, good indeed, the best that ere I heard.
   [$ (^Old Ar.^) $] I promise you it was exceeding good.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Oft (^I^) frequented her abroad by night,
And courted her, and spake her wondrous faire,
But euer somewhat did offend her sight,
Either my double ruffe, or my long hayre:
My skarfe was vain, my garments hung too low,
My Spanish shooe was cut too broad at toe.
[^WORDS MISSING DUE TO SOURCE TEXT DAMAGE: SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION IN
NEXT TWO UTTERANCES IS THE READING IN ANOTHER, CONTEMPORANEOUS COPY.^]
   [$ (^All.^) $] Ha, ha, the best that euer I heard.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] I parted for that time, and came againe,
<P G3R>
Seeming to be conformd in looke and speech,
My shooes were sharpe toed, and my band was plaine,
Close to my thigh my metamorphis'd breech:
My cloake was narrow Capte, my haire cut shorter,
Off went my Skarfe, thus marcht I to the Porter.
   [$ (^All.^) $] Ha, ha, was euer heard the like?
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] The Porter spying me, did lead me in,
Where his faire mistris sat reading on a chapter:
Peace to this house quoth I, and those within,
Which holy speech with admiration wrapt her,
And euer as (^I^) spake, and came her nie,
Seeming diuine, turnd vp the white of eye.
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] So, so, what then, what then?
   [$ (^Old Lu.^) $] Forward, I pray forward sir.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] I spake diuinely, and I call'd her sister,
And by this meanes we were acquainted well:
By yea and nay, (^I^) will quoth (^I^) , and kist her.
She blusht & said that long tongu'd men would tell,
(^I^) seem'd to be as secret as the night,
And said, on sooth (^I^) would put out the light.
   [$ (^Old Ar.^) $] In sooth he would, a passing passing Ieast.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] O do not sweare quoth she, yet put it out,
Because (^I^) would not haue you breake your oath.
(^I^) felt a bed there as (^I^) groapt about,
In troath quoth (^I^) , here will we rest vs both.
Sweare you in troth quoth she, had you not sworne
(^I^) had not don't, but tooke it in foule scorne,
Then you will come quoth (^I^) ; though (^I^) be loath,
Ile come quoth she, be it but to keepe your oath.
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] Tis verie pretie, but now whens the Ieast?
   [$ (^Old Ar.^) $] O forward to the Ieast in any case.
   [$ (^Old Lu.^) $] (^I^) would not for angell loose the Ieast.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Heres right the dunghil Cock that finds a pearle,
To talke of wit to these, is as a man
<P G3V>
Should cast out Iewels to a heard of swine,
Why in the last words did consist the Ieast.
   [$ (^Old Lus.^) $] I, in the last words? ha, ha, ha,
It was an excellent admired ieast,
To them that vnderstood it.
[$ (^Enter young Arthur, with a Cup of Wine.^) $]
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] It was indeed, (^I^) must for fashions sake
Say as they say, but otherwise, o` God.
Good M. (^Arthur^) thankes for our good cheare. 
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Gentleme~, welcome all, now heare me speak;
One speciall cause that mou'd me lead you hither,
Is for auncient grudge that hath long since
Continued twixt my modest wife and me,
The wrongs that I haue done her, I recant.
In either hand I hold a seuerall Cup,
This in the right hand, Wife I drinke to thee,
This in the left hand pledge me in this draught,
Burying all former hatred, so haue to thee. [$ (^He drinkes.^) $] 
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] The welcom'st pledge that yet I euer tooke:
Were this wine poyson, or did taste like gall,
The honey sweet condition of your draught,
Would make it drinke like Nectar, I will pledge you,
Were it the last that I should euer drinke.
   [$ (^Yon. Ar.^) $] Make that account; thus Gentlemen you see,
Our late discord brought to a vnitie.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] (^ (\Ecce quam bonum & quam iucundum,
Est habitare featres in vnum.\) ^)
   [$ (^Old Ar.^) $] My heart doth tast the sweetnes of your pledge,
And I am glad to see this sweete accord.

But may be exceeding glad.
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] I am, I marrie am I, that I am.
   [$ (^Yon. Lus.^) $] The best accord that could betide their loues.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] The worst accord that could betide my loue.
<P G4R>

And from the Pond and Riuer cleere,

My loue and heart shall on your seruice waite.

   [$ (^Ans.^) $] So doth my loue on thee, but long no more,
To her rich loue, thy seruice is too poore.

   [$ (^Ful.^) $] For shame no more, you had best expostulate
Your loue with euery straunger, leaue these sighes,
And chaunge them to familiar conference.

Her constancie, modest humilitie,
Her patience, and admired temperance,
Haue made me loue all women kinde the better.

She is this day as cold as clay, my Mistris she is dead:
O Lord, my mistris, my mistris. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

O (^I^) am sicke, my paine growes worse and worse,

This day one body and two hearts are dead. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $] 
   [$ (^Yong Lus.^) $] But now she was as well as well might be,
And on the sudden dead; ioy in excesse
Hath ouerrunne her poore disturbed soule.
Ile after and see how Maister (^Arthur^) takes it.
His former hate far more suspitious makes it. [$ (^Exit.^) $] 
[$ (^Enter Hugh.^) $] 
   [$ (^Hu.^) $] My M. hath left his gloues behind where he sat in
his chaire, and hath sent me to fetch them, it is such an old
snudge, he will not loose the dropping of his nose.
[$ (^Enter Pipkin.^) $] 
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] O Mistris, o` (^Hugh^) , o` (^Hugh^) , o` Mistris, #

<P H1R>
needs beate thee, I am mad, I am lunatike, I must fall vpon
thee, my Mistris is dead.
   [$ (^Hu.^) $] O M. (^Pipkin^) , what do you meane, what do you 
meane M. (^Pipkin^) ?
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] O (^Hue^) , o` Mistris, o` Mistris, o` (^Hue^) .

   [$ (^Pip.^) $] O (^Hue^) , I am mad, beare with me, I cannot chuse,
o` death, o` Mistris, o` Mistris, o` death. [$ (^Exit.^) $] 
   [$ (^Hu.^) $] Death quotha, he hath almost made me dead with
beating.
[$ (^Enter Reason, old Arthur, and old Lusam.^) $] 
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] I wonder why the knaue my man stayes thus,
And comes not backe, see where the villaine loyters.
[$ (^Enter Pipkin.^) $] 
   [$ (^Pip.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Bra.^) ^] O M. (^Iustice^) , M.   #

why I thus blow and bluster, my Mistris is dead, dead is
my Mistris, and therefore hang your selues, o` my Mistris,
my Mistris. [$ (^Exit.^) $] 
   [$ (^Old Ar.^) $] My sonnes wife dead?
   [$ (^Old Lus.^) $] My daughter.
[$ (^Enter young Arthur mourning.^) $] 
   [$ (^Iust.^) $] Mistris (^Arthur^) , here comes her husband.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] O here the wofuls husband comes aliue,
No husband now, the wight that did vphold
That name of husband is now quite orethrowne,
And I am left a haplesse Widower.
   [$ (^Old Ar.^) $] Faine would I speake, if griefe would suffer    #
me.
   [$ (^Old Lus.^) $] As Maister (^Arthur^) sayes, so say I,
If griefe would let me, I would weeping die,
To be thus haplesse in my aged yeares,
O I would speake, but my words melt to teares.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] Go in, go in, and view the sweetest Course
That ere was laid vpon a mournfull roome,
You cannot speake for weeping sorrowes doome.

Bad newes are rife, good tidings sildome come.                       #

[$ (^Enter Anselme.^) $] 
   [$ (^An.^) $] What frantike humor doth thus haunt my sence,
Striuing to breed destruction in my spirit?
When I would sleepe, the ghost of my sweete loue,
Appeares vnto me in an Angels shape,
When I am wake, my phantasie presents
As in a glasse, the shadow of my loue:
When I would speake, her name intrudes it selfe
Into the perfect ecchoes of my speech.
And though my thought beget some other word,
Yet will my tongue speake nothing but her name:
If I do meditate it is on her, 
If dreame on her, or if discourse on her,
I thinke her ghost doth haunt me, as in times
Of former darknesse old wiues tales report,
[$ (^Enter Fuller.^) $] 
Here comes my bitter Genius, whose aduice
Directs me still in all my actions.
How now, from whence come you?
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Faith from the street, in which as I past by,
I met the modest Mistris (^Arthurs^) Course:
And after her as mourners, first her husband,
Next Iustice (^Reason^) , then old M. (^Arthur^) ,
Old M. (^Lusam^) , and young (^Lusam^) too,
With many other kinsfolks, neighbours, friends,
And others that lament her Funerall,
Her bodie is by this laid in the vault.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] And in that vault my bodie I will lay,
I prithee leaue me, thither is my way.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] I am sure you ieast, you meane not as you say.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] No, no, Ile but go to the Church and pray.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Nay then we shall be troubled with your humor.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] As euer thou didst loue me, or as euer
<P H2R>
Thou didst delight in my societie,
By all the rights of friendship, and of loue,
Let me intreat thy absence but one houre,
And at the houres end I will come to thee.
   [$ (^Ful.^) $] Nay if you wil be foolish, and past reason,
Ile wash my hands like (^Pilate^) , from thy follie,
And suffer thee in these extremities.
[$ (^Exit.^) $] 
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Now it is night, & the bright lamps of heauen
Are halfe burnt out, now bright Adelbora
Welcomes the cheerefull Day-star to the Fast,
And harmlesse stilnesse hath possest the world.
This is the Church, this hollow is the Vault,
Where the dead bodie of my Saint remaines,
And this the Coffin that inshrines her bodie,
For her bright soule is now in paradice.
My comming is with no intent of sinne,
Or to defile the bodie of the dead,
But rather take my last farewell of her,
Or languishing and dying by her side.
My ayrie soule post after hers to heauen,
First with this latest kisse I seale my loue.
Her lips are warme, and (^I^) am much deceiu'd
If that she stirre not: o` this Golgotha,
This place of dead mens bones is terrible,
Presenting fearfull apparitions.
[$ (^Mistresse Arthur in the Tombe.^) $]
It is some spirit that in the Coffin lies,
And makes my haire start vp an end with feare,
Come to thy selfe faint heart, she sits vpright,
O (^I^) would hide me, but (^I^) know not where;
Tush if it be a spirit, tis a good spirit,
For with her bodie liuing, ill she knew not,
And with her bodie dead, ill cannot meddle.
<P H2V>   
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Who am I? or where am (^I^) ?
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] O she speakes, and by her language now (^I^) know
she liues.
   [$ (^Mi. Ar.^) $] O who can tell me where (^I^) am become?
For in this darknes I haue lost my selfe,
(^I^) am not dead, for I haue sence and life,
How come (^I^) then in this Coffin buried?
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] (^Anselme^) be bold she liues, and Destinie
Hath traind thee hither to redeeme her life.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Liues any mongst these dead? none but my self.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] O yes, a man whose heart till now was dead,
Liues and suruiues at your returne to life:
Nay start not, (^I^) am (^Anselme^) , one who long
Hath doted on your faire perfection,
And louing you more then became me well,
Was hither sent by some strange prouidence,
To bring you from these hollow vaults below,
To be a liuer in the world againe.
   [$ (^Mis Ar.^) $] (^I^) vnderstand you, and I thanke the heauens,
That sent you to reuiue me from this feare,
And I embrace my safetie with good will.
[$ (^Enter Aminadab with two or three boyes.^) $] 
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] (^ (\Mane Citus lectum fuge mollem discute somnum,
Templa petas supplex & venerarum deum.\) ^)
Shake off thy sleepe, get vp betimes, go to the church and pray,
And neuer feare, God wil thee heare, & keepe thee all the day.
Good counsel boyes, obserue it, marke it well,
This early rising, this (\diliculo\) ,
Is good both for your bodies and your minds.
Tis not yet day, giue me my Tinder-box,
Mean time vnloose your sachels & your bookes,
Draw, draw, and take you to your lessons boyes.
   [$ (^1. Boy.^) $] O Lord M. whats that in the white sheete?
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] In the white sheete my boy, (^ (\Dic vbi\) ^) ,    #
where?
<P H3R>
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] (^ (\Vide\) ^) Maister, (^ (\vide illic\) ^) there.
   [$ (^Ami.^) $] O (^ (\Domine, Domine\) ^) , keep vs from euill,
A charme from flesh, the world, & the diuell.
[$ (^Exeunt running.^) $] 
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] O tel me not my husband was ingrate,
Or that he did attempt to poyson me,
Or that he laid me here, and I was dead,
These are no meanes at all to win my loue.
   [$ (^Ans.^) $] Sweet Mistris, he bequath'd you to the earth,
You promis'd him to be his wife till death,
And you haue kept your promise, but now since
The world, your husba~d, & your friends suppose
That you are dead, grant me but one request,
And I will sweare neuer to sollicite more,
Your sacred thoughts to my dishonest loue.
   [$ (^Mis Ar.^) $] So your demand may be no preiudise
To my chast name, no wrong vnto my husband,
No sute that may concern my Wedlock breach,
I yeeld vnto it, but to passe the bands of modestie & chastitie,
First will (^I^) bequeath my selfe againe
Vnto this graue, and neuer part from hence,
Then taint my soule with blacke impuritie.
   [$ (^An.^) $] Take here my hand & faithful hart to gage,
That I will neuer tempt you more to sinne:
This my request is, since your husband doates
Vpon a leaud lasciuious Curtezan,
Since he hath broke the bands of your chaste bed,
And like a murderer sent you to your graue,
Do but go with me to my mothers house,
There shall you liue in secret for a space,
Onely to see the end of such leaud lust,
And know the difference of a chaste wifes bed,
And one whose life is in all loosenesse led.
   [$ (^Mis. Ar.^) $] Your mother is a vertuous Matron held,
<P H3V>
Her counsell, conference, and companie,
May much auaile me, there a space Ile stay,
Vpon condition as you said before,
You neuer will moue your vnchaste sute more.
   [$ (^An.^) $] My faith is pawnd, o` neuer had chaste wife,
A husband of so leaud and vnchast life. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $] 
[$ (^Enter Marie Brabo, and Splay.^) $] 
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] Mistris I long haue seru'd you, euen since
These bristled hayres vpon my graue like chin
Were all vnborne: when (^I^) first came to you
These Infant feathers of these rauens wings,
Were not once begunne.
   [$ (^Spl.^) $] No indeed they were not.
   [$ (^Bra.^) $] Now in my two Muchatoes for a need,
Wanting a rope, I well could hang my selfe:
I prithee Mistris, for all my long seruice,
For all the loue that I haue borne thee long,
Do me this fauour now to marry me.
[$ (^Enter young Arthur.^) $]
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] Marry come vp you blockhead, you great asse,
What wouldst thou haue me marie with a diuel,
But peace, no more, here comes the silly foole
That we so long haue set our lime-twigs for,
Be gone, and leaue me to intangle him.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] What Mistris (^Mary^) !
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] O good maister (^Arthur^) , where haue you bene this
weeke, this moneth, this yeare?
This yeare said I? where haue you bene this age?
Vnto a Louer euery minute seemes time out of minde.
How should (^I^) thinke you loue me,
That can indure to stay so long from me?
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] In faith sweet heart I saw thee yesternight.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] I true, you did, but since you saw me not,
at twelue a clocke you parted from my house,
<P H4R>
And now tis morning, and new strucken seuen.
Seuen houres thou staidst fro~ me, why didst thou so?
They are my seuen yeares Prentiship of woe.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] I prithee be patient, (^I^) had some occasion
That did inforce me from thee yesternight.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] I you are soone inforc'd, foole that I am,
To dote on one that nought respecteth me:
Tis but my fortune, I am borne to beare it,
And euerie one shall haue their destinie.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] Nay weepe not wench, thou woundst mee
with thy teares.
   [$ (^Mary.^) $] I am a foole, and so you make me too,
These teares were better kept, then spent in waste,
On one that neither tenders them nor me:
What remedie, but if I chance to die,
Or to miscarrie with that I go withall,
Ile take my death that thou art cause thereof.
You told me, that when your wife was dead,
You would forsake all others, and take me.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] I told thee so, & I will keep my word,
And for that end I came thus early to thee:
I haue procur'd a licence, and this night
We will be married in a lawlesse Church.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] These newes reuiue me, & do somewhat ease
The thought that was new gotten to my heart.
But shall it be to night?
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] (^I^) wench, to night. 
A sennet and odde dayes since my wife died
Is past alreadie, and her timelesse death,
Is but a nine daies talke, come go with me,
And it shall be dispatched presently.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] Nay then I see thou louest me, & I finde
By this last motio~, thou art growne more kinde.
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] My loue and kindnesse like my age shal grow,
<P H4V>
And with the time increase, and thou shalt see,
The older (^I^) grow, the kinder (^I^) will bee.
   [$ (^Ma.^) $] (^I^) so (^I^) hope it will, but as for mine,
That with my age shall day by day decline.
Come, shall we goe?
   [$ (^Yong Ar.^) $] With thee to the worlds end.
Whose beautie most admire, and all commend.
