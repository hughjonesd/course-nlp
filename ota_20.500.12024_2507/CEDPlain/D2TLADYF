<P 332C2>
   [$ (^L. H. S.^) $] My Lords, the Reason why you be
call'd hither this day, is to sit as Peers of (^Frances^)
Countess of (^Somerset^) .
   [$Mr. (^Fenshaw,^) (^Clerk of the Crown^) .$] (^Frances^)
Countess of (^Somerset^) , hold up thy Hand.
   [$She does so, and held it up till Mr. Lieutenant
told her she might put it down; and then he read
the Indictment, containing (^Weston's^) Accounts, in
the poisoning of Sir (^Thomas Overbury^) , and her
abetting of him, the 8th of (^May^) 1613.
   The Countess of (^Somerset^) , all the while the
Indictment was reading, stood, looking pale,
trembled, and shed some few Tears; and at the first
naming of (^Weston^) in the Indictment, put her Fan
before her Face, and there held it half cover'd till
the Indictment was read.$]
   [$Mr. (^Fenshaw.^) $] (^Frances^) Countess of (^Somerset^) , what
sayst thou? Art thou guilty of this Felony and
Murder, or not guilty?
   [$The Lady (^Somerset^) making an Obeisance to the
Lord High Steward, answer'd$] Guilty, [$with a low
Voice, but wonderful fearful.
   My Lady, upon her Arraignment, having
pleaded Guilty, the Proceeding after was thus:$]
[^ATTORNEY'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED.^]
<P 333C2>
[^ATTORNEY REFERS TO THE KING'S INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING THE CASE.^]
   [$ (^Mr. Attorney.^) $] There be other Directions in these
Instructions, by way of Interrogatories, that are
not now necessary to be read.
   [$ (^L. H. S.^) $] Let the Lords the Peers view these 
Directions from the King.
   [$ (^Ld. Coke.^) $] None of these Interrogatories which
the King desired there should be Examinations
upon, came away empty; and whatsoever
Whisperings there be abroad of the Death of (^Weston^) ,
they all (some before the hour of their Death)
confess'd the Fact, and died penitent; and if need
should require, I have brought their Confessor
along, (namely, Dr. (^Whyting^) .)
   [$ (^L. H. S.^) $] My Lords, you see, and have heard those
Directions under the King's Hand; give the Glory
to God, and Honour to the King.
   [$ (^Mr. Attorney.^) $] May it please your Grace, (^&c.^)
whereas (^Frances^) Countess of (^Somerset^) hath been
indicted as Accessary before the Fact, of the
wilful Poisoning and Murder of Sir (^Thomas Overbury^) ;
upon her Indictment, she hath been arraign'd;
upon her Arraignment, pleaded guilty: I desire that
her Confession may be recorded, and Judgment
given against the Prisoner.
   [$ (^Fenshaw.^) $] (^Frances^) Countess of (^Somerset^) , hold up
thine Hand: Whereas thou hast been indicted,
arraign'd, and pleaded guilty, as Accessary before
the Fact, of the wilful Poisoning and Murder of
Sir (^Thomas Overbury^) ; what canst thou now say for
thy self, why Judgment of Death should not be
pronounced against thee?
   [$ (^C. of Som.^) $] I can much aggravate, but nothing
extenuate my Fault; I desire Mercy, and that the
Lords will intercede for me to the King. [$ (This she
spake humbly, fearfully, and so low, the Lord
Steward could not hear it, but Mr. Attorney
related it.) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Attorney.^) $] The Lady is so touch'd with
Remorse and Sense of her Fault, that Grief surprizes
her from expressing of her self; but that which she
<P 334C1>
hath confusedly said, is to this effect, That she
cannot excuse herself, but desires Mercy.
   [$Sir (^Richard Conningsby^) sitting before the Lord
High Steward, rises, and upon his Knee delivers
him the White Staff.$]
   [$ (^L. H. S.^) $] (^Frances^) Countess of (^Somerset^) , whereas
thou hast been indicted, arraigned, pleaded guilty,
and that thou hast nothing to say for thy self, it is
now my part to pronounce Judgment; only thus
much before, Since my Lords have heard with
<P 334C2>
what Humility and Grief you have confessed the
Fact, I do not doubt they will signify so much to
the King, and mediate for his Grace towards you:
but in the mean time, according to the Law, the
Sentence must be this, That thou shalt be carried
from hence to the Tower of (^London^) , and from
thence to the place of Execution, where you are
to be hang'd by the Neck till you be dead; and
the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.
