[$ (^Enter^) Constantia (^ (\sola\) , with a letter in her hand^) .$]

   [$ (^Const.^) $] In this disguise, ere scarce my mourning robes,
Could haue a generall note, I haue forsooke
My shape, my mother, and those rich demeanes,
Of which I am sole heyre: and now resolue,
In this disguise of Page to follow him,
Whose loue first caus'd me to assume this shape.
Lord how my feminine bloud stirs at the sight
Of these same breeches, me thinkes this cod-peece
Should betray mee: well, I will trye the worst,
Hether they say hee vsually doth come,
Whom I so much affect, what makes he heere,
In the skirts of (^Holborne^) , so neere the field,
And at a garden house, a has some punke
Vpon my life: no more heere he comes.
[$ (^Enter^) Boutcher.$]
God saue you sir: your name vnlesse I erre,
Is maister (^Thomas Boutcher^) . [$ (^Bou.^) $] 'Tis sweet boy.
   [$ (^Con.^) $] I haue a letter for you. [$ (^Con. deliuers the    #
lett.^) $] [$ (^Bou.^) $] From whom ist,
   [$ (^Con.^) $] The inside sir will tell you; I shall see
What loue he beares me now. [$ (^hee reads it.^) $]                  #
[$ (^Bou.^) $] Th'art welcome boy.
How does the faire (^Constantia Somerfield^) ,
My noble mistresse. [$ (^Con.^) $] I left her in health.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] Shee giues thee heere good words, and for her sake,
Thou shalt not want a maister, be mine for euer.
   [$ (^Con.^) $] I thanke you sir: now shall I see the Punke.       #
[$ (^he knocks.^) $]
[$ (^Enter William Small-shanke.^) $]
   [$ (^W. Sm.^) $] Who knocks so fast? I thought 'twas you, what    #
news,
   [$ (^Bout.^) $] You know my businesse well, I sing one song.
   [$ (^W. Sm.^) $] Foot, what would you haue me do, my land is gon,
My credit of lesse trust then Courtiers words,
To men of iudgment, and for my debts
I might deserue a Knight-hood; what's to be done?
The Knight my father will not once vouchsafe
To call me sonne; That little land a gaue,
<P A3V>
(^Throte^) the Lawyer swallowed at one gob
For lesse then halfe the worth: and for the Citty
There be so many rascals, and tall yeomen
VVould hang vpon me for their maintenance,
Should I but peepe or step within the gates,
That I am forst onely to ease my charge,
To liue here in the suburbes: or in the towne
To walke in (^Tenebris^) . I tell you sir,
Your best retired life is an honest Punke
In a thatcht house with Garlike: tell not mee,
My Punk's my Punke, and noble Letchery
Sticks by a man, when all his friends forsake him.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] The Poxe it will, art thou so sencelesse growne,
So much indeared to thy bestiall lust,
That thy originall worth should lye extinct
And buried in thy shame? farre be such thoughts
From spirits free and noble: begin to liue.
Know thy selfe, and whence thou art deriu'd,
I know that competent state thy father gaue,
Cannot be yet consum'd. [$W. S.$] 'Tis gon by heauen,
Not a denier is left. [$ (^Bou.^) $] 'Tis impossible.
   [$VV. S.$] Impossible zart, I haue had two suckers,
Able to spend the wealthy (^Croesus^) store.
[$ (^Enter Francis,^) $]
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] VVhat are they? [$VV. S.$] VVhy a Lawyer & a       #
VVhore,
See heere comes one, doost thinke this petti-coate,
A perfu'md smock, and twice a weeke a bathe,
Can be maintain'd with halfe a yeares reuenews
No by heauen, wee Annuall yonger brothers,
Must go to't by hole-sale, by hole-sale man
These creatures are maintain'd: her very face
Has cost a hundred pound. [$ (^Fra.^) $] Sir, thanke your selfe.
   [$ (^Con.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Cou.^) ^] They keepe this whore   #
betwixt them. [$ (^Fra.^) $] You know sir, 
I did inioy a quiet country life,
Spotlesse and free, till you corrupted mee,
And brought me to the Court, I neuer knew,
VVhat sleeking, glazing, or what pressing meant,
Till you preferd me to your Aunt the Lady,
I knew no Iuorie teeth, no caps of heire,
<P A4R>
No (^Mercurie^) water, (^fucas^) , or perfumes,
To helpe a Ladies breath, vntill your Aunt
Learnt me the common trick. [$ (^W. S.^) $] The common trick
Say you, a poxe vpon such common tricks,
They will vndoe vs all. [$ (^Bou.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Gou.^) ^]    #
And knowing this
Art thou so wilfull blind, still to persist
In ruine and defame? [$ (^W. S.^) $] VVhat should I doe?
I'aue past my word to keepe this Gentlewoman,
Till I can place her to her owne content.
And what is a Gentleman but his word.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] Why let her goe to seruice. [$ (^W. S.^) $] To     #
seruice,
Why so shee does, she is my Landeresse,
And by this light, no punie Inne a Court
But keepes a Landresse at his command
To doe him seruice, and shall not I, ha!
   [$ (^Fra.^) $] Sir, you are his friend (I loue him to)
Propound a course which may aduantage him,
And you shall finde such reall worth in me,
That rather then Ile liue his hindrance,
I will assume the most penurious state
The Citty yeelds, to giue me meanes of life.
   [$W. S.$] Why ther's it, you heare her what she sayes,
VVould not he be damnd that should forsake her,
Sayes she not well, can you propound a course,
To get my forfit land, from yonder roague,
Parcell Lawyer, parcell Deuill, all Knaue,
(^Throate, throate^) . [$ (^Bou.^) $] Not I. [$W. S.$] Why so, I     #
thought as much,
You are like our Cittizens to men in need,
VVhich cry 'tis pitty, a propper Gentleman
Should want mony, yet not an vsuring slaue,
VVill lend him a denier, to helpe his wants,
VVill you lend me forty shillings. [$ (^Bou.^) $] I will.
   [$ (^VV. S.^) $] VVhy God-amercy, there's some goodnesse in thee,
Youle not repent. [$ (^Bou.^) $] I will not. [$W. S.$] With that     #
money
I will redeeme my forfit land, and wed
My Coccatrice to a man of worship,
To a man of worship by this light. [$ (^Bou.^) $] But how?
   [$VV.$] Thus: in Ramme-alley lies a fellow, by name
(^Throate^) : one that professeth law, but indeed
<P A4V>
Has neither law nor conscience, a fellow
That neuer saw the barre, but when his life
Was cald in question for a coosenage,
The Rogue is riche, to him go you, tell him
That rich Sir (^Iohn Somerfield^) . [$ (^Con.^) $] How's that?
   [$ (^W.^) $] Is lately dead, and that my hopes stand faire
To get his onely daughter. If I speed,
And haue but meanes to steale away the wench,
Tell him I reckon him my chiefest friend,
To entertaine vs till our nuptiall rites
May be accomplisht, and could you but procure
My elder brother meete me on the way,
And but associate [^SOURCE TEXT: associaie^] me vnto his house,
'Tweare hit ifaith, I'de giue my cunning (^Throte^)
An honest slit for all his tricks in lawe.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] Why this shall be perform'd, take ther's my store,
To friends all things are common. [$ (^W. S.^) $] Then at the court 
There are none foes, for all things there are common.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] I will as carefully performe thy wish,
As if my fortunes lay vpon th'attempt.
   [$ (^W. S.^) $] When shall I heere from you.                      #
[$ (^Bou.^) $] Within this houre
   [$ (^W. S.^) $] Let me alone for the rest, if I gull not
And go beyond my open throted lawyer,
For all his booke cases of (^ (\Tricesimo nono\) ^)
And (^ (\Quaaragessimo octauo\) ^) ; let mee
Like waiting Gentlewomen be euer bound,
To sit vpon my heeles, and pick rushes,
Will you about this geere. [$ (^Bou.^) $] With my best speed.
   [$ (^W. S.^) $] Then fare you well, yole meete me.                #
[$ (^Bou.^) $] Without faile.
[$ (^Exit. Bouch.^) and (^Page^) .$]
   [$ (^W. S.^) $] Adue: now you pernicious Coccatrice,
You see how I must skelder for your good,
Ile bring you where you shall haue meanes to cheate,
If you haue grace enough to apprehend it.
   [$ (^Fra.^) $] Beleeue me loue, how ere some stricter wits,
Condemne all women which are prone to loue,
And thinke that if their fauour fall on any,
By consequence they must be naught with many,
And hold a false position, that a woman
<P B1R>
False to her selfe, can trusty be to no man,
Yet know I say, how ere my life hath lost
The same which my Virginity aspyr'd,
I will be true to thee, my deed shall mooue,
To win from all men pitty, if not loue.
   [$ (^W. S.^) $] Tut, I know thee a good rascall, lets in,
And on with all your neate and finest ragges.
On with your cloake and saue-guard, you arrant drab,
You must cheate without all conscience, filtch for thee & me.
Do but thou act what I shall well contriue,
Weele teach my Lawyer a new way to thriue. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
[$ (^Enter Mistresse^) Tafata, (^and^) Adriana (^her maid aboue^) .$]
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] Come lou'd (^Adriana^) heere let vs sit,
And marke who passes; now for a wager,
What colourd bear'd comes next by the window?
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] A black mans I thinke. [$ (^Taf.^) $] I thinke not #
so,
I thinke a redde, for that is most in fashion,
Lord how scarce is the world of propper men
And gallants; sure wee neuer more shall see
A good legge worne in a long silke stocking,
With a long cod-peece, of all fashions
That carried it ifaith, what's he goes by?
[$ (^Enter a Cittizen.^) $]
   [$ (^Adri.^) $] A sniueling Cittizen, he is carrying ware,        #
[$ (^Exit.^) $]
Vnto some Ladies chamber: but who's this?
[$ (^Enter^) T. Smal-shanke (^reading a letter^) .$]
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] I know him not, a lookes iust like a foole.
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] He's very braue a may be a Courtier,
Whats that a reads. [$ (^Taf.^) $] Ah how light a treads
For durting his silke stockings, Ile tell thee what,
A witty woman may with ease distinguish,
All men by their noses, as thus: your nose
(^Tuscan^) is louely, large and brawde,
Much like a Goose, your valiant generous nose,
A crooked, smooth, and a great puffing nose,
Your schollers nose is very fresh and raw
For want of fire in winter, and quickly smels,
His choppes of mutton, in his dish of porrage.
Your Puritan nose is very sharpe and long,
<P B1V>
And much like your widdows, and with ease can smell,
An edefying capon some fiue streets off,
[$ (^Enter Boutcher and Constantia.^) $]
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] O mistris a very proper Gentleman,
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] And trust me so it is, I neuer saw
A man that sooner could captiue my thoughts
(Since I writ widdow) then this gentleman,
I would a would looke vp. [$ (^Adr.^) $] Ile laugh so lowd
That he may heere me. [$ (^Taf.^) $] Thats not so good.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] And spake you with Maister (^Smalshanke^) .        #
[$ (^Con.^) $] I did.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] Will a meete his brother. [$ (^Con.^) $] A said a  #
would,
And I beleeued him, I tell you maister
I haue done that for many of these gallants
That no man in this towne would do but I.
   [$ (^Bo.^) $] What is that boy. [$ (^Con.^) $] Why trust them on  #
their words,
But will you heare the newes which now supplies,
The citty with discourse. [$ (^Bou.^) $] What is it wag.
   [$ (^Con.^) $] This sir, they say some of our citty dames
Were much desirous to see the Baboones
Doe their newest tricks, went, saw them, came home,
Went to bed, slept, next morning one of them,
Being to shift a smock, sends downe her maide,
To warme her one, meane while she gins to thinke
On the Baboones tricks, and naked in her bed
Begins to practise some, at last she stroue,
To get her right leg ouer her head; thus:
And by her actiuity she got it
Crosse her shoulder: but not withall her power,
Could she reduce it, at last much strugling
Tumbles quite from the bed vpon the flower,
The maide by this return'd with the warme smock,
And seeing her mistris throwne on the ground,
Trust vp like a foote-ball, exclaimes, calls helpe,
Runnes downe amazd, sweares that her mistris neck
Is broke; vp comes her husband and neighbours,
And finding her thus trus'd, some flatly said
She was bewitch, others she was possest,
A third said for her pride, the Diuell had set
Her face where her rumpe should stand, but at last
<P B2R>
Her valiant husband steps me boldly to her,
Helpes her; she ashamed [^SOURCE TEXT: a shamed^] ; her husband      #
amazed,
The neighbours laughing, as none forbeare,
She tells them of the fatall accident.
To which one answers, that if her husband
Would leaue his trade, and carry his wife about
To doe this tricke in publike, she'd get more gold
Then all the Baboones, Calues with two tailes,
Or motions whatsoeuer. [$ (^Bou.^) $] You are a wag.
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] He will be gone if we neglect to stay him.
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] Shall I cough or sneeze. [$ (^Taf.^) $] No I ha't  #
stand a side,
Aye me my handkercher (^Adrian, Fabian^) . [$ (^Adr.^) $] Mistris,
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] Runne, runne, I haue let my handkercher fall,
Gentleman shall I intreate a curtesie?
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] Within my power your beauty shall command.
What curtesie ist. [$ (^Taf.^) $] To stoope and take vp,
My handkercher. [$ (^Bou.^) $] Your desire is performd.
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] Sir most hearty thankes: please you come in
Your welcome shall transcend your expectation.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] I accept your curtesie, ha! whats this?
Assaild by feare and hope in a moment.
(^Boucher^) , this womanish passion fits not men,
Who know the worth of freedome: shall smiles and eyes
With their lasciuious glances conquer him
Hath still beene Lord of his affections?
Shall simpring nisenesse load-stones but to fooles,
Attract a knowing spirit? it shall, it dooes,
Not (^Phoebus^) rising from (^Auroras^) lap,
Spreds his bright raies with more maiestique grace,
Then came the glances from her quickning eye,
And what of this.
   [$ (^Con.^) $] By my troth I know not.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] I will not enter: continued flames burne strong.
I yet am free, and reason keepes her seate,
Aboue all fond affections, yet is she faire.
[$ (^Enter Adrian.^) $]
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] Sir I bring you thankes for this great curtesie,
And if you please to enter I dare presume,
My mistrisse will affoord you gratious welcome,
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] How do men call your mistris. [$ (^Con.^) $] The   #
mans in loue.
<P B2V>
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] Her name sir is Mistris (^Changeable^) , late wife
To maister (^Tafata^) Mercer deceast.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] I haue heard she is both rich and beautifull,
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] In th'eyes of such as loue her, iudge your selfe,
Please you but prick forward and enter.
   [$ (^Con.^) $] Now will I fall a boord the waiting maide,
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] Fall a boord of me doost take me for a ship?
   [$ (^Con.^) $] I, and will shoote you betwixt wind and water.
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] Blurt maister gunner, your linstocks too short.
   [$ (^Con.^) $] Foote how did she know that, dost here sweet heart,
Should not the page be doing with the maid,
Whilst the maister is busie with the mistris,
Please you prick forwards, thou art a wench
Likely to goe the way of all flesh shortly.
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] Whose witty knaue art thou. [$ (^Con.^) $] At your #
seruice.
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] At mine faith, I should breetch thee.              #
[$ (^Con.^) $] How breetch me.
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] I breech thee, I haue breech'd a taler man,
Then you in my time, come in and welcome.
   [$ (^Con.^) $] Well I see now a ritch well-practis'd baud,
May pursse more fees in a summers progresse,
Then a well traded lawyer in a whole terme,
Pandarisme! why't is growne a liberall science
Or a new sect, and the good professors
Will like the Brownist frequent grauell pits shortly,
For they vse woods and obscure holes already.
[$ (^Enter Tafata and Boucher.^) $]
Not marry a widdow. [$ (^Bou.^) $] No. [$ (^Taf.^) $] And why?
Belike you thinke it base and seruant-like,
To feed vpon reuersion, you hold vs widdowes,
But as a pie thrust to the lower end
That hath had many fingers int before,
And is reseru'd for grose and hungry stomacks.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] You much mistake me. [$ (^Taf.^) $] Come in faith  #
you do:
And let me tell you thats but ceremony,
For though the Pye bee broken vp before,
Yet sayes the prouerbe, the deeper is the sweeter.
And though a capons wings and legges be caru'd,
The flesh left with the rumpe I hope is sweet.
I tell you sir, I haue beene woed, and sued to,
<P B3R>
By worthy Knights of faire demeanes: nay more,
They haue bin out of debt, yet till this houre,
I neither could endure, to be in loue
Or be beloued, but proferd ware is cheape.
Whats lawfull thats loathd, and things denied,
Are with more stronger appetite persude:
I am too yeelding. [$ (^Bou.^) $] You mistake my thoughts:
But know thou wonder of this continent,
By one more skild in vnknowne fate, then was,
The blind (^Achaian^) Prophet, It was foretold,
A widdow should indanger both my life,
My soule, my lands, and reputation.
This checks my thoughts, and cooles th'ssentiall fire,
Of sacred loue; more ardent in my brest
Then speech can vtter. [$ (^Taf.^) $] A triuiall Idle ieast,
Tis for a man, of your repute and note,
To credit fortune-tellers, a petty rogue,
That neuer saw fiue shillings in a heape,
Will take vpon him to diuine mens fate,
Yet neuer knowes himselfe shall dye a begger,
Or be hanged vp for pilfering table-cloaths,
Shirts and smocks, hanged out to dry on hedges,
Tis meerely base, to trust them, or if there be,
A man in whom the (^Delphick^) God hath breath'd
His true diuining fire; that can foretell,
The fixt decree of fate, he likewise knowes,
What is within the euerlasting booke
Of Desteny decreed, cannot by wit,
Or mans Inuention be disolued, or shund,
Then giue thy loue free scope, imbrace and kisse,
And to the distafe sisters leaue th'euent.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] How powerfull are their words whom we affect,
Small force shall need, to win the strongest fort,
If to his state the Captaine be perfidious,
I must intreate you licence my depart
For some few houres. [$ (^Taf.^) $] Choose what you will of time,
There lyes your way. [$ (^Bou.^) $] I will intreate her, stay,
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] Did you call sir. [$ (^Bou.^) $] No.               #
[$ (^Taf.^) $] Then fare you well.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] Who gins to loue, needs not a second Hell.         #
[$ (^Ent. Adr.^) $]
<P B3V>
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] (^Adriana^) , makes a no stay.                     #
[$ (^Adr.^) $] Mistris.
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] I prythee see if hee haue left the house,
Peepe close, see, but be not seene: is a gon.
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] No, has made a stand. [$ (^Taf.^) $] I prethee     #
keep close.
   [$ (^Ad.^) $] Nay, keep you close, y'ad best [$ (^Taf^) $] What   #
does he now?
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] Now a retires. [$ (^Bou.^) $] O you much partiall  #
gods!
Why gaue you men affections, and not a power
To gouerne them? what I by fate should shun,
I most affect, a widdow, a widdow.
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] Blowes the wind there. [$ (^Adr.^) $] A ha, h'is   #
in ifaith,
Yo'aue drawne him now within your purlews mistresse.
   [$ (^Bou.^) $] Tut I will not loue, my rationall
And better parts shall conquer blind affections,
Let passion children, or weake women sway,
My loue shall to my iudgment still obay.
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] What does he now? [$ (^Adr.^) $] H'is gon.         #
[$ (^Taf.^) $] Gon (^Adriana^) .
   [$ (^Adr.^) $] A went his way, and neuer lookt behind him.
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] Sure he's taken. [$ (^Adr.^) $] A little sing'd or #
so,
Each thing must haue beginning, men must prepare
Before they can come on, and show their loues
In pleasing sort: the man will doe in time,
For loue good Mistresse is much like to waxe,
The more 'tis [^SOURCE TEXT: 'tls^] rub'd, it sticks the faster too,
Or like a bird in bird-lime, or a pit-fall,
The moore a labours, still the deeper in.
   [$ (^Taf.^) $] Come, thou must helpe me now, I haue a trick
To second this beginning, and in the nick,
To strike it dead ifaith, women must woe, 
When men forget what Nature leads them too.

   [$ (^Thr.^) $] Negatiue to all. The plaintiue sayes,
That (^William Goose^) , was sonne to (^Thomas Goose^) ,
And will a sweare the generall bill is false.

trusse my points,
And how thinkst thou of law? [$ (^Das.^) $] Most reuerently,
Law is the worlds great light, a second sunne,
To this terrestriall Globe, by which all things
Haue life and being, and without which
Confusion and disorder soone would seaze
The generall state of men, warres, outrages,
The vlcerous deeds of peace, it curbes and cures,
It is the kingdomes eye, by which shee sees
The acts and thoughts of men. [$ (^Thr.^) $] The kingdomes eye,
I tell thee foole, it is the kingdomes nose,
By which she smels out all these rich transgressors,
Nor ist of flesh, but meerely made of wax,

You are no trewant in the law, I see.

As to a man on whom a may relye
His life and fortunes: you hath a named
Already for the Steward of his lands,
To keepe his Courts, and to collect his rent,
To let out Leases and to raise his fines,
Nothing that may, or loue, of profit bring,
But you are named the man. [$ (^Thr.^) $] I am his slaue,
And bound vnto his noble curtesie,
Euen with my life, I euer said a would thriue,
And I protest I kept his forfeit morgage,
To let him know what tis to liue in want.

My Maister goes to bed and cannot tell
What money's in his hose, I ere next day

For that tis knowne that most of your Gallants

What money's in their hose, but if they haue,
There is no other helpe [^SOURCE TEXT: kelpe^] then sweare the page
And put him to his oath. [$ (^Con.^) $] Then fecks-law,

Has not a conscience likewise to deny.
Then hang him vp ifaith. [$ (^Bou.^) $] I must meet him,

My doores stand open and all within is theirs,
And though Ramme-alley stinks with Cookes and Ale,

An honest maide, and which is most of all,

Comming once late by an Inne of Chancerie;
Was laid along, and mufled in his cloake,
His wife tooke in, Stycht vp, turnd out againe,
And he perswaded all was but in iest,
Tut those braue boyes are, gone, these which are left,
Are wary lads, liue poring on their bookes,
And giue their lynnen to their landresses,
By tayle, they now can saue their purses,
