<P 18>
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] Mr. (^Arnold^) I would know one thing,
will you undertake to Swear positively that this
Person was one of the Persons who stept before you?
Will you take it upon your Oath, That the Person, the
Prisoner at the Bar, went before you?
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] I will take it upon my Oath as far as
a Man can do, for one Man, 'tis possible, may be
like another both by his Voice and his Face; I can
Swear I believe he is the man.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson.^) $] You are Satisfied upon the first Sight
<P 19>
that you had of him in the Countrey, that he was the
Man.
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] Yes Sir, and he can tell you that by a
very good token, for I had like to have run him
through.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] We must not expect that there can be
exact and positive Proof, for men that commit Offences
of this Impudent Nature, don't usually call Witnesses
to be present to see them done; therefore we would
come as near as we can to Circumstances, whereby
a Fact of such a Nature is to be proved. Mr. (^Arnold^) ,
Do you believe that the Prisoner at the Bar was one
of the Persons that went before you in (^Bell-Yard^) .
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] Upon my Conscience I do believe he
was the Man.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] What a Clock was it?
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] About Eleven a Clock, or between Ten
and Eleven.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] When the Link came there, was there
Three, and do you believe by the Light you had
by the Link that that was one of the Persons that
was there.
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] I saw his Face and Habit, and believe
he was.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] What Habit had he on?
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] He had a Grey Cloak, a Compaign
Cloak and a Coat, I think Lin'd with Red. It is
impossible to give an Account of every particular
under those Circumstances I was in.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] It is not to be expected that a man under
your Circumstances, should be extraordinary precise
in Circumstances; therefore it is I asked you, that
according to the best of your Apprehension, you might
acquaint the Court with those Circumstances that
may be remembred by the Jury, that they may see
there be no Injury done to the Prisoner at the Bar;
but that Right be done on both sides, and that in
every Circumstance.
   [$Mr. (^Holt.^) $] Now Sir we will call Mr. (^Phillips^) , with
whom he had this Discourse the next day.
<P 20>
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] Will the Prisoner ask him any Questions?
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Truly Mr. (^Arnold^) knew me in
(^Monmouth-shire^) , and knew me as well as any man in the City.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] Did you not very well know him?
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] It is very possible I might see him, and
often at Assizes and Sessions, but not to know him, 
nor did ever know whether his Name were (^Giles^) , or
what it was. Your Lordship sees many Persons here
and often, and it's possible do not know them; he
lives I think a Dozen Miles from me.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] That's a wonder; If it please you, Sir, my
Wife is a near Relation to you, both by Father and
Mother, and I have spoken with you in your
Chamber.
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] 'Tis possible she may, but I do not
know it.

[}STEPHEN PHILLIPS.}]

   [$Mr. (^Holt.^) $] Pray Mr. (^Phillips^) give an Account of what
Discourse you had with (^Giles^) the day after the
business was done.
   [$Mr. (^Phillips.^) $] We went to the Tavern, and drank
Two or Three Bottles of Wine, and we had some
Discourse concerning Mr. (^Arnold^) ; it was about Eight
or Nine a Clock in the Evening the next day. Some
Discourse happen'd concerning his miserable
Condition, and how he was hurt, and of that Nature.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] How many was there in Company?
   [$Mr. (^Phillips.^) $] One or Two more.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] What House?
   [$Mr. (^Phillips.^) $] At the (^Crown Tavern^) in (^New-street^) in
(^Covent Garden^) , and among the rest Mr. (^Giles^) was
talking of it, and said he, (^God Dam him, God Rot him,
he had Armour on^) , the word was, (^God Dam him^) , or, (^God
Rot him, he had Armour on; they say^) .
   [$Mr. (^Holt.^) $] What time of Night was that?
   [$Mr. (^Phillips.^) $] As near as I can remember, it was
about Eight or Nine the next day in the Evening.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson.^) $] The very words that Mr. (^Arnold^)
Swears when they went to Cut his Throat.
<P 21>
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] My Lord, If you please, there was Mr.
(^Phillips^) , and another, and I spake nothing but what
I heard as News, that they had killed him if he had
not on Armour.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] For that matter Mr. (^Giles^) , you shall
have your time, and you may call up other Witnesses,
but the Gentleman positively Swears you said these
words; and if so, I'll assure you, it does not look
as if you were a Kin to him, or your Wife 
either.

[}WALTER WATKINS.}]
 
   [$Mr. (^Holt.^) $] Mr, (^Watkins^) . What did you hear that
(^Giles^) should say in (^Glocester-shire^) about this Business?
   [$Mr. (^Thompson.^) $] What said he about this business of
Mr. (^Arnold^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Watkins.^) $] My Lord, All I can say is this, I being
at the Stating some Accounts between Mr. (^John Giles^)
and Mr. (^Richmond^) : I asked Mr. (^Giles^) for some 
Horse-hair to make a Fishing-line. Mr (^Giles^) replyed, (^That
he had left very good Hair for me at a Farriers in^) 
Glocester, (^for he and Mr.^) Herbert Jones (^made such haste
through the Town of^) Glocester (^that they did not call for
the Horse-hair^) . I asked Mr. (^Giles^) what was the
occasion of his haste? Said he, (^For fear we shou'd be stopt in
our Journey, as suspected to be concerned in Mr.^) Arnold's
(^Business^) .
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] What time was that?
   [$Mr. (^Watkins.^) $] About the 5th of (^May^) .

[}GEORGE RICHMOND.}] 

   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] Mr. (^Richmond^) , What can you say
concerning this thing?
   [$Mr. (^Richmond.^) $] I desired Mr. (^Giles^) to meet me, that
we might even our Accounts, and upon the 5th of
(^May^) last he met me, and I desired Mr. (^Watkins^) to be
present as a Witness.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] Where was it.?
<P 22>
   [$Mr. (^Richmond.^) $] At (^Uske^) , And as we were making
up the Account, said Mr. (^Watkins^) to Mr. (^Giles^) , (^Where
is the Horse-hair you promised me to make Fishing-lines^) ?
(^Giles^) replyed, He left very good Horse-hair at a
Farriers in (^Glocester^) : And he asked him why he left
it? He said he made hast for fear of being taken and
stopt for Mr. (^Arnold's^) business. I cannot say whether
he call'd him Esq; (^Arnold^) , or Mr. (^Arnold^) , or what; he
seldom used to give him so good words.

[}WALTER POWEL.}] 

   [$Mr. (^Holt.^) $] What do you know concerning (^Giles's^) 
being at the Cutlers?
   [$Mr. (^Powel.^) $] If it please you, Sir, (^I^) was at the       #
Cutlers.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] Name the time when, and the place
where.
   [$ (^Powel.^) $] The 5th of (^May^) , at a place called (^Uske^) in
(^Monmouthshire^) , Mr. (^Giles^) and (^I^) , we came there, and
Mr. (^Giles^) asked (^Peter Darcy^) , Whether he would mend
him that Sword or no? But Mr. (^Darcy^) had some
business that he could not get time to mend it that
morning, but would do it in the afternoon. Says (^Darcy^) ,
Where have you been, you have been hot at it? What
have you been Fighting with the Devil? No, said he,
with damn'd (^Arnold^) .
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] What did you say when the Cutler asked
him, Whether he had been fighting with the Devil?
and he said again no, not with the Devil, but with
damn'd (^Arnold^) ?
   [$ (^Powel.^) $] (^Peter Darcy^) said he must not speak such
words, and (^Giles's^) Wife pluckt him by the Coat and
bid him hold his Tongue.
   [$Mr. (^Darnal.^) $] Who was by?
   [$ (^Powel.^) $] There was one (^Peter Darcy^) .
   [$Mr. (^Darnal.^) $] Was one (^John Jones^) there?
   [$ (^Powel.^) $] I think there was another indeed by the
Apprentice.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] There was the Apprentice, but he does
not know his Name, and (^Darcy^) , and (^Giles^) , and his
Wife.
<P 23>
[}WILLIAM RICHMOND.}]

   [$Mr. (^Holt.^) $] What did you hear (^Giles^) say about the
Rapier?
   [$ (^William Richmond.^) $] He asked me in the Afternoon
before Mr. (^Arnold^) was hurt, Where he might buy
a very good Rapier? (^I^) told him (^I^) could not tell,
He had then a good Back-Sword in the House.
   [$Mr. (^Gibbs.^) $] Tell the Court what Acquaintance
(^Giles^) had with Father (^Lewis^) the Jesuite since
Executed.
   [$ (^William Richmond.^) $] My Lord he told me he wou'd
go to the Executioner and perswade him not to
Execute Mr. (^Lewis^) , but (^I^) had the Executioner lockt
up, and (^I^) would not suffer him; but (^I^) did see him
very active at the Execution, a dipping cloaths in (^Lewis^)
his Blood.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson.^) $] What do you say as to his coming
to his Lodging?
   [$Mr. (^Richmond.^) $] We went to several places that day,
and at Eight or Nine, or between Eight and Nine,
we came to the (^Kings Arms^) in St. (^Martins-lane^) , and (^I^)
left him at the Kitchin Fire, and went up into the
Chamber, and drank a considerable quantity of
drink; and as near as I can guess, it was between
Twelve and One a Clock before he came to his Bed:
for after I was going to Bed, about One of the Clock,
I heard (^John Giles^) come up the Stairs, and bid me
Good-night; he called at my door just as I was
pulling off my Breeches to go into Bed.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] What time was this?
   [$ (^William Richmond.^) $] As near as I can guess it was
between Twelve and One, or very near One.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] At what House was it?
   [$ (^William Richmond.^) $] The (^Kings Arms^) in St. 
(^Martins-lane^) .
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] What did you say when the Maid was
making the Bed.
   [$ (^William Richmond.^) $] I asked her who it was for? And
<P 24>
she said for a Man that was not willing to lie with
any Body.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] What time did you come to the House?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond.^) $] About Nine.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Did you stay in that House till that time?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond.^) $] I lay in the House Sir.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] You were not out of the House all the
while?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond.^) $] No Sir, I was not out of it.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] And you are sure that you did not see him
again till he came to your door going to Bed?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond.^) $] Yes Sir.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] What time was that?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond.^) $] Nigh One.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson.^) $] You see the Contradiction between
this, and what this Fellow says upon his
Examination, where he says he was a-bed at Nine a Clock.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Where did you go at that time?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond.^) $] We went to (^Long-lane^) to one
(^Philpots^) , and she told us her Husband was gone to
Exercise at the next Church; I do not know the
Churche's Name, and there we went and looked
upon the Souldiers, but did not see him. We came
back to his House again, and the Gentlewoman gave
us a Tankard of Beer, or Ale. And after that we went
back, and we had a mind to make sport with a
Countrey Fellow we had with us, and went into
(^Whetstones-Park^) , from thence we went to the (^Helmet^) in
(^Drury-lane^) .
   [$ (^Record.^) $] You went to (^Whetstones Park^) , and what did
you spend there?
   [$ (^VVill. Richmond.^) $] Six Pence and he paid it.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Whether did you go from thence?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond.^) $] Into (^Drury-lane^) .
   [$ (^Record.^) $] How long did you stay in (^Drury-lane^) ?
   [$ (^VVill. Richmond.^) $] It was not long Sir, about an hour.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Where after that?
   [$ (^VVill. Richmond.^) $] From thence to the (^Peacock^) and staid
till Eight or Nine.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Who did you meet withall between your 
<P 25>
going from the (^Helmet^) in (^Drury-lane^) to the (^Peacock^) ?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond.^) $] We met with one (^Powel^) and
another, and one (^Elizabeth Edwards^) .
   [$ (^Record.^) $] What did you drink there?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond,^) $] We did drink both Ale and
Brandy.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Well said, how long did you stay there?
   [$ (^VVill. Richmond,^) $] We staid there a pretty while, an
hour or more, or two hours.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] What time of Night was it that you went
from thence?
   [$ (^VVill. Richmond,^) $] About Eight or Nine.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] And then you went to your Lodgings?
   [$ (^VVill. Richmond,^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Did you Drink at the (^Kings Arms^) ?
   [$ (^VVill. Richmond,^) $] No, we drank not all together.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] And there you stay'd till Twelve or One
a Clock?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond,^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] But can you remember, as near as you
can guess what time was it you saw this Maid
making of the Bed?
   [$ (^Will. Richmond,^) $] I cannot say positively, but I judge
it was about Twelve a Clock.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] As to that Circumstance of his
coming home at Twelve at Night, desire Mr. (^Arnold^) to
give an Account of his Examination, what time of
Night he came to his Lodging.
   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] Do you believe that is (^John Giles's^) hand?
   [$ (^Record,^) $] That is a Copy.
   [$Mr. (^Arnold.^) $] He did confess before a Justice of the
Peace that he was at his Lodging at Ten a Clock:
This I heard him say, and I believe he won't deny
it; and I heard him own this Examination; my Man
will prove it.
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) $] Deny it? Yes I will deny it, there was
no such word said: I did say, Mr. (^Arnold^) , I went
to Bed then.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] The Jury must take notice of this, That
upon his Examination, he says, he came home by
<P 26>
Nine; which is before the thing was done: but by
proof he did not come in till Twelve, which was
after the thing was done.
   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] We will give you now Gentlemen an
Account of this Mans Principles.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] This is the business, (^Richmond^) says, They
came together to their Lodging before Night, but
he left him at the Kitchin-Fire, and went into
another Room to drink with some company; and this
Mr. (^Richmond^) says his Bed was not made till Twelve
a Clock, and that he himself went to Bed about
One of the Clock, and that he heard the Prisoner
at the Bar while he was pulling off his Breeches,
call to him, and therefore he took notice of that as
a Circumstance; that he does particularly
remember he did not go to Bed till that time; and he says
he did not stir from that place after Nine a Clock.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] There is a Contradiction in that.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] There is no Contradiction: The other
Witness says that he came along with him at Nine a
Clock.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] I will tell you where this is a
Contradiction.
   [$ (^Att. General,^) $] He says he came to the House at Nine
a Clock, but he came not to Bed till after One.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] The Evidence does not go so far:
(^Richmond^) says they came to the (^Kings-Arms^) , and left
him in the Kitchin at Nine a Clock, and he went
into his Chamber and staid up till One, and all that
time he did not come to Bed.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] So far it lies upon him to give an
Account where he was between Nine and Twelve.

[}BRIDGES.}]

   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] Heark you Sir, have you had any
Discourse with (^Giles^) concerning the Plot, and
concerning the Lords in the Tower? And what did he say
to you?
<P 27>
   [$Mr. (^Bridges,^) $] I had some Discourse with him
concerning the Papists, he said that it was the best
Religion, and that those that were not of that
Religion should be Damn'd: I alledged against him, and
told him the contrary: I thought not. Can it be
such a Religion said I, that will Act such things
against the King and the Government? Says he, If
any says there is such a Plot against the King or the
Government, he is a Rogue, and a Thief.
   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] What did he say of the Lords in the
(^Tower^) ?
   [$ (^Bridges,^) $] Nothing more.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] How long ago was this?
   [$ (^Record.^) $] When was this?
   [$ (^Bridges,^) $] This was, my Lord, about a Twelve Month
ago.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] Did he speak any thing to you
further concerning the Plot?
   [$ (^Bridges,^) $] Not further.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] My Lord, I beseech you I may speak to this
man, Do you hear, Sir, Were not these the words
that I said when you charged me to be a Papist, That
I knew of no Popish Plot, and they that said I was
a Papist, or knew any of the Plot, were Rogues or
Whores, or worse.
   [$ (^Bridges,^) $] You said thus, That the Papists were the
best Religion, and that those that were not of that
Religion were Damn'd.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] Have not you been a Papist Sir?
   [$ (^Bridges,^) $] I am not now.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] Will you say that I am a Papist?
   [$ (^Bridges,^) $] I say you defended it so much I thought
you were. Said I, I wonder it being such a good
Religion, that they vvould offer to Act such a thing
against the King and Government. Said he, He that
says this Plot is Acted by the Papists, is a Rogue and
a Thief.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] How long ago is this?
   [$ (^Bridges,^) $] A Twelve Month ago; you remember it
well enough; you remember when you sent for me
to the (^George^) .
<P 28>
[}WALTER MOOR.}]

   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] What discourse have you had with him
concerning the Plot.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] What has he said about it?
   [$ (^Moor,^) $] He said, If the Lords in the Tower were
Executed, there would be a greater War than ever was
in (^England^) ; and swore that if these Lords were put
to death, it would cost more Blood then ever was spilt.
And I asked him again, Why they should not be put 
to death if they should deserve it? For if a poor Man
had done such a Fault, he would be hanged out of
the way presently. He said again, They did not deserve
it, for there was no Plot at all.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] Pray Sir, Who was with you when you say
I said these words?
   [$ (^Moor,^) $] I was at (^George Taylers^) House.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] Did not you say that (^George Tayler^)
discoursed this with you?
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] Is this the man that spake it, upon
your Oath?
   [$ (^Moor,^) $] Yes this was the man.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] What did (^Tayler^) say to you? Do you think
my Lord, I would say such a thing to such a man
as this is?
   [$ (^Recorder,^) $] Do you hear Mr. (^Giles^) , for that matter
it is not the question, the man has sworn it, except
the Jury know of their own knowledge that the man
is perjured, he is not so as to me.
   [$ (^Moor,^) $] It is the first time that I ever took an Oath.

[}MR. REYNOLD.}]

   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] Mr. (^Reynold^) , What have you heard (^Giles^)
say concerning Mr. (^Arnold^) ?
   [$ (^Reynold,^) $] Sir I vvas in Company vvith (^John Giles^)
and another, and vve had discourse concerning one
(^Arnold^) , and (^John Giles^) said --
<P 29>
   [$ (^Recorder,^) $] What was that?
   [$ (^Reynold,^) $] I being in company with him, we fell
in Discourse about Justice (^Arnold^) , how he was
Wounded.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Where was it?
   [$ (^Reyn.^) $] In (^Monmouthshire^) , at (^Langoone^) , the      #
second day
of (^May^) : (^John Giles^) answered us, That he could not
see but he wounded himself.
   [$ (^Recorder,^) $] What day do you say?
   [$ (^Reynold^) $] The Second day of (^May^) .
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] He did Discourse the 5th day of (^May^) at
(^Uske^) , I would faign know when he came through
(^Glocester^) .
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] What did he say about Mr. (^Arnold^) ?
   [$ (^Reynold,^) $] He thought that he wounded himself,
says his Wife, How could he wound himself in his
Arms? Said he, It was himself or some of his Friends.
   [$ (^Recorder.^) $] Or some of his Relations.
   [$ (^Reynold.^) $] Some of his Friends.

[}MR. HOBBS.}]

   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] Mr. (^Hobbs^) , Pray tell how you found
Mr. (^Arnold^) when he was Wounded.
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] I found Mr. (^Arnold^) Bleeding.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] Tell what Wounds there were.
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] Two in his Arm, Two others upon
the Face, another upon the Throat, which bled very
much; another two upon the Breast, and one in
the Belly.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] What depth might that be?
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] Two Inches and an half long.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] Where else?
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] There was another upon his Breast.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] What depth?
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] They were not very deep, but there
was one upon the Belly Six Inches and an half; there
was Two through his Arm, and a Wound and
several Bruises in his Head.
<P 30>
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] This is likely to be a fine Contrivance,
that he should do it himself, as likely as that Sir
(^Edmundbury Godfrey^) put his own Sword through his
Body after his Neck was broke. [$A great shout given.$]
   [$L. (^Mayor^) $] Do you believe a man could wound
himself so?
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] No Sir.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] I believe a man could do it, but I believe 
a man would not do it to himself.
   [$Fifteen or Sixteen Witnesses more for the King,
that were attending in the Court were not Examin'd,
the Court being in some haste, and the King's
Council not pressing to have them Examin'd, there being
so full Evidence: nor was there one word replied
to the Prisoners Witnesses, they being all either
frivolous or contradictory.$]
[^LONG SPEECH OF MR. DARNAL, COUNCIL FOR THE PRISONER, OMITTED.
HE STATES THAT THE EVIDENCE JUST GIVEN BY THE WITNESSES WILL NOW
BE DISPROVED BY THE TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESSES FOR THE DEFENCE.^]
<P 32>
[}MR. PHILPOT.}]

   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] Mr. (^Philpot^) , Pray do you Acquaint
my Lord and the Jury, what Discourse past
between you and (^Giles^) at the (^Crown^) Tavern in (^Covent
Garden^) .
   [$Mr. (^Philpot,^) $] We drank one Bottle of (^Clarret^) ,
Mr. (^Phillips^) came in when the Bottle was almost
ended. But by and by some Friends came in, and
they asked him, What News, Sir? Said he, I hear of
no News but a cruel Assassination upon Mr. (^Arnold^) ,
but for my part I am sorry for it: But, said he, if
any thing should be upon Mr. (^Arnold^) , it is a very
strange thing.
   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] Were you there all the time Sir?
   [$Mr. (^Phil.^) $] Yes Sir, all the time.
   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] And you heard no other Discourse?
   [$Mr. (^Phil.^) $] No he did not say Dam him, nor Sink
him, for I hate such Company.
   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] Mr. (^John Philpot^) where do you live?
   [$Mr. (^Philpot,^) $] In (^Long-lane^) .
   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] What Sign do you live at?
   [$Mr. (^Philpot,^) $] At the (^Crown^) .
   [$Mr. (^Holt,^) $] What Trade are you?
   [$Mr. (^Phil.^) $] A (^Salesman^) .
   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] Now we will go on to the Discourse
at (^Uske^) , about their passing with such speed through
(^Glocester^) .
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Mr. (^Darnal^) , They do not pretend you
were in great fear, but they say you said so. It is
not the Question, Whether you did stay long at
(^Glocester^) or no? But the Question is, Whether you told
this man so? Because the man asked you, Why you
would leave the Hair at the Farriers in order to a
Fishing-line? Truly I was in great haste, for fear I
should be taken up about the business of Mr. (^Arnold^) .
   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] It is very true, and therefore we bring
this Evidence to shew the Improbability that we
<P 33>
should say any such thing when it was false, and
especially when it was to accuse our selves of a 
Crime.

[}HERBERT JONES MAYOR OF MONMOUTH.}]

   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] Mr. (^Jones^) , Pray give an Account to
the Jury of your passing through (^Glocester^) , and how
long you staid there.
   [$Mr. (^Jones,^) $] My Lord, I came with the Prisoner.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] What day did you come through (^Glocester^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Jones,^) $] I cannot positively tell you the day,
we went out of Town upon Friday, we came to
(^Glocester^) , either Wednesday or Friday, and there we
went to the (^Old-Bear^) in (^Glocester^) , and there staid an
hour before we went to Dinner, it was a publick
time, the Quarterly Sessions, and several People
came to us to hear the News, we told them, and
were as sorry for it as any Persons could be, and
did confess it a very ill thing. We went from the
(^Old-Bear^) after we had Din'd to the (^New-Bear^) , and
drank several Pints of Cyder. I believe by the Oath
I have taken, we were several hours in the Town.
   [$Mr. (^Milbourn,^) $] Do you know Mr. (^Arnold^) is
acquainted with Mr. (^Giles^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Jones,^) $] I do believe Mr. (^Arnold^) has great
reason to be acquainted with (^Giles^) .
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] Yes now he has.
   [$Mr. (^Mil.^) $] Was he chief Constable?
   [$Mr. (^Jones,^) $] Yes he was, and certainly Mr. (^Arnold^)
in Reason would take notice of the Chief Constable.
   [$Mr. (^Mil.^) $] Mr. (^Herbert Jones^) , I am informed that
you know this Gentleman goes to Church, and
receives the Sacrament. Give an account what
Religion he is of.
   [$Mr. (^Jones,^) $] Always a Protestant, I saw him at
Church within this half year.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] I can shew a Certificate of my going to
Church, since I came to Town.
<P 34>
   [$ (^Record.^) $] There are many people that can go to
Church to serve their turn.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] And my Lord I have taken the Oaths of
Allegiance and Supremacy.
   [$Mr. (^Thompson,^) $] An excellent Protestant to Discourse
so of the Plot, I must needs say that.

[}JOHN JONES THE CUTLERS APPRENTICE.}]

   [$ (^Record.^) $] How old are you?
   [$ (^Jones,^) $] Between 15, and 16.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Hark you, do you know the danger of
forswearing your self?
   [$ (^Jones,^) $] Yes Sir.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] What is it?
   [$ (^Jones,^) $] I am in danger of Everlasting Fire.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Very well.
   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] My Lord this is the Apprentice to the
Cutler, in whose Shop (^Powel^) says we had such 
Discourse: (^Jones^) pray tell my Lord, and the Jury
whether you were by, when one (^Walter Powel^)
came into your Masters Shop, when he and (^Giles^)
were talking about (^Giles^) his Sword.
   [$ (^Jones,^) $] Sir, (^John Giles^) , came in the morning, and
brought a Sword, my Master was not within, and
he told me, give this Sword to your Master to be
mended; so I took the Sword, and laid it up till
my Master came in; when he came in, I told my
Master of it, and when he came again this (^Walter
Powel^) was in the Shop, said (^Giles^) to my Master,
(^Did you mend my Sword^) ? says he; says my Master, (^Mr.^)
Giles, (^How came your Sword broke? Have you been
fighting with the Devil? No^) , says he, (^for he never 
met with^) Arnold.
   [$ (^Peo.^) $] Hiss 'm Hiss.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] It does not become the Decency and
Gravity of a Court of Justice, to be humming and
hissing, when Facts are Trying of this great
Concernment.
<P 35>
   [$Mr. (^Mil.^) $] It was the common discourse there,
That Mr. (^Arnold^) had been Assaulted.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] You have been in a great Combat, have
you been fighting with the Devil? What did he
say to that?
   [$ (^Jones,^) $] He never met with (^Arnold^) , my Master
asked him, Mr. (^Giles^) , (^Have you been in some Battle or
other? Have you been fighting with the Devil? No^) , Sir,
(^for I never met with^) Arnold.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] You did not hear his Wife bid him hold
his Tongue.
   [$ (^Jones,^) $] No Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Thom.^) $] Did he tell you how he did break his
Sword?
   [$ (^Jones,^) $] No Sir.
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] My Lord, here is Mr. (^Philpott^) can tell,
that I was sitting down in a Chair, and broke off
a piece of the Guard.
   [$Mr. (^Thom.^) $] You will do well to prove it Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Mil.^) $] Was there any Discourse in the
Countrey about Mr. (^Arnold^) ?
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Did they not talk any thing about Killing
the Devil?
   [$ (^Jones,^) $] No Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Darn.^) $] If your Lordship pleases we will call
Witnesses to give an Account when we came to
Town, and where we were all that day; and we
will call the Maid that Lockt the Chamber door
after we were in bed, on the same Night when this
Fact was committed.

[}JOHN HOWEL.}]

   [$Mr. (^Darn.^) $] (^John Howel^) , Pray tell my Lord and the
Jury when (^Giles^) came to Town?

<P 36>
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Who is thy Master?
   [$ (^Howel,^) $] (^William Richmond.^)

when you heard him call to your Master, and bid
him good Night.
   [$ (^Howel,^) $] About 11, or 12 a Clock.
   [$Mr. (^Mil.^) $] You say about Nine, you were at your
Lodging with him, did your party company with
him?
   [$ (^How.^) $] Yes Sir, we did.
   [$Mr. (^Thom.^) $] Where did you go at that time?
   [$ (^Howel,^) $] We went into the Chamber, and drank
Two Pints of Brandy.
   [$Mr. (^Thom.^) $] What time of Night was that?
   [$ (^Record.^) $] After Two Pints of Brandy, I wonder
how he can remember any thing.

[}ANN BERON.}]

   [$Mr. (^Mil.^) $] Tell what time of the Night (^Giles^) came
in, where you were in his company; what time of
Night it was?

thou wer't at home: When was this?
   [$ (^Ann.^) $] The Thursday after (^Easter^) .

Thursday in the next Week?
   [$ (^Ann.^) $] The Thursday in (^Easter^) Week; we were

his Lodging I believe it was near Ten a Clock.

Arms^) ?

   [$ (^Record.^) $] Good Woman, did you go with him to

   [$ (^Record.^) $] Were you with him in (^Drury-lane^) ?
   [$ (^Ann.^) $] No Not I.
<P 37>
   [$ (^Record.^) $] He did not go out of your Company at
all?
   [$ (^Ann.^) $] Yes about Ten a Clock.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Woman you must be mistaken, he came
to Town at Twelve or One, and might be in
thy company, but it is plain he went to a Brokers
in (^Long-lane^) , and so to the (^Artillery-Ground^) at
(^Cripple-Gate^) , for I guess it might be so: Then they went
to (^Whetstones-Park^) , and spent Six-Pence, and after
that they went into (^Drury-lane^) .
   [$ (^Giles,^) $] My Lord, she don't say she was with us
all the while, but we came to an House where she
was, and several other People our Neighbours.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] She says you did go out sometime: Now
see whether I mistake you.
   [$ (^Ann.^) $] Yes you do mistake me.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] He went out, did he?
   [$ (^Ann.^) $] Yes he went out after we came into the City,
he and some others, and then they came back to me
again in two or three hours.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Then you were two or three hours at
Dinner. Now I ask you, After they came back, was
you with him all the while?
   [$ (^Ann,^) $] Yes that I was.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Where was it?
   [$ (^Ann,^) $] At the (^Peacock^) .
   [$ (^Record.^) $] That is the place in (^Drury-lane^) .
   [$ (^Ann.^) $] No, indeed, it is in (^Covent Garden^) .
   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] When did he go to Bed, do you
know that upon your Oath?
   [$ (^Ann,^) $] We were in the Inn between Nine and Ten
a Clock, nearer Ten then Nine, and I saw him
sitting taking a Pipe of Tobacco.
   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] What time was that?
   [$ (^Ann,^) $] A little after Ten I believe.
   [$Mr. (^Thomp.^) $] He sat there till he was call'd away to
do his business.
<P 38>

Lord and the Jury about what time (^Giles^) went to
Bed?
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] Indeed Sir, he went to Bed between Ten
and Eleven.
   [$Mr. (^Darnal,^) $] How long was it that he came to his
Lodging before that? Can you say how long he was
in the House before he went to Bed?
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] I asked him if I should take away his Candle,
he said he would put his Candle out, but I might
Lock him in, and take the Key; but I did not do it.
   [$Mr. (^Thomps.^) $] Did he go to Bed as soon as he came

into it? What time did you make the Bed upon your 
Oath?
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] I made the Bed about Ten a Clock.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] I ask you, do you remember (^Richmond^)
came into you and asked you any thing about making
the Bed? Do you remember he was in the Chamber?
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] In whose Chamber?
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Did (^Richmond^) come in when you were
making the Bed?
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] He was not there that I knew of.
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Was not I in the Chamber when you made 
the Bed?
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] No, I don't remember you.
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] My Lord, when this Maid went to make the
Bed, I went into the Room after her, and had some
discourse with her, we lean'd together upon the 
<P 39>
Window, and I told her I was in Love with her, I told

   [$ (^Giles,^) $] Mr. (^Arnold^) , Pray do not laugh at my
Witnesses and make May-Games at them, it is not the
part of a Gentleman.
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] And she told me that he would lie by 
himself though the house was very full.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Do you remember any such Discourse?
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] I do remember that Mr. (^Richmond^) did come
in.
   [$ (^Kings Coun.^) $] What time of Night was it that he
was making love to you?
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] I think about Ten a Clock.
   [$ (^Kings Coun.^) $] Time passed merrily away with you
then.
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] It was Twelve a Clock.
   [$ (^Crook,^) $] Why do you say so? Our house was all
quiet presently after Eleven.
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Why will you say so? Were not we
Singing and Roaring together?
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Come don't be angry, you were not
angry when you were making love together?
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] I am not angry indeed Sir.

you saw him in the Kitchin, and here is a Maid saw
him go to Bed at Eleven.
   [$ (^Record.^) $] Have you any more? You know the
matter that was the occasion of the dispute t'other day
I would not by any means, that in a Cause of this
publick Concern [^SOURCE TEXT: Coneern^] , there should be any       #
pretence for
any to say they were surprized; therefore call as
