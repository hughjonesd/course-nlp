TEXT: A COFFEE-HOUSE DIALOGUE: OR A DISCOURSE BETWEEN CAPTAIN Y---- 
AND A YOUNG BARRESTER OF THE MIDDLE-TEMPLE; WITH SOME REFLECTIONS UPON 
THE BILL AGAINST THE D. OF Y.
(LONDON.
1679)
PP. 1.9 - 4.15^]

[^NO TITLE PAGE: TITLE TAKEN FROM HEADING ON PAGE 1.^]

<P 1>
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] A Young Lawyer come amongst us! perhaps you may   #
learn something; I have
been telling these young Gentlemen you see with me by what means I
could make this Kingdom the most Flourishing Kingdom in the whole
World.
   [$ (^P.^) $] I am sorry [^SOURCE TEXT: sotry^] I am come to late  #
to hear how so good an Effect might be so easily wrought.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Nay Sir, you are not come too late, for I can      #
(without any weariness) sit here to tell
it all day long, I so greatly desire the Publick Good. In short Sir, #
what I have been saying is
this; I can plainly demonstrate how we may beat the (^Dutch^)        #
without fighting, pay Debts
without Money, make all the Streets in (^London^) Navigable Rivers,  #
harbour all the King's Great
Ships upon the top of an Hill, where they shall be secured from Wind #
and Weather, and from
an hundred other Accidents they are else obnoxious to. All or most   #
of this you may see
printed in a Book of mine, which I know you Lawyers are against,     #
because it likewise
maintains a Register, which spoils your Trade; but to be Friends     #
with you, though I have undone
you in the First Part, I have a Second Part waiting at the Press,    #
that will maintain you all
sumptuously, if there were ten times as many more as there are; what #
say you to all this
young Lawyer, Ha?
   [$ (^P.^) $] I say you have out stripp'd all the Poets that ever  #
wrote and that 'tis pity the King
and Council should have no more regard to your Person and            #
Discourses, than wise man have
for (^Mountebanks^) .
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Sir the Reason's plain why they mind the           #
Improvement of the Nation no more;
heark you, the Great ones have another sort of Game to play; -- no   #
more of that --
you understand me.
   [$ (^P.^) $] Not I, I profess; I cannot be reconcil'd to half a   #
Sentence join'd with a little
push, a wink, a nod, a smile, or a Finger held up to the Nose; I     #
have hated those sort of
tricks, ever since I've read my Lord (^Bacon's Essays^) , where,     #
under the Title of seeming wise
(he saith) such persons help themselves with Countenance and         #
Gesture, and are wise by signs,
and when they know within themselves, they speak of that they do not #
well know, would
nevertheless seem to others to know of that which they may not well  #
speak. Therefore Sir, if
you would do any good upon me, you must speak, and not leave me to   #
conjecture what you
can say.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Psha! I see you do not know the World: pray read   #
this Paper.
   [$ (^P.^) $] A Club to consist of threescore Lords and Gentlemen  #
[^SOURCE TEXT: Genletmen^] . (^ (\Imprimis\) ^) , They shall be      #
called (^the 
Improvers of^) England. (^Item^) , They shall meet twice in the      #
week. (^Item^) . They shall have
provided for them a pennyworth of Cheese, Bread, Beer and Mustard. A #
brave Treat for Lords
<P 2>
I confess! I'le read no more, unless you tell me how this Paper is   #
pertinent to our former
Discourse.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] This is to satisfie you, that I am not only one    #
that seem wise; for I was Chair-man
of the Club, and I tell you, there were some there under my          #
Instructions, would have
baffled all the Coife; therefore whate're you may think on me, you   # 
see some Ingenious
Gentlemen have thought me fit to be their Instructor.
   [$ (^P.^) $] That any Ingenious man desired you to be Chair-man,  #
is more than I know, or ever heard
on before; But pray Sir no more of that! Tell me what you mean by    #
saying (^The Great Ones
have another Game to play^) .
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] You will understand it too soon, I am sure I       #
foresaw what's now coming upon us,
before you was born. -- We are a lost People -- a lost People! An    #
undone Nation, An 
undone Nation!
   [$ (^P.^) $] Still more Riddles! Good Captain what's the matter?  #
What's the City on Fire at one
end, and are they cutting Throats at the other?
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] You may sport at these things, you are but a young #
man, and cannot see so far as I
do: that Priest yonder, can tell you, 'twill not be long before you  #
must burn, unless you are
resolved (as he is) to turn.
   [$ (^P.^) $] Do you know that Gentleman?
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] No, I never saw the man before.
   [$ (^P.^) $] How can you pretend to be acquainted with his        #
Resolves?
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] What do you talk of pretend? pray who does not     #
know that all the Clergy of the
Church of (^England^) (as you phrase it) are a Pack of -- I know what?
   [$ (^P.^) $] What do you mean by (^I know what^) ? for my part I  #
am very well satisfied, if you did
know what they were, you would speak of them with as much Reverence, #
as you do Detraction.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Psha! I tell you they are all a parcel of          #
Self-interested Fellows, and Papists in their Hearts.
   [$ (^P.^) $] I perceive you are such an Enemy to Prerogative,     #
that you'l encroach even upon the
Almighty's, and not suffer him to monopolize the knowledge of        #
Hearts; but how ignorant, as
well as impious this Affirmation is, will appear: for how can they   #
be self-interested, and for
Popery? for if that comes in, there will a great many come to share  #
with them in their
Spiritual Livings.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] You are a young man, and run too fast; for any one #
knows, if Popery gets once the
upper hand, all the Lands taken from the Church in (^H.^) 8. time    #
will be restored again; though
some therefore doe come to share with them, yet their Advantages     #
will be much greater.
   [$ (^P.^) $] You may as well say every private mans Estate will   #
be taken from him, and given to the
Church; for no man holds any Estate by a stronger Title, than the    #
Purchasers of Church-lands
hold those Lands: for first they were sold by Act of Parliament, and #
in Queen (^Maries^) Days
instead of abrogating that Act, it was corroborated by another, to   #
which the consent of his
Holiness was given; and if this be not Security strong enough, I'le  #
be content (though I confess
'twill be a great punishment) to write in Vindication of a Register. #
But Sir, to let this Slip
of yours pass, pray instruct me for what reason our worthy Divines   #
stand condemn'd in your
Judgment, for Papists?
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] For what Reasons? Why, don't all the World know    #
they are against Bringing in the
Bill, (^&c.^) and that they openly pray for the Duke?
   [$ (^P.^) $] Is this all? 
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] All! Ay and enough too.
   [$ (^P.^) $] I am sorry to see you thus hurried on by a blind     #
Zeal; for why should they not pray for
his Highness? Let him be good or bad, their Prayers are necessary;   #
if good, that he may be so
preserved, if bad, that he may be reclaim'd and converted.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] I shall not so much insist upon this; but as to    #
the other Points, I mean the Bill: I 
have a Paper in my Pocket will confound all your Divines, and all    #
your Lawyers put together;
here, do but read, and you'l be convinced.
   [$ (^P.^) $] What, it's Intituled (^A Word without Doors^) ?
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] The same.
   [$ (^P.^) $] I have read him already; but for my part, I neither  #
approve of the Man, nor his Reasons.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Not the Man! Why you don't know who 'tis.
   [$ (^P.^) $] But I know he fails in his Morals, by injuriously    #
calumniating both His Majesty, and all
the Worthy Clergy of our Church: for (^Pag. 3.^) he tells you, 'tis  #
the constant Practice of
Church-men to debauch young Gentlemen with ill Principles: and, the  #
Episcopal Sees,
Deanries, (^&c.^) were the certain and constant Rewards of such      #
Services: such Superlative Impudence
ought to be quell'd, not with a Pen, but with the Magistrates Sword. #
However, this is to be 
<P 3>
said in alleviation of his Fault, what he has spoke, is so grosly    #
false, that no one (in their Wits)
will believe him.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Pray let this alone, come to his Reasons; methinks #
you do not care to meddle with
them.
   [$ (^P.^) $] I will shew you, there is not one thing, in the      #
whole Pamphlet, worthy the name of a
Reason; For as to the first and last position, which he so much      #
endeavours to refute (and God
knows does it boldly enough) there is no need of them to maintain    #
this Cause, so that the four
first Pages and the four last, (which the Gentleman is pleased to    #
give us (^ (\ex abundanti\) ^) )
contains only a parcel of insignificant Stuff. As for his Instance   #
of (^Reboboam^) , that God said This 
thing was of Him, what then? Therefore he approved of the Action of  #
the Rebels. This
looks like the Logick of one that rails at the University. (^Is      #
there any Evil in the City, and I have
not done it^) , saith the Lord; (^ (\Ergo\) ^) he approves of the    #
afflicting Instruments. He hardned
(^Pharoah's^) Heart, that he might not let the Children of           #
(^Israel^) go; (^ (\ergo\) ^) he was pleased with
(^Pharoah^) for keeping them. A brave Divine! Indeed the Church of   #
(^England^) men and he do differ
in Opinion.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Well, but he hath other Instances.
   [$ (^P.^) $] I tell you Sir, they are all impertinent; for he     #
hath neither proved his Cases to be
parallel to ours, nor that the Actors did what they did justly; the  #
question between us, is not only
what hath, and what may be done; but what hath justly, and may       #
justly be done; for unless he
will argue, Every thing that hath been done, hath been justly done   #
(which is like his
Logick) he hath said nothing to the purpose. When he can prove that  #
(^William^) and (^Henry^) did
justly exclude (^Rob.^) who was their right and true King (^de       #
Jure^) , he will speak to the Point:
But pray observe his Reason why (^Rob.^) was put by; because         #
(^William^) was not an honest man,
not because (^Rob.^) was dishonest. What think you, is not this a    #
brave Fellow to be in Print?
I so much insist Sir, upon this Term (^justly^) ; because the        #
Supreme Authority may chance to do
something unjust: (else instead of Destroying, he'l Make Popes) for  #
they may do something
against the Divine Law. But to be short, what think you of           #
(^Strafford's^) Case? I hope we all
know that Act of Parliament was sufficiently repented of, because    #
'twas unjust. Let us see
then how it suits with our Case; (^Strafford^) received a more       #
severe punishment by that Act,
than the Laws of the Realm had provided for such Offences; this was  #
all, and here lay the
injustice of the Act. If this Bill had pass'd, the (^D.^) had        #
receiv'd more severe Punishment
for his Faults, than the Laws of the Realm have provided in such     #
Cases; either therefore, that
Act was just, or this Bill unjust. (^ (\In Tricesimo Quinto\) ^) of  #
the Queen it is with good reason
provided, if any made open Submission and Declaration of his or      #
their Conformity, that
then they shall be discharged, of and from all and every the         #
Penalties and Punishments 
inflicted. Now suppose the D. should conform: if this Bill had       #
pass'd, it had nothing availed him;
and though the meanest Subject in the Kingdom might have taken       #
Advantage by his
Conformity, yet the D. could not; a most unreasonable thing. Now     #
upon the whole matter I
appeal to any impartial man, whether this Argument will not hold:    #
All Subjects ought in
reason and justice to bear equal Punishments for equal Faults. But   #
if the Bill had pass'd, the
D. had had a more severe Punishment than any other Subject for the   #
same Fault; Therefore, (^&c.^)
We have hitherto taken it for granted the D. is a Papist, but now    #
let us see whether the
Parliament could justly (when the Bill was brought) take notice of   #
him as such; I demand
therefore, Had he been legally convicted of Popery?
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] I cannot say that.
   [$ (^P.^) $] Why then, every man is supposed innocent, till he be #
Tryed, and proved Guilty; and
I believe all people will agree to this Argument, That 'tis highly   #
unjust to Condemn any man
unheard; but if this Bill had passed, the D. had been condemned      #
unheard; therefore he had
been unjustly Condemned. 'Tis certain by the same Reason and         #
Justice, they may make a 
Law to Condemn one man unheard, they may make a Law to Condemn all   #
men unheard;
and how would you like such a Law?
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] I perceive you conclude the Duke to be guilty of   #
no other Fault but Popery;  but
alas! we all know there are a great many other Offences laid to his  #
Charge, and things
of a high Nature too -- but no more of that.
   [$ (^P.^) $] Now are we to believe you have a thundering Reserve, #
when in truth you do not
know so much as you have spoke. Suppose him Sir, to be Actor of the  #
most and 
greatest Crimes that ever mortal man was; let him (without Favour)   #
be charged with them
all; but let him be summon'd to make his Defence, and then from what #
Imputation he
cannot clear himself, let him suffer for it according to the Laws in #
such Cases: But that there
should be new Laws made to punish His particular Person only, or     #
that he should be condemn'd
<P 4>
unheard, are things I will maintain (against you and all the         #
Fanatick Crew) to be
Dissentaneous both to right Reason and Justice.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Talk what you will, I cannot believe but that the  #
Parliament may lay the next
Heir aside: for what if he should be a Fool, or a Mad-man; must we   #
be govern'd by 
him?
   [$ (^P.^) $] I begin now to be weary with your Impertinence.      #
Pray, who does not know 'tis
every man's Fate (according to Law and Reason) that is an Ideot, or  #
Mad-man to
lose the Government of his Inheritance, and this rather fortifies    #
than exonerates what
(^I^) have said: That Justice must be alike to all Subjects.         #
Therefore (^I^) hope (^I^) have
fully evinc'd, that though the Divines are against the Bill, (which  #
is more than either
you or (^I^) know) they are not for that blame-worthy.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Nay, talk as long as you will, I shall still be of #
the same mind.
   [$ (^P.^) $] Well, I see you are an obstinate, prejudic'd Man,    #
therefore (^I'le^) 
take my Leave. [^ONLY FIRST LETTER OF I'le IN ITALICS IN SOURCE
