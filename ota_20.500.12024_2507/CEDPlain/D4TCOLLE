   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Well, Mr. (^Colledge^) , will you call     #
your Witness, for I
must tell the Jury as I did at your request, concerning Mr.          #
(^Attorney^) , that
as nothing he said, so nothing you say is to be believed upon your   #
own
Allegation; for then no man would ever be guilty, if his own Purgation
by words were to be believed.

   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] My Lord, I thank God, I know my own           #
Innocency, and
hope to prove it. I have a Soul that must live to Eternity, either   #
in Joy
or Misery, I act according to those principles, and I hope I have    #
some
assurance of my own salvation when I dye, I would not call God to
Witness to a Lye, to save 1000 lives. My Lord, this is a villanous   #
Conspiracy
against me, and if it take place against me, it may go a great way,  #
God
knows how far, This is the (^17th^) or (^18th^) Sham Plot the        #
Papists have
made against the Protestants, to get over their own; but I hope my   #
Lord
God Almighty will never suffer it. If they can make me a Traytor,
they will try it upon others, and so hope to sham off their own      #
Treasons;
but I say, I hope God Almighty will never suffer it. My Lord, I think
the first Witness that swore against me was Mr. (^Dugdale^) ; and I  #
must call
my Witnesses as I have them here, I know no person of them hardly,   #
and
this that is done for my defence was done abroad. My Lord, I have
been kept close Prisoner in the (^Tower^) , and none of them         #
suffered to come
to me, whilst the Popish Lords have had the Liberty and Priviledg to
talk with their friends. Here are Witnesses I hope will prove that   #
these
are Suborned men, for (^Macnamarra^) did tell me presently after the
Parliament broke up at (^Oxon^) , and whispered it to me in the      #
Coffee-house, 
Said he, there is a Design laid to make us retract our Evidence, and #
go
over to (^Fitz Girald^) . Said I, I suppose they have been at that   #
sport a great
while. Ah, said he, they make large offers. Said I, by whom? Said he,
Colonel (^Warcupp^) hath been at me, and he tells me --

   [$ (^Mr. Just. Jones.^) $] (^Macnamarra^) is not produced against #
you as a
Witness at all.
<P 39>
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] No, but he told me this, that there was such  #
a design, and, said he, I will
get you, and some other honest men, and he desired me to be by when  #
he had
something more to tell which would do his business for him, but the  #
next news I
heard of him was, he was put into (^Newgate^) .
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Call your Witnesses, Mr. (^Colledge^) ,    #
and prove what you can.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Call Mr. (^Hickman^) .
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] My Lord, I desire he may observe the    #
same rule he desired
about our Witnesses; that he may call but one at a time.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Yes, yes, I will call them one by one.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Are not your Witnesses together? send to   #
them.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] My Lord, I don't know, I have not seen one since  #
I come. This is not
the first time, my Lord, the Papists have designed to take away my   #
Life, though it
is the first time they went about to take it away by a Law.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] I know not of one Papist that is a Witness #
against you.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] There is never a man of them, except Sir          #
(^William Jennings^) , but what was
a Papist.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] What say you to Mr. (^Masters^) ?
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Mr. (^Masters^) says nothing material, it was     #
only a jocose discourse.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] It was very pleasant discourse upon my   #
word; you were as
merry as when you were singing of the (^Rary Shew^) .
   [$Mr. (^Just. Jones.^) $] What do you make mirth of the blackest  #
Tragedy that ever
was. That horrid Rebellion, and the Murther of the late King.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] I never justified that Parliament in any such     #
thing that they did contrary to
Law.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Jones.^) $] He swears it.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] (^Hickman^) does not appear, call       #
another.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Call (^William Shewin^) , [$ (who appeared.) $]
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Look you here Friend, you are not to be    #
sworn; but when you
speak in a Court of Justice, and in a course of Justice, you must    #
speak as in the
presence of God, and only speak what is true.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] I would not have any body speak any thing for me, #
but what is truth.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Now ask him what you will.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] I don't know the Gentleman. But pray, Sir, will   #
you tell what you know
of these Witnesses.
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] Name any of them that I know, pray Sir, and  #
I'll tell you.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Do you know (^Bryan Haynes^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] I know there is such a man, but I have       #
nothing to say to him.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Do you know (^Turbervile^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Pray tell what you know of him.
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] My Lord, I was in (^Turbervile's^) Company   #
on Thursday night last at
the Golden Posts at (^Charing-cross^) , and there I heard him say,   #
that if I were at
(^Oxford^) I should hear strange things against (^Colledge^) , and   #
he would lay ten to one that
Mr. (^Bethel^) and Mr. (^Wilmore^) should be hanged at               #
(^Christmas^) , and he would lead him
by the Gold Chain along (^Fleetstreet^) , and down with his Breeches #
in the middle of
the Coffee-house, with a Band about his Neck and a Cloak.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] Did he say all these things against Mr.  #
(^Sheriff Bethel^) , I assure you
he is a bold man.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] What do you know of Mr. (^Smith^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] I know him by sight, but I have nothing in   #
particular to say
concerning him. I have something to say to (^Macnamarra^) , Sir, if  #
he were here.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Do you know any thing of this Conspiracy in       #
general?
   [$Mr. (^Jones.^) $] What of your Conspiracy?
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] I know that they did lay, who should be      #
hang'd at (^Candlemas^) , who
at (^Christmass^) , and who at several other times.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What did you hear (^Turbervile^) say?
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] Those words I spake before about Sheriff     #
(^Bethel^) , and about the
(^Amsterdam^) Coffee-house.
<P 40>
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Did they say what time I should be hang'd? for    #
the discourse 'rose about
me.
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] One told me that there was one that did      #
design to be returned
upon this Jury, that was resolved to hang him right or wrong.
   [$Mr. (^High Sher.^) $] My Lord, I did hear there was such a one, #
and I left him out
of the Jury.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] For Mr. Sheriffs honour we must take       #
notice of what he hath said.
He say, he heard of a man that spoke something of that nature, and   #
therefore he
left him out of the Jury.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Now 'tis possible these Witnesses were at the     #
same sport.
   [$Mr. (^Shewin.^) $] Was Mr. (^Peacock^) Mrs. (^Fits-harris^)     #
Maids Father, or she here, either
of them Witnesses against you?
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] No, they were not, Sir.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] They did swear against me at the finding of the   #
Bill.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] We have only called these Witnesses, if  #
you can say any thing
against them do.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Call (^Henry Hickman^) , [$ (who appeared.) $]
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Holl.^) $] Where do you live, Sir?
   [$Mr. (^Hickman.^) $] At (^Holborn-bridge^) .
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] What Trade are you?
   [$Mr. (^Hickm.^) $] A Cabinet-maker.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What do you ask him?
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Do you know (^Haynes^) ?
   [$ (^Hickm.^) $] Yes, very well; because he used to come to my    #
house to a Popish
Widow that was a Lodger in my house where I live now; and this       #
person was a
Prisoner at (^Haynes's^) when he was a Prisoner in the (^Fleet^) . I #
always had a suspicion
he was a Priest, not that I could accuse him really of any thing,    #
but he several
times using to come to my house I thought so of him, and discoursing #
with my
Land-lady.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Your Tenant you mean?
   [$Mr. (^Hickm.^) $] Yes, my Tenant. I asked her, what this fellow #
was; said she, he
is a very dangerous Fellow though he is a Papist, and I am one my    #
self, yet he is
a dangerous person, and he does not much care what he swears against #
any one.
   [$Mr. (^Just. Jones.^) $] Thus your Tenant told you, what do you  #
know your self?
   [$Mr. (^Hickm.^) $] Another time he came to speak with my Tenant  #
Mrs. (^Scot^) , who is
now gone into (^Ireland^) ; when he came to the house, he asked me,  #
is Mrs. (^Scot^)
within? Yes, said I, Mr. (^Haynes^) , she is above; and up he goes,  #
and there they
locked the door, and plucked out the key; so I slipt off my Shoes,   #
for I thought
there might be more danger from such people than I could discover    #
any other
way. So I went up stairs, and stood at the door, and hearkned,       #
hearing my
Land-lady talk something to him, he wraps out a great Oath, (^God    #
dam me^) , said
he, (^I care not what I swear, nor who I swear against; for 'tis my  #
Trade to get money by
swearing^) . Whereupon, my Lord, I came down as fast as I could, and #
a little
after I saw him go out, and as soon as my Land-lady came down, said  #
I, Mrs. (^Scot^)
I desire you would provide your self as soon as you can; I would be  #
civil to you,
and I would not put you to a Non-plus, because your Goods by the Law #
will be
seized for not departing according to the King's Proclamation. So a  #
while ago 
since this business of (^Haynes's^) swearing against my Lord of      #
(^Shaftsbury^) , I bethought
my self of some other businesses I had heard: To find out the        #
Knavery I went to
the (^Fleet^) , where he hath a very ill Character as well amongst   #
the Papists as the
Protestants. Whereupon I asked one fellow that was a kind of a       #
Porter, if he
knew any thing of him; said he, Go you to such an one --
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] We must not permit this for Example      #
sake, to tell what others
said.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Nothing is Evidence, but what you know of  #
your own knowledge;
you must not tell what others said.
   [$ (^Hickm.^) $] This I do say, I heard him say; and there are    #
those that can produce a
Letter --
<P 41>
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] Bring those people, but you must speak   #
nothing, but upon your
own knowledge.
   [$ (^Hickm.^) $] I was at the Chamber door, and looked in at the  #
Key-hole, and he sat
down at the Window.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] How long ago was it, pray?
   [$ (^Hickm.^) $] A Year and a half.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] You are an Eves-dropper, I perceive.
   [$ (^Hickm.^) $] I did not know what danger he might bring Men    #
into, because he was
a Papist. I have taken an Oath to be true to the King, and I will as #
long as I live.
For this Gentleman, I never beheld him, till last night, in all my   #
days; though
he lived by me, I never saw him.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Well, call the next.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] I never saw this Gentleman; but you see what      #
(^Haynes^) hath declared.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] This Man says, he did say so.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] And, for ought I perceive, he does accordingly.   #
Call (^Elizabeth Oliver^) .
[$ (who appeared.) $]
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Mrs. (^Oliver^) , stand up. What do you    #
ask her?
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Do you know (^Haynes^) , pray? (^Bryan Haynes^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Pray tell the Court what you know of him.
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] I know him very well.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What do you know of him?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] He writ a Letter in my Father's name,       #
unknown to my Father.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Did you see him write it?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] I saw him write it.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Read it. By whom is it subscribed?
   [$ (^Clerk.^) $] By no body.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Why, how is it written in your Father's    #
name, when it is not
subscribed at all?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] he writ it as from my Father.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] Whither did he bring it?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] He sent it into the Country.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] Can you write and read, Mistress?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] Who did he send it by?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] The Carrier.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] When is it dated?
   [$ (^Clerk.^) $] In 77.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Read the Letter. [$ (Which was done.) $]
   [$ (^Clerk.^) Reads.$]
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What is all this to the purpose? unless    #
your Father were here to
prove it was done without his knowledge.
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] My Father did not write it.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Was your Father in the Fleet then?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] Yes, my Lord, he was a Prisoner then.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Mrs. (^Oliver^) , do you know any thing more of   #
him?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] I have known him a great while; I know him  #
to be a very ill Man.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] Must she tell you all she knows?
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] Did you ever know him forswear himself?
   [$Mrs. (^Oliver.^) $] No, I do not know that.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Come, call another; this is nothing to the #
purpose.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Call Mrs. (^Hall^) : [$ (who appeared.) $] Pray,  #
do you know Mr. (^Bryan Haynes^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] Yes, if I see him I know him very well.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] What do you know of him?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] He lodged at my House, and came there the day #
before (^Fitz-harris^)
was tryed, and there was a great discourse about his Tryal, and I    #
was enquiring
of him, and I told him, I must expose my Ignorance, I did not know   #
what it was
he was tried for: And, said he, if you please to sit down, I will    #
tell you: Madam
<P 42>
(^Portsmouth^) came to him, and went upon her knees, and begg'd of   #
him, if he had
any kindness for His Majesty, that he would now shew it at this      #
juncture, and she
told him she had heard he had formerly Acquaintance with one Mr.     #
(^Everard^) abroad,
and therefore desired him to go now and renew it, and endeavour to   #
get him over;
and, if he could possibly, to get over some others to make a         #
Presbyterian Plot of
it. This is true, I very well know it: as for this Gentleman, I      #
never saw his face
before, but those were the words I am sure.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What were the words?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] That they might make a Presbyterian Plot of it.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Did he say so?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] He said that the Dutchess of (^Portsmouth^)   #
did so.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What a story is this?
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Did not he say that the Dutchess of               #
(^Portsmouth^) employed him too?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] No, this was about (^Fitz-harris^) .
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] What do you know more about (^Haynes^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] One night he had been about some business for #
me in Law with one
Mr. (^Woodward^) an Attorney at Law, and when he returned I was      #
busie in the Kitchin
with my Maid about the House, and he came up to me; Madam, said he,  #
this
night I had a Message from the King; a Justice of Peace met me, and  #
brought me
word, that the King had sent into (^Ireland^) , to enquire into the  #
Loyalty of my
Family, and he hath heard that my Father was a Loyal Subject, but he #
understood
strange things of me; but if I would come in, he would grant me my   #
Pardon. I
told him, said he, I did not value His Majesty's Pardon a Pin, for I #
had done
nothing that might make me stand in need of it; but I would do any   #
thing that might
tend to the preservation of His Majesty's Person or Honour, but to   #
do such base
things as are beneath a Man, I will never do it; and he whisper'd me #
in the ear
(as the accusing of several Persons;) and since, he sent me a Letter #
by his Mother
in Law, Mrs. (^Wingfield^) , that I should not believe it, if I      #
heard he should accuse
any body, but I might be confident he had not, nor would accuse any  #
body.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Was he to swear against the Protestants?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] I did not enquire any Questions; but he said, #
such base things he
would never do as the accusing of several Persons.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] Pray Mistress, did you believe him when #
he told you he was so
honest a Man?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] How do you mean, Sir?
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] When he said he would not do those base #
things, did you
believe him?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] I never saw his face before he came there to  #
lodge; but I saw him to
be a Man that made little Conscience what he said or swore.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] Did not you find him a bragging Man?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] I had little discourse, but what he said of   #
himself. But there is one
thing more about an Intelligence: When (^Thompson^) had written      #
something in his
Intelligence concerning (^Bryan Haynes^) , he said he would write an #
Answer to it; and
accordingly, he read it to us: he said, he was going that Evening to #
get it put
into one of the Intelligences: the words were to this purpose.       #
"Whereas one
(^Nathaniel Thompson^) had falsely and maliciously accused one       #
(^Bryan Haynes^) for speaking
Treasonable Words; he the said (^Bryan Haynes^) doth declare that he #
challenges any
Man to charge him with it: but he owned he had an hand, or was       #
employed to
put the Plot upon the dissenting Protestants." [^NO END QUOTATION

TEXT, INDICATING EACH NEW LINE OF THE QUOTATION, ARE OMITTED.^]
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Did he publish that in the Intelligence?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] I never read it published; but he had writ    #
it, and read it to us
several times.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] Do you go to Church, Mistress?
   [$Mrs. (^Hall.^) $] I hope I do.
   [$Sir (^Geo. Jeff.^) $] To what Church?
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Call (^Mary Richards^) , Mrs. (^Halls^) Maid.     #
[$ (Who stood up.) $]
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What will you ask her?
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Do you know this (^Bryan Haynes^) , pray.
<P 43>
   [$ (^Richards.^) $] Yes, he lodged there where I lived.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] What do you know of him?
   [$ (^Richards.^) $] I know he writ that in the Intelligence my    #
Mistress spoke of; (^Thomson^) ,
in his Intelligence, accusing him of having spoken Treason, he read  #
what he said
he would put into the Intelligence: That he never spake one word of  #
Treason, and
he writ it for his own vindication; that whereas (^Nathaniel         #
Thomson^) , in his
Intelligence of the 18th. of (^June^) , had maliciously accused one  #
(^Bryan Haynes^) of
Treasonable Words; there was no such thing.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] And that was to vindicate him, that he     #
never did speak any
Treasonable Words. [$ (^Richards.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] Will you ask her any thing else?
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] I cannot tell what she says.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] She says, he writ something that was in    #
Answer to (^Thomson's^)
Intelligence, to vindicate himself that he never did speak any       #
Treasonable Words.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] But did you hear him say any thing of these       #
words, that he was employed
in a Plot against the Protestants?
   [$ (^Richards.^) $] I read that, in what he writ to put in the    #
Intelligence, that he
challenged any one to appear, and charge him with Treason; but, said #
he, I own that
I was employed or had a hand in putting the Plot upon the dissenting #
Protestants:
and he telling my Mistress he had a Message from the King, offering  #
him his
Pardon; I asked him why he did not accept the King's Pardon. Alas,   #
said he, you
do not understand what I was to do for it; I was to do such base     #
things so beneath
a Man, that I will never do them: I had five hundred Pounds offered  #
me, besides
the King's Pardon, to do such base things as are beneath a Man to do.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] What were the base things he said he was to do,   #
and would not do?
   [$ (^Richards.^) $] I cannot tell, he did not say to me what they #
were.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] When was this?
   [$ (^Richards.^) $] It was a Week before he was taken.
   [$Mr. (^Attorn. Gen.^) $] That is two Months ago.
   [$ (^ Coll.^) $] It was since the Parliament sat at (^Oxford^) :  #
But what was that he was
employed to do, did he say?
   [$ (^Richards.^) $] Why, he said in his Answer to the             #
Intelligence, he was one that bad
an hand to put the Plot upon the dissenting Protestants.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Call Mrs. (^Wingfield^) ; [$ (who appeared.) $]
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What is your Christian Name?
   [$Mrs. (^Wingfield.^) $] (^Mary.^) 
   [$ (^L. Ch. Just.^) $] What do you ask her?
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] Do you know this (^Bryan Haynes^) ,  pray?
   [$Mrs. (^Wingfield.^) $] Yes, very well.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] What do you know of him?
   [$Mrs. (^Wingfield.^) $] I know nothing of him, but he is an      #
honest Man; he married
my Daughter, and always carried himself like a Gentleman; he scorns  #
the thing
that is unhandsome, and never did any thing that is unhandsome in my #
life.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jeff.^) $] Pray, how came you by this Witness? Have #
you any more of

   [$ (^Coll.^) $] I never saw her before, but I believe she hath    #
said something else in
another place. Did you ever say the contrary, pray?
   [$Mrs. (^Wingfield.^) $] No body can say so; and I had done the   #
Gentleman a great
deal of wrong if I had.

[^MR. MOWBRAY HAS GIVEN HIS EVIDENCE AND IS NOW CROSS-EXAMINED BY 
JEFFREYS.^]
   [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] Pray Sir, let me ask you one Question, When #
came you from (^York^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] We set forward the (^3d^) day of (^August^)     #
from (^Wentbridge^) .
   [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] Pray who came with you in the Company?      #
[$Mr. (^M.^) $] Mr. (^Bolron^) .
   [$Mr. (^Ser. Jeff.^) $] That was a Sunday, as I take it?          #
[$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] Then pray how long did you continue before  #
you came to (^Lond.^)
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] I think we came in on the Thursday after.
   [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] When was the first time Mr. (^Smith^) came  #
into your company?
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] Upon the Road on Sunday. [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $]  #
Was that the first time?
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] Yes. He had been at (^York^) , and went         #
further, and afterwards
came to us. [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] When did you come from (^York^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] About the Thursday before, if I be not mistaken.
   [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] Was it in a week before? [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $]  #
Yes, within a week it was.
   [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] And you and Mr. (^Bolron^) came together?   #
[$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Ser. Jeff.^) $] And you left (^Mr. Smith^) behind?        #
[$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Ser. Jeff.^) $] And he overtook you upon the Road.
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] Yes: He was to go further into the North as     #
soon as the Tryal of
Sir (^Miles Stapleton^) was over, and therefore he did very much     #
importune
me to stay in the Countrey till he came to go up with me.
   [$Mr. (^Ser. Jeff.^) $] What day was the Tryal of Sir (^Miles     #
Stapleton^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] On the Monday before.
   [$Mr. (^S. J.^) $] You are sure of that, & that Mr. (^Smith^)     #
went further into the North. 
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] I see him take Horse.
   [$Mr. (^Ser. Jeff.^) $] But he did not come into the Company of   #
you and Mr.
(^Bolron^) till the Sunday after that.
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] See ye, Sir, He did desire me to stay in the    #
Countrey till he
came, for he had a business of great concernment to impart to me,    #
but it
would be a week or a fortnight ere he came, but yet he came in a     #
shorter
time, for he said, he had received a Letter that brought him up.
   [$Mr. (^Serg. Jeff.^) $] You are sure of this? [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $]  #
Yes.
   [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] And you did not see him from the Monday     #
before, till
that Sunday? [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] No, no.
   [$Mr. (^S. Jeff.^) $] Now then, I ask you, where was that place   #
that he met with you?
   [$Mr. (^Mow.^) $] At (^Wentbridge^) .
   [$ (^Mr. S. J.^) $] And then you came from thence towards         #
(^London^) the next day?    [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Mr. S. Jeff.^) $] Now would I desire to know of you, for I   #
perceive he did attack you to say
<P 61>
something against Sir (^John Brooks^) , and finding that you could   #
not do it, because you had
no Acquaintance, he applied himself to (^Bolron^) . I would know,    #
was it between that place
and (^London^) ? [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] Yes, it was.
   [$ (^Mr. S. Jeff.^) $] And after the (^3d.^) of (^August^) ?      #
[$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] Yes, it was after we set out.
   [$ (^Mr. S. Jeff.^) $] I thought it had been the (^24th.^) of     #
(^July^) that you set out, and continued your
Journey the 25, 26, 27, 28, & (^29th.^) Alas, we have lost a great   #
deal of time between Mr.
(^Bolron^) and Mr. (^Mowbray^) . (^Bolron^) said, it was the         #
(^25th.^) they lay at such a place, and you are
gotten to the (^3d.^) of (^August^) ; you are mistaken certainly, as #
to point of time.
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] See, Sir, I will look in my Almanack, 'tis all #
set down there.
   [$ (^Mr. S. J.^) $] Let us see now if your (^Oxford^) Journey be  #
as well set down, as your Journey to (^Lond.^) is.
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] Here is my Almanack, Sir. [$ (^Mr. Jones.^) $] #
Here, look upon his Almanack.
   [$ (^Mr. Ser. Jeff.^) $] (^Mr. Jones^) , I don't care for his     #
Almanack, I had rather (^Mr. Mow.^) and (^Mr.
Bolron^) could bring their Almanacks together, and I would have them #
compared to see whether
the (^3d.^) of (^August^) in one be the (^25th.^) of (^July^) in the #
other. Did you Discourse with him upon
the Road the (^3d^) of (^August^) , and not before, and (^Bolron^)   #
that came up with you, Discourse with
him the (^25th.^) of (^July^) ? [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] I am mistaken, I  #
find.
   [$ (^Mr. Ser. Jeff.^) $] Ay, that you are, one of you most grosly.
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] See, Sir, here is my Almanack, whereby I find  #
that it is my mistake; but pray see,
Sir, here it is set down, the day we came out was the 24. the day we #
came to (^London^) was the 27.
   [$ (^Mr. S. Jeff.^) $] How didst thou set out the 3 of (^August^) #
from that place, and yet come to (^London^)
the (^27th.^) of (^July^) ?
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] I will refer my self to (^Mr. Smith^) , as to  #
the time we came up, & here is my Almanack.
   [$ (^Mr. S. Jeff.^) $] I will believe thy Almanack to speak       #
truth, though it have never so many
Errors about the Changes of the Weather, sooner than I will believe  #
thee.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] I perceive the man is mistaken in the moneth and  #
the time; but pray my Lord will
you please to see, for Justice sake, if the Almanack be new writ.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Look you, here is the matter,                  #
(^Mr Colledge^) , he was asked again, and again, what
day it was, and he was positive to the (^3d.^) of (^August^) .
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] He was mistaken, but his Almanack is right.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] He speaks rashly, that is the best can be said.
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] It was a mistake of mine, Sir (^George^) , but #
my Almanack is right.
   [$ (^Mr. Ser. Jeff.^) $] Nay, (^Mr. Mowbray^) , don't enter into  #
Dialogues with me, I only make a 
little Observation upon your Almanack. [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] It was     #
only my mistake.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You are a rash man to affirm so: If you had an #
Almanack, you should have
consulted it, or referred to it.
   [$ (^Mr. Ser. Jeff.^) $] Nay, we have lost a day even by your     #
Almanack; for yours says, it was
the (^27th.^) you came to Town, (^Bolron^) the (^28th.^) 
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] I refer my self to (^Mr. Smith^) , he can't    #
deny, but he came up with us at that time. 
   [$ (^Mr. S. Jeff.^) $] You were examined at Sir (^Miles           #
Stapletons^) Tryal, was you not, (^Mr. Mowbray^) ?
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] I was an Evidence there.                       #
[$ (^Mr. S. Jeff.^) $] Did the Jury believe you?
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] They did acquit Sir (^Miles Stapleton^) .
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] That is nothing to the purpose; so was            #
(^Mr. Smith^) too.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Would you ask any thing further?               #
[$ (^Coll.^) $] Call (^Mrs. Mary Bolron^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] If you have any more Witnesses, pray call them.
   [$ (^Mr. Just. Jones.^) $] (^Mr. Mowbray^) , was (^Mr. Bolron's^) #
Wife by when this Discourse was?
   [$ (^Mr. Mow.^) $] No, she was in Town, she did not go down with  #
him at all.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Are you (^Mr. Bolron's^) Wife?                 #
[$ (^Mrs. Bolron.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Well, what do you ask her? [$ (^Coll.^) $]     #
(^Mrs. Bolron^) , Pray do you know (^Mr. John Smith^) ?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bol.^) $] Yes, I do know him. [$ (^Coll.^) $] What can  #
you say of him?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bol.^) $] He sent several times for my Husband and      #
(^Mr. Mowbray^) to my House, something
he would have them be concerned in, some business he had in hand.    #
[$ (^L. C. J.^) $] When was that?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bol.^) $] Within this 3 weeks, since he came up from    #
(^York^) Assizes.
   [$ (^Coll.^) $] You may see there was an understanding between    #
them then.
   [$ (^Mr. Just. Jones.^) $] Did they go accordingly?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bol.^) $] Now and then they have gone to him, but they  #
knew his business, because they
had Discourse with him, as they said, upon the Road, and they would  #
not go.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Would you ask her any thing else? What do you  #
know more?
   [$Mrs. (^Bolron.^) $] Nothing, for I am not one that stirs much   #
abroad.

[^COLLEDGE HAS JUST DENIED THE PAPERS FOUND IN HIS HOUSE TO BE HIS.^]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How came you to have so many seized in your    #
house?
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] My Lord, here is (^Elizabeth Hunt^) , the     #
Maid by whom they were taken in,
and who can give you an account of it. I cannot deny but that they   #
were in my
house; but that I was the Author, or did take them in, is as great a #
mistake as ever
was made. Call (^Elizabeth Hunt^) . I do not know whether (^Curtis^) #
be in Town; but this
I am confident, he was Examined before the King and Council, and he  #
and his Wife
denyed it.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] He shall be called if he be here.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] I know nothing of the printing of them, nor   #
was I the Author of them.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] They were dispersed by you up and down.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] That they were in my house, I believe, my     #
Lord; and this woman will tell
you how, my Lord. Pray tell the Court how these Papers that are      #
called the
(^Raree-shew^) came to be in my house.
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] A Porter brought three bundles to our house,  #
and asked whether my Master
was not within. I told him, no, he was not. Said he, These Papers    #
are to be left here;
said I, Who do they come from? said he, 'tis all one for that, you   #
must pay me, and I must
leave them here; so I gave him six pence, and he left the Papers,    #
but I never saw the
<P 75>
man since nor before. And, my Lord, I never read them what they      #
were, but I saw
they were such sort of prints as those.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How long was it before they were seized?
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] A matter of seven or eight weeks.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] My Lord, it seems they were put in a Box, and #
left in my Counting house:
I never touched them, but there they staid, for ought I know, till   #
they were taken.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You were (^Colledges^) Servant, were you not?
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] My Lord, I neither knew the Printer nor the   #
Author; but I heard a man
was in trouble about them, upon a By-Law in the (^Stationers^)       #
Company.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] How came you by that Original?
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] Have you it there? I know of none was         #
produced. But if I were a
person concerned, it were no Treason; and, my Lord, I hope you will  #
do me that Justice,
to let the Jury know they are not Treason, none of these Papers. And #
I do declare I
know nothing of the Original, the Printer, nor the Author.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You spend time in making Observations out of   #
order of time: when you
have given your Evidence, then make your Observations.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] I confess I may erre as to matter of Order,   #
for I was never in this
capacity before. But pray do you tell the Court how the Papers came  #
there, and all the
transactions. For I was a Prisoner when they came and searched.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] No, it was eight weeks before you were taken   #
they were left there.
   [$ (^Mr. Serj. Jefferies.^) $] Did you tell your Master soon      #
after they were left there?
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Mr. Serj. Jefferies.^) $] Within what time did you tell him?
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] I believe it was a week or a fortnight.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Where was your Master all that time?
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] He was in the Countrey.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] My Lord, I did see them there, I must         #
confess, I do not deny but I saw them
there, but I knew not whence they came, nor whose they were. Nor did #
I ever intend
to meddle with them, nor concern my self about them. What have you   #
to say more?
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] Concerning Mr. (^Dugdale^)                    #
[^SOURCE TEXT: (^Dugdgale^) ^] , if I may speak.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Ay, go on.
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] I went to receive the Money of (^Mr.          #
Dugdale^) that he owed my Master, and
asking him for it, he said, he would pay me such a time to morrow    #
morning if I would
come for it; but when I came, he had not the Money ready for me.     #
Sir, said I, I think 'tis
very hard that you should keep my Masters Money from him, and yet    #
you go and Swear
against his Life too: what do you think we shall do at home in the   #
Family, if you keep
my Masters Money and he be in Prison? Said he, There is a great deal #
of do about my
Swearing against your Master, more than needs; but as I hope for     #
Salvation, I do not
believe (^Mr. Colledge^) had any more hand in any Conspiracy against #
His Majesty, than the
Child unborn. Here is (^Dugdale^) , let him deny it if he can.
   [$ (^Mr. Dugdale.^) $] As I hope for Salvation I did not say so.
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] Upon my Salvation 'tis true what I say.
   [$ (^Stephens.^) $] This was the Maid that hid her Masters papers #
when they were searched
for.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Jefferies.^) $] Be quiet; art thou got into         #
Dialogues with the Maid now?
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] (^Mr. Stevens^) , 'tis well known what a man  #
you are to propagate Witnesses.
My Lord, she gave me an account of this in the (^Tower^) , before I  #
came away, that
(^Dugdale^) desired to speak with Mr. (^Smith^) , and told her, that #
nothing that he had to say would
touch my Life.
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] As I am alive 'tis true.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr. (^Dugdale^) denies it now.
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] He is not a right man if he denies it, for he #
told it me twice.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] I told Mr. (^Smith^) of it, when he had leave #
to come to me: I told him what
the Maid said he had said to her, and this was three weeks ago; said #
he, I will speak
with him with all my heart, if he has a mind to speak with me; for   #
he hath said
that he hath nothing against her Master that can touch an hair of    #
his head, nor nothing
that can touch his Life, that he knew nothing of a Plot or           #
contrivance against the King;
and if I could help it, I had as lieve have given a hundred pound I  #
had never spoken
what I have. This he said to her.
<P 76>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You tell her what to say.
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] Sir, he does not tell me, for Mr. (^Dugdale^) #
said those very things to me.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] This is an account I had when I was a         #
Prisoner, I could not direct her.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do you deny what they say to be true, Mr.      #
(^Dugdale^) ?
   [$ (^Mr. Dugdale.^) $] My Lord, she came to me for money; I told  #
her I had it not ready, but
would pay her: And in the shop, before the Apprentice-boy, she       #
desired of me that I
would write two or three words what I had to say against her Master, #
and I told Mr.
(^Graham^) of it. So, said I, I cannot tell, I have not the Papers,  #
nor what Informations
I have given against him. So she came again the next morning, and    #
she was at me to
write down what I said. I wonder, said I, your Master will send you! #
had not he as
good send Mr. (^Smith^) , who is his Counsel? And this was all the   #
words we had.
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] My Lord, I do solemnly assure you, he said he #
would write down what he
had said against my Master, and would fain speak with Mr.            #
(^Smith^) , for there was more
ado made about it than needs.
   [$ (^Mr. Dugdale.^) $] Mr. (^Graham^) can tell what it was; for I #
came and told him
immediately.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you tell her you had nothing to say        #
against her Master that would touch
his life?
   [$ (^Mr. Dugdale.^) $] I could not say that I had said nothing    #
against her Master, for she
asked me that I would write down what I had said; but I told her I   #
knew not what
was Treason, that must be referred to the Court.
   [$ (^Mr. Just. Jones.^) $] Did he speak it openly or privately to #
you?
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] He did not speak it aloud; no body heard him  #
but my self.
   [$ (^Mr. Dugdale.^) $] It was in the shop, and the Apprentice-boy #
was by.
   [$ (^Mr. Just. Levins.^) $] Was this after he had been at the     #
(^Old-bayly^) , or before?
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] Yes, it was after he had been at the          #
(^Old-bayly^) , and after he had been at
(^Oxon^) too.
   [$ (^Mr. Just. Levins.^) $] Then it was before the Court what     #
could be made of it.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] She hath gone forty times for the money I     #
lent him out of my pocket; and
I lent him that, when I had little more my self.
   [$ (^El. Hunt.^) $] I did tell him, Mr. (^Dugdale^) , if you      # 
can't let me have my Masters money, if
you please to tell me what you have made Oath against my Master.     #
Said he, I can't
let thee have it now; but thou shalt have what I have to say against #
him: I will draw
it up in Writing, and thou shalt have it to morrow-morning. The next #
morning I
came to him again, and said I, I am come again, what must I do? Said #
he, I have no
money, such an one hath not hoped me to it. Sir, then, said I, I     #
hope you will be as
good as your word, to let me know what you have made Oath against my #
Master.
Said he, I was about it yesterday, but could not do it: But,         #
Sweetheart, said he, (and
took me by the hand) I will give you a Copy of it to day at ten of   #
the clock; and if I
do not, I will tell it thee by word of mouth. So I came to the house #
at ten, and staid
till eleven, but did not see him.
   [$ (^Mr. Just. Jones.^) $] You had a great mind to be tampering.
   [$ (^El. Jones.^) $] The first time, he asked me who was his      #
Counsel; I told him, Mr. (^Smith^) ;
then said he, I have a great desire to speak with him: So I told my  #
Master of it.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] My Lord, you see it is but black and white,   #
all this whole contrivance upon
me. She hath proved I knew nothing of these Papers, and indeed I did #
not.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do you call any more Witnesses?
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] There is my Brother-in-law that received      #
those Papers. Call (^George Spur^)
and (^Sarah Godwin^) .
[$ ( (^Mrs.^) Godwin (^appeared^) .) $] [^SQUARE BRACKETS IN SOURCE 
TEXT RENDERED AS ROUND BRACKETS.^]
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] Do you know any thing of the Papers that were #
carried to my Brother
(^George Spurrs^) ?
   [$ (^Mrs. Goodwin.^) $] Yes, I do. The Saturday after my Brothers #
Confinement, about
eight of the clock in the morning, I having heard of it, came into   #
the House, and in a
quarter of an hours time, in comes a Waterman and desires an handful #
or two of shavings.
I knowing not who he was, nor what he desired them for, told him, he #
should have them;
so he went up to the working shop to gather them, for he pretended   #
that to be his 
business.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Whose Waterman was it?
   [$ (^Mrs. Goodwin.^) $] A Waterman I suppose that belonged to His #
Majesty, for he had a Coat
marked with (^R. C.^)
<P 77>
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] This is after I was in Custody.
   [$ (^Mrs. Goodwin.^) $] Yes, it was the Saturday after. So no     #
sooner had he the shavings,
but he goes out of the Shop, and comes in again with Three of His    #
Majesties 
Messengers, and they made enquiry after papers, and I being innocent #
of concealing any
papers, or any thing said I knew of none, so they came to one box    #
that had the Tooles
for the men to work with, and they demanded the keys. I told him, I  #
knew not where
the keys were. So they went to the next and found it open, but       #
nothing did they find
there, there was a Bed wherein formerly my Brothers Servants did     #
lye. Said one to the
other, Look well whether there be not something hid in that bed,     #
said I, I suppose there
is no such thing as you inquire for: if you please, you may take off #
the Cloths, and
gave them free toleration to look, but for the Chest, I would not    #
deliver the keys,
because the man was not there that owned it. In their searching,     # 
they flung down the
Wainscote, and did a great deal of damage to his Goods. Gentlemen,   #
said I, I
suppose you have Order to search, but none to spoil a mans Goods.    #
When they were
gone, having found none, they threatned God dam them they would have #
them, for
there they were. But I being ignorant of the concealment of the      #
papers, I requested
the Maid and my Brothers Son, whether they knew of any papers, and   #
they satisfied me
they knew of some prints that were brought by a Porter, to be left   #
at my Brothers,
but they knew not whence they came, nor what they were: and the same #
answer gave
my Brothers Son, that he did not know whose the papers were. But     #
since his Fathers
Confinement, they were laid up sure and safe, for they knew not what #
they concerned.
Upon this, my Lord, my Brother-in-law (^George Spur^) , he comes     #
into the house, and if it
please your Honour, I requested him to carry them into the Countrey  #
to his house, to
secure them till we knew what they did concern, and who they did     #
belong to.
Whereupon he replyed, my Lord, That he was fearful to carry any      #
thing out of the house;
said I, If you will please to take them of me, I will carry them out #
of the house for your
security, because his Wife looked every hour (being with Child) when #
she should be
delivered, and he was fearful of troubling her. So I carried them    #
out of the house,
and delivered them to him. [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] To whom?
   [$ (^Mrs. Goodwin.^) $] To my Brother-in-law (^Mr. George         #
Spur^) . So at my going out, after I
had delivered them to him, in my way back again, I found a small     #
paper-Book, and a
small parcel of Writings, who dropped them, or who laid them there,  #
I cannot tell. But
taking them up unadvisedly, I put them among the prints, which I     #
carried out; I
delivered them to my Brother-in-law. This is all I have to say as to #
the papers.
   [$ (^Stevens.^) $] Three parts of what she hath said is false.
   [$ (^Mr. Serj. Jefferies.^) $] Well, hold you your tongue.
   [$ (^Stevens.^) $] (^Mr. Atterbury^) is here, my Lord, that       #
searched the house.
   [$ (^Atterbury.^) $] Be pleased to give me my Oath, I will tell   #
you what passed.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] We don't think it material, but you were  #
Sworn before, stand up.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Tell the manner of finding the papers. This    #
woman gives us an account of
a Waterman that came in, pretending to fetch shavings.
   [$ (^Atterbury.^) $] Upon my Oath it was not so. The Waterman was #
a Waterman that
brought me and two more of my Fellows, and the Waterman followed us  #
into the
yard but came after us: and being ordered to look for papers, I did  #
search the House;
for I had Intelligence that there were papers there, but I did not   #
find them there. But
upon finding the first papers, I made the more diligent search, but  #
could not find the rest
I most chiefly sought after.
   [$ (^Mr. Serj. Jefferies.^) $] Did the Kings Waterman take any    #
shavings by himself?
   [$ (^Atterbury.^) $] We were all together, we did not move out of #
any one Room, but
together, this Gentlewoman was in the house when I came, and there   #
was a little Child,
a Girl, and this Maid was there.
   [$ (^Mr. Serj. Jefferies.^) $] Did you come for shavings there,   #
pray (^Mr. Atterbury^) ? 
   [$ (^Atterbury.^) $] No, I did not. [$ (^Mrs. Goodwin.^) $] The   #
Waterman did though first.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] Call (^George Spur^) . [$ (But he did not     #
appear.) $] But (^Mr. Atterbury^) , before you go
down, pray tell the Court, did you take any of these papers at my    #
house, or at my
Brother-in-law (^Spurs^) house?
   [$ (^Sewel.^) $] My Lord, I took the papers, and I took them at   #
(^Bushy^) at (^Spur's^) house. And
this woman carried out one half to (^Spur^) , and the Maid carried   #
out the other.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] When did he carry them?
   [$ (^Mrs. Goodwin.^) $] The same day they searched for them, for  #
my Brother came in at the
same time. [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] How do you know (^Spur^) carried any   #
away?
<P 78>
   [$ (^Mrs. Goodwin.^) $] He carried none out of the house, I       #
carried them out of the house and
delivered them to him.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Then they were in your house?
   [$ (^Mrs. Goodwin.^) $] They were in the Counting-house.
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] My Lord, If they were in any other place, I   #
know not how they came there,
for this was all done after I was a Prisoner, and (^Sewel^) says     #
they were removed when I
was a Prisoner. Where is (^George Spur^) ?
   [$ (^Mr. Serj. Jefferies.^) $] It is admitted they were at your   #
house, and taken thence, and
afterwards carried to (^Spurs^) .
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] They carried them abroad and handed them from #
one to another, and took
them into the Countrey, I know not what they did with them, but, my  #
Lord, I
neither know the Printer nor the Author, I declare it upon my life.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Have you any more Witnesses?
   [$ (^Colledge.^) $] No, my Lord, I have not.
