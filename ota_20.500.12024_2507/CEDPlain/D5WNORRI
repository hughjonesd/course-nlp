[} (^COPY OF THE DEPOSITION OF LIEUTENANT HUGH
PALLISSER, FIRST LIEUTENANT OF THE ESSEX.^) }]
   [$Hugh Pallisser, first lieutenant of his 
Majesty's ship the Essex, deposeth, That on
Saturday the 11th of (^February^) last, from the time
the admiral made the signal to engage, 'till sunset,
the Essex never was within gun-shot of the
enemy; for she hauled out of the line of battle when
the Namur began the engagement, and then lay
to windward (at least gun-shot) of the line.$]
   [$The deponent further saith, That they began
to fire when the admiral did; but he judging
that they were too far off, came up on the
quarter-deck to inform the captain thereof, who would
not allow the deponent time to speak to him, but
ordered him forward; saying,$] "For God's sake,
Pallisser, go forward and help them to trim
the head-sails;" (we being then luffing, and
the foretop-sails in the wind.) [$When the deponent
returned again on the quarter-deck, he was
ordered down by the captain, who said to him, as
he was offering to speak,$] "Go down to your
quarters, Sir," [$which the deponent
accordingly did, and found that by their having luffed so
much, none of the starboard guns could be brought
to bear on the enemy, upon which a mate came
<P 21>
down with orders to cease firing; and to point
the metal aft. The deponent says, that also by
the luffing they brought the Dorsetshire to bear
in the same manner as the enemy's ship did, and
that some of the men mistook her for an enemy,
and fired at her, which the deponent observing,
stopped them 'till the smoak cleared away, and
then discovered her blue ensign. In a short time
after this, the deponent was sent for by the
captain, to ask his advice, whether it was not better
to stay where they were, than to bear down where
there were five fresh ships of the enemy coming
up? The deponent, after desiring a little time to
look round him, answered, that if they did not
go down to the assistance of the Marlborough,
which then had lost her masts, she would
certainly be destroy'd, or taken by them five ships.
The deponent then looking about him, saw the
Anne Gally fire-ship going down towards the
Real, and then represented to the captain, the
improbability of her ever doing any execution, if
some ships did not go down to cover her from
the aforesaid fireships, particularly the headmost,
whose shot at that time flew very thick about
her. This the deponent often repeated, to which
the captain as often replied,$] "We must not go
down, if we do, we shall be sunk and tore to
pieces." [$The deponent represented to captain
Norris, that if they would only bear down on the
Real as the Dorsetshire, they should do execution
upon her, as she was then going off in a disabled
condition; but to this the captain made no
answer, but seemed displeased with it.
   Some time after, Mr. Bentley, one of the
admiral's lieutenants, came under the stern, and
<P 22>
told captain Norris, that if he did not bear down
to the assistance of the Marlborough, she would
be lost; to which he made no direct answer, but
said, he should be tore to pieces. And the
deponent then said to mr. Bentley, that captain
Norris seemed$] to be afraid them five ships would be
too many for us; [$to which mr. Bentley
answered, that he had been on board the Dorsetshire,
which was filling powder, and going down, and
then went away; but the captain then whispered
the deponent, That mr. Bentley did not say, it
was the admiral's orders; to which the deponent
answered,$] I hope the admiral is not kill'd.
   [$The deponent further saith, that after sinking
the fire-ship they bore away a little, and that then
he went to the captain to ask him, whether he
should go down and try a single shot? to which
the captain answered,$] do Pallisser. [$Upon the
deponent's firing one gun, the people were so eager
that they fired several; upon which he received
a message from the captain, at his peril to fire no
more, for the shot fell short. After this some
time, the deponent with the captain's leave try'd
two several shot, both which he himself saw
fall short.$]
   [$At this distance the deponent saith, they kept
from the enemy 'till sun-set, when the admiral
wore, and they followed him and fired upon the
enemy as they passed by them; which was the
only time they were near enough to do
execution.$]
   [$The deponent further saith, that for the whole
day, the captain never endeavoured to chear or
encourage the petty-officers and seamen to
do their duty; but on the contrary appeared
with a down-cast-dejected countenance, often
<P 23>
crying with a sigh,$] I wish it was over. [$And
further this deponent saith not.$]

THIRD LIEUTENANT OF THE ESSEX.^) }]
   [$Hamilton Gore, third lieutenant of his
majesty's ship the Essex, deposeth, That
on Saturday the 11th of February last, the said
ship under the command of captain Norris, never
was within gun-shot of the enemy 'till the
evening; for the deponent often tried (as did several
of the ship's company) and found the shot always
fall short. He also addeth, that there was a
general murmur among the men, because they
did not go down to the assistance of the
Marlborough; and moreover saith, that they were to
windward much, of all the ships in the admiral's
division. And further this deponent saith not.$]

[} (^COPY OF THE DEPOSITION OF LIEUTENANT JOSEPH PEYTON,
FOURTH LIEUTENANT OF THE ESSEX.^) }]
   [$Joseph Peyton, fourth lieutenant of his
majesty's ship the Essex, deposeth, That in the
preparations for the engagement which happen'd
<P 24>
the 11th of February last, captain Norris made
all the dispositions, and took all the precautions
that became a good officer; but when the fleets
were closing for action he was quite dispirited,
never speaking but with a melancholy and
dejected tone, and shewing in all his actions the
greatest signs of fear; of which the deponent is
the more convinced, as he kept so far to
windward of his station in the line of battle, not
being for the whole day within gun-shot of the
enemy.$]
   [$The deponent also saith, that when the
Namur and Marlborough bore down upon the Real,
they in the Essex edged down a little, 'till they
came about the distance of a random shot from
the ship a-stern of the Spanish admiral, and then
began to fire. After they had fired for some
time, the deponent saw the Marlborough's masts
go away, upon which he went on the
quarter-deck to desire captain Norris to bear down to
her assistance; to which the he answered,$] If I go
down, these five sail will tear me to pieces
[$ (meaning the five sail in the rear of the Spanish
squadron) $] and we had better stay for the ships
coming up a-stern. [$The deponent then said, The
Marlborough was in the greatest danger of those
five sail; and that if the Essex bore down to her
she could be of great service to her. The
captain then sent for mr. Pallisser to ask his advice;
but while he was looking about to see the
disposition of the enemy, mr. Bentley, one of the
admiral's lieutenants came under the stern, and
desired captain Norris to bear down to the assistance
of the Marlborough; to which he answer'd,$] if
it is the admiral's orders I will bear down among
<P 25>
the middle of them, tho' they will tear me
to pieces, and therefore I think it will be better
to stay for the ships coming up a-stern, and then
to go down together. [$The deponent does not
remember what mr. Bentley said to this, only
that he shrugg'd his shoulders and went away.$]
   [$The deponent saith, that he has but a
confused idea of what happened till they wore after
the admiral, and as they haul'd the wind on the
starboard-tack, captain Norris came into the
weater-gangway, and stooping under the shelter of
the hammocks, called out to the deponent, for
God's sake to mind sails, expressing in all his
behaviour the utmost terror; but this being the
first time the men were within point blank of the
enemy, their order was such, the deponent could
not get them from the guns, but was oblig'd to
take the marines from off the forcastle, to haul
the fore-bow-line, because the captain was most
uneasy about the fore-sail, as it shook in the
wind. The deponent further saith, that he often
cast his eyes upon the captain, and to the best
of his remembrance, he never stood erect, or
left the place where he was 'till the firing ceased,
nor ever encouraged the people, or shewed any
marks of the commander; but on the contrary,
put on a short shooting-jacket, and one of the
purser's leather caps. And further this deponent
saith not.$]

[} (^MR. MYRE'S (MASTER OF THE ESSEX) DEPOSITION.^) }]

   [$Joseph Myers, master of his majesty's ship
Essex, deposeth, That on the morning of the
11th of February last, after the admiral had
made the signal to engage, captain Norris shew'd
all the signs of the utmost fear and dejection; and
upon the deponent singing the famous
Ninety-two, the captain said,$] it will be all over with us
presently, we shall have no reason to sing; [$and
then walked about sighing, and shewing in his
face the greatest confusion; and
notwithstanding an officer came from the admiral between
eight and nine o'clock in the morning, with
directions to him to keep the line as close as
possible, yet after the action began, till sun-set, he
never was in the line.$]
   [$The deponent sayeth, that after the admiral
began the engagement, captain Norris said to
him,$] 'There will be the Dorsetshire and us
for that ship a-stern of the Real;' [$to which the
deponent said,$] the devil's in it if we be not
enough for her ourselves. [$Then the captain
edged down a little and began to fire, but
presently after sprung his luff, which the deponent
seeing, and that the shot fell short, told the
captain that it was heaving powder and shot over
board to fire any longer, and could answer no
purpose; and upon his telling him so a second
time he ordered all firing to cease, and then lay
a considerable distance to windward of his station;
the Dorsetshire and Rupert, the ships a-head
and a-stern, being a great way to leeward of
<P 27>
[^AN ERRONEOUS PAGE NUMBER IN SOURCE TEXT: 37^]
them. When they had laid thus some time, the
captain ordered a gun to be laid down, to see
whether it could reach the enemy, and seeing it
did not, try'd a second, but to no purpose, they
both falling short. Then seeing the Ann galley
fire-ship bearing down upon the Real, the
captain sent for Mr. Pallisser to advise with him,
what was best to be done; who, after he had
looked about him, answered, that if they did
not go down to cover the fire-ship, she must be
sunk by the headmost of those fire-ships
coming up; upon which the captain turned away
from mr. Pallisser, nor does the deponent
remember that he gave him any answer.$]
   [$The deponent farther says, that in the close
of the evening when the admiral wore down
among the enemy, the captain ordered him to
tack, which the deponent, said$] 'Tack sir! the
ship will not stay, we must wear after the
admiral.' [$Then he ordered the helm a-weather;$]
I ran forward and bid them hoist the jib. [$As
soon as the ship was wore, and the yards
braced, the deponent turned himself to the
men at the guns, who continued firing, till they
passed the enemy, which when they had done,
he went a-cross to the captain in the starboard
gangway, and told him all the enemy's shot fell
a-stern of them. He then came out of the
gangway, and the deponent said to him$] 'What
would it have been if we had tacked? [$The
captain said,$] 'I am very glad now, that we
wore."
   [$The deponent further saith, that during the
time they were running past the enemy, he never
saw the captain on the quarter-deck, but
<P 28>
always in the starboard gangway couching under
the hammocks. And that further this deponent
saith not.$]

last, he observed, that all the shot which they
fired, till the time they wore after the admiral
in the evening, fell short of the enemy, the
Essex being a considerable distance to windward
of the Dorsetshire and Rupert, the ships next
a-head and a-stern of her; that when the
Marlborough lost her masts, the men on the forecastle
(where the deponent commanded) were quite
mutinous, because they could not go down to

considerable distance to windward of the

deponent down to the first lieutenant with
directions to him at his peril to leave off firing, and
not to begin again without directions from
him, but to point two or three guns at different

Essex, captain Richard Norris commander; that
<P 36>
the deponent was not off of the said ship's

Norris, and therefore as well or better to judge
of his personal conduct as any other could be;
and this deponent maketh oath, That he did not
once observe in captain Norris any signs of fear
or cowardice, but on the contrary, that he did,
to the best of this deponent's opinion, make a
just and good disposition in his ship for a
defence against the enemy: That he gave all his
orders in a distinct and punctual manner,
without confusion or sign of fear: That he (the
deponent) did not once see captain Norris bob or
shelter himself in the gang-way, which he (the
deponent) thinks is absolutely impossible for
captain Norris to have done, without his (the
deponent's) notice, but on the contrary, to the best
of his knowledge and belief, captain Norris did
not once quit the quarter-deck: That he did not
see or hear lieutenant Jekyll, or any other officer,
use any perswasion to captain Norris to bear
down, which the deponent verily believes he must
have heard, had any such been used. This
deponent further declares, that just after the
Marlborough's being disabled, lieutenant Bentley came
under the Essex stern, and proposed to captain
Norris to bear down, upon which he asked twice
over if it was the admiral's orders to bear
down? and it was both times answered no. Capt.
Norris then desired lieut. Bentley to let a signal
be made on board the Namur as soon as he got
on board her, if it should be the admiral's
pleasure for the Essex to bear down, (or words to
<P 37>
that purpose;) that then capt. Norris sent for his
lieutenants upon the quarter-deck, and asked
their opinions concerning bearing down, and
that the said lieutenants were of opinion that capt.
Norris could not break the line, unless the signal
was made from the admiral for him so to do.$]
   [$This deponent further saith, that he has read
a copy of a letter said to be sent to admiral
Matthews from lieut. Jekyll, and that the aspersions
thrown on capt. Norris in the said letter, are, in
this deponent's judgment, scandalous, false,
groundless, and malicious. And this deponent
further saith, that he did not see or hear of any
murmuring, or discontent, either among the
officers or company of the said ship, upon any
account; but on the contrary all the lieutenants
were in a good harmony with capt. Norris, as
well the day before as after the engagement, and
as long as he, this deponent, continued on
board: And this deponent further adds, that a
day after the engagement lieut. Pallisser went on
board the admiral's ship, and on his return was
asked by the deponent how the admiral did, as

   [$John Brown, a first lieutenant of the
honourable colonel Powlett's regiment of marines,
maketh oath, That he commanded a
detachment of the said marines, on board his
majesty's ship the Essex, on the 11th of February
last, the day of engagement off of Toulon; and
that capt. Richard Norris, commander of the
said ship, did, to the best of this deponent's
judgment, make a good and just disposition of
his officers and men, in order for a defence
against the enemy; and did, during the whole
time of the engagement, carefully and
punctually deliver his orders to his officers; nor did
this deponent once observe the said capt.
Norris to quit the deck, or bob, or shew any signs
of fear or cowardice, but on the contrary, he
behaved, to the best of this deponent's judgment,
like a soldier and a man of honour. And this
deponent further saith, that altho' captain Norris
and himself were not upon the footing he, the
deponent, could have wished, yet he thinks himself
obliged to declare that the aspersions thrown on
capt. Norris, in a letter said to be sent by lieut.
Jekyll to admiral Mathews, are, in his opinion,
unjust, cruel, and malicious.$]

   [$Moses Ferrin. boatswain's mate of his
majesty's ship Essex, maketh oath, That on the
11th day of February last, the day of the
engagement off cape Seicie, being quarter'd
captain of the first gun, and its opposite on the
quarter-deck; that captain Norris, in the
beginning of the action, encourag'd the whole ship's
company to behave like Englishmen; and gave
the first lieutenant orders to keep the people to
their quarters, and if any deserted them, to cut
them down: that the said captain behaved the
whole time of the engagement with great
courage and conduct, and without the least shew
of fear or cowardice, nor was the least confus'd;
but issued his orders in a brave, undaunted 
manner, and frequently spoke to us at our quarters
to this intent;$] Mind, my good boys, and take
good aim, and don't fire your shot in waste:
[$that he heard captain Norris speak to the
master, to the intent to bear down and engage the
Spanish ship under the Real's lee-quarter; but the
master (who was then standing on the heel of
the top-mast in the booms, and looking at our
fleet a-stern) objected to it, saying, it was better to
stay till mr. Lestock was come up;$] for in
bearing down now, [$he said,$] we shall have the five
sail all upon us.
   [$He further declares, That when admiral
Mathews bore down in the evening he heard
captain Norris order the helm a-weather, to
hoist the jib, and ware-ship; and says, he never
<P 40>
heard any orders given by the captain during
the whole action, to tack ship, nor did perceive
the least motion made for that purpose: that
when admiral Mathews bore down, we did the
same after him, and kept a continual fire at the
enemy till dark, being then about musquet-shot
from the enemy; that at the same the master
call'd him away from his quarters, telling him,
that he must fire no more, for he could not hit
the enemy: the captain then said,$] My lads, if
you can hit them, do. [$This deponent further
says, that he did not see lieutenant Jekyll upon
the quarter-deck the whole time of the action;
but that he observ'd him to say to the people
that were quarter'd to the guns on the upper
deck about him, to the best of my remembrance,
that he was 32 years old, but that he did not
know he should live to see the engagement out;
at the same time he said, mr. Jekyll look'd much
dejected, and stood in a fearful posture, with his
sword pointed to the deck; that the said
lieutenant Jekyll's letter to admiral Mathews against
captain Norris is entirely false and malicious,
and done only with a design of endeavour to
prejudice him. And further saith not.$]

QUARTER-MASTER.^) }]

   [$John Gillespy, quarter-master of his majesty's
ship Essex, maketh oath, That on the 11th of
Feb. last, the day of the engagement off Toulon,
he was quartered to the cunn on board the same
ship, and when the signal was made to engage,
capt. Norris, commander of the said ship,
encourag'd them all to behave as Englishmen, and the
whole time of the engagement behaved with
bravery and composure, and issued his orders in
a punctual manner without confusion, or shewing
any signs of fear or cowardice; that$] I heard [$the
said$] captain Norris propose to the master to bear
down to attack the ship a-stern of the Spanish
admiral, which the master objected to, saying,
that we should have the fire of the five Spanish
ships coming up.
   [$That when admiral Mathews bore down in
the evening,$] I heard our captain order the helm
to be put a-weather, and the jib to be hoisted,
and that we immediately wore ship; [$and that
captain Norris did not shew the least intention or
inclination to tack, which mr. Jekyll falsely
accuses him with; and that$] immediately we wore,
and kept a continual fire within about a musket
shot of the enemy a-stern of the Namur, and
to the leeward withal; [$neither did captain Norris
make any sail to get off, but continued firing till
night put an end to the engagement.$]
   [$This deponent further saith, That the said
captain Norris did not, during the engagement
<P 42>
shelter himself in the gangway, which place was
worse barricaded than any other upon deck, and
the worst place in the ship above the upper
deck that a man could fly to for shelter; that
there were but two tires of hammocks, those
very indifferently stowed, and much settled by
people's footing on them to get up the main
shrouds. That he neither saw lieutenant Jekyll
or any other person go to, or perswade captain
Norris to bear down, nor did he observe any
murmuring or discontent among the people.$]
   [$And it is the opinion of the said deponent,
that$] if lieutenant Jekyll had acted like an officer,
we might have gotten the vessels out which were
burnt at Casse; [$and that when lieutenant Jekyll
was sent to set fire to the said vessels,$] he sent me
[$the said deponent,$] to set them on fire; for he
never offered to go on board the vessels to see
them set on fire, but kept in the boat under the
quarter of the said vessel, calling us to make
haste to come away.
   [$And this deponent further saith, that the
aspersions thrown on captain Norris, by a letter
said to be sent by lieutenant Jekyll to admiral
Mathews, are very unjust, false, and malicious.
