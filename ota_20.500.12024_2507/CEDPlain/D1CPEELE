[$ (^Enter Anticke, Frolicke and Fantasticke.^) $]
[$ (^Anticke.^) $]
How nowe fellowe (^Franticke^) ,
what all amort [^SOURCE TEXT: a mort^] ? Doth this
sadnes become thy madnes? What
though wee haue lost our way
in the woodes, yet neuer hang
the head, as though thou hadst
no hope to liue till to morrow: for (^Fantasticke^)
and I will warrant thy life to night for twenty in
the hundred.
   [$ (^Frolicke.^) $] (^Anticke^) and (^Fantasticke^) , as I am
frollicke franion, neuer in all my life was I so
dead slaine. What? to loose our way in the
woode, without either fire or candle so
vncomfortable? (\O ca luna! O terra! O maria! O Neptune!\)
<P A3V>
[$ (^Fantas.^) $] Why makes thou it so strange, seeing
Cupid hath led our yong master to the faire
Lady and she is the only Saint that he hath sworne
to serue.
   [$ (^Frollicke.^) $] What resteth then but wee
commit him to his wench, and each of vs take his
stand vp in a Tree, and sing out our ill fortune
to the tune of O man in desperation.
   [$ (^Ant.^) $] Desperately spoken fellow Frollicke in
the darke: but seeing it falles out thus, let vs
rehearse the old prouerb.
[^VERSE OMITTED.^]
   [$ (^Fan.^) $] Hush a dogge in the wood, or a wooden
dogge, O comfortable hearing! I had euen as
liue the Chamberlaine of the white Horse had
called me vp to bed.
   [$ (^Frol.^) $] Eyther hath his trotting Cur gone out
of his cyrcuit, or els are we nere some village,
[$ (^Enter a Smith with a Lanthorne & Candle.^) $]
which should not be farre off, for I perceiue the
glymring of a Gloworme, a Candle, or a Cats
eye, my life for a halfe pennie. In the name of
my own father, be thou Oxe or Alfe that
appearest, tell vs what thou art.
   [$ (^Smith.^) $] What am I? Why I am Clunch the
Smith, what are you, what make you in my
<P A4R>
territories at this time of the night?
   [$ (^Ant.^) $] What doe we make dost thou aske? why
we make faces for feare: such as if thy mortall
eyes could behold, would make thee water the
long seames of thy side slops, Smith.
   [$ (^Frol.^) $] And in faith Sir vnlesse your hospitalitie
doe releeue vs, wee are like to wander with a
sorrowfull hey ho, among the owlets, &
Hobgoblins of the Forrest: good (^Vulcan^) , for Cupids
sake that hath cousned vs all: befriend vs as
thou maiest, and commaund vs howsoeuer,
wheresoeuer, whensoeuer, in whatsoeuer, for
euer and euer.
   [$ (^Smith.^) $] Well Masters it seemes to mee you
haue lost your waie in the wood: in
consideration whereof, if you will goe with Clunch to
his Cottage, you shall haue house roome, and a
good fire to sit by, althogh we haue no bedding
to put you in.
   [$ (^All.^) $] O blessed Smith, O bountifull Clunch.
   [$ (^Smith.^) $] For your further intertainment, it
shall be as it may be, so and so,
[$ (^Heare a Dogge barke.^) $]
Hearke this is Ball my Dogge that bids you all
welcome in his own language, come take heed
for stumbling on the threshold, open dore
Madge take in guests. [$ (^Enter old woman.^) $]
   [$ (^Ol.^) $] Welcome Clunch & good fellowes al that
come with my good ma~ for my good mans sake
<P A4V>
come on sit downe here is a peece of cheese &
a pudding of my owne making.
   [$ (^Anticke:^) $] Thanks Gammer a good example
for the wiues of our towne.
   [$ (^Frolicke:^) $] Gammer thou and thy good man
sit louingly together, we come to chat and not
to eate.
   [$ (^Smith:^) $] Well Masters if you will eate
nothing take away: Come, what doo we to passe
away the time? Lay a crab in the fire to rost for
Lambes-wooll; what shall wee haue a game at
Trumpe or Ruffe to driue away the time, how
say you?
   [$ (^Fantasticke:^) $] This Smith leades a life as
merrie as a King with (^Madge^) his wife; Syrrha
(^Frolicke^) , I am sure thou art not without some
round or other, no doubt but Clunch can beare
his part.
   [$ (^Frolicke:^) $] Els thinke you mee ill brought vp,
so set to it when you will. [$ (^they sing.^) $]
[^SONG OMITTED.^]
<P B1R>
   [$ (^Ant:^) $] This sport dooes well: but me thinkes
Gammer, a merry winters tale would driue
away the time trimly, come I am sure you are not
without a score.
   [$ (^Fantast:^) $] I saith Gammer a tale of an howre
long were as good as an howres sleepe.
   [$ (^Frol:^) $] Looke you Gammer, of the Gyant
and the Kings Daughter, and I know not what,
I haue seene the day when I was a litle one, you
might haue drawne mee a mile after you with
such a discourse.
   [$ (^Old woman:^) $] Well, since you be so
importunate, my good man shall fill the pot and get him
to bed, they that ply their worke must keepe
good howres, one of you goe lye with him, he
is a cleane skind man I tell you, without either
spauin or windgall, so I am content to driue 
away the time with an old wiues winters tale.
   [$ (^Fantast:^) $] No better hay in Deuonshire, a my
word Gammer, Ile be one of your audience.
   [$ (^Frolicke:^) $] And I another thats flat.
   [$ (^Anticke:^) $] Then must I to bed with the good
man, (^ (\Bona nox\) ^) Gammer, God night (^Frolicke^) .
   [$ (^Smith:^) $] Come on my Lad, thou shalt take
thy vnnaturall rest with me.
[$ (^Exeunt^) Anticke (^and the^) Smith.$]
   [$ (^Frollicke:^) $] Yet this vantage shall we haue of
them in the morning, to bee ready at the sight
thereof extempore.
<P B1V>
   [$ (^Old wom:^) $] Nowe this bargaine my Masters
must I make with you, that you will say hum &
ha to my tale, so shall I know you are awake.
   [$ (^Both:^) $] Content Gammer that will we doo.
   [$ (^Old wom:^) $] Once vppon a time there was a
King or a Lord, or a Duke that had a faire
daughter, the fairest that euer was; as white as snowe,
and as redd as bloud: and once vppon a time his
daughter was stollen away, and hee sent all his
men to seeke out his daughter, and hee sent so
long, that he sent all his men out of his Land.
   [$ (^Frol:^) $] Who drest his dinner then?
   [$ (^Old woman:^) $] Nay either heare my tale, or
kisse my taile.
   [$ (^Fan:^) $] Well sed, on with your tale Gammer.
   [$ (^Old woman:^) $] O Lord I quite forgot, there
was a Coniurer, and this Coniurer could doo
any thing, and hee turned himselfe into a great
Dragon, and carried the Kinges Daughter away
in his mouth to a Castle that hee made of stone,
and there he kept hir I know not how long, till
at last all the Kinges men went out so long, that
hir two Brothers went to seeke hir. O I forget:
she (he I would say) turned a proper yong man
to a Beare in the night, and a man in the day, and
keeps by a crosse that parts three seuerall waies,
& he made this Lady run mad: gods me bones
who comes here? [$ (^Enter the two Brothers.^) $]
   [$ (^Frol:^) $] Soft Gammer, here some come to tell
<P B2R>
your tale for you.
   [$ (^Fant:^) $] Let them alone, let vs heare what they
will say.
   [$ (^1. Brother:^) $] Vpon these chalkie Cliffs of (^Albion^)
We are ariued now with tedious toile,
And compassing the wide world round about
To seeke our sister, to seeke faire (^Delya^) forth,
Yet cannot we so much as heare of hir.
   [$ (^2. Brother:^) $] O fortune cruell, cruell & vnkind,
Vnkind in that we cannot find our sister;
Our sister haples in hir cruell chance:
Soft who haue we here.
[$ (^Enter Senex at the Crosse stooping to gather.^) $]
   [$ (^1. Brother:^) $] Now father God be your speed,
What doo you gather there?
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Hips and Hawes, and stickes and
strawes, and thinges that I gather on the ground
my sonne.
   [$ (^1. Brother:^) $] Hips and Hawes, and stickes and
strawes, why is that all your foode father?
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Yea sonne.
   [$ (^2. Brother:^) $] Father, here is an Almes pennie
for mee, and if I speede in that I goe for, I will
giue thee as good a Gowne of gray as euer thou
diddest weare.
   [$ (^1. Brother:^) $] And Father here is another almes
pennie for me, and if I speede in my iourney, I
will giue thee a Palmers staffe of yuorie, and a
scallop shell of beaten gold.
<P B2V>
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Was shee fayre?
   [$ (^2. Brother:^) $] I the fairest for white, and the
purest for redd, as the blood of the Deare, or the
driuen snow: 
   [$ (^Old m:^) $] Then harke well and marke well, my old spell:
Be not afraid of euery stranger,
Start not aside at euery danger:
Things that seeme are not the same,
Blow a blast at euery flame:
For when one flame of fire goes out, 
Then comes your wishes well about:
If any aske who told you this good,
Say the white Beare of Englands wood.
   [$ (^1. Brother:^) $] Brother heard you not what the
old man said: [^HE REPEATS THE VERSE.^]
   [$ (^2. Brother:^) $] Well if this doo vs any good,
Wel fare the white Bear of Englands wood. [$ (^ex.^) $]
   [$ (^Old ma:^) $] Now sit thee here & tel a heauy tale.
Sad in thy moode, and sober in thy cheere,
Here sit thee now and to thy selfe relate,
The hard mishap of thy most wretched state.
In (^Thessalie^) I liu'd in sweete content,
Vntill that Fortune wrought my ouerthrow;
<P B3R>
For there I wedded was vnto a dame,
That liu'd in honor, vertue, loue, and fame:
But (^Sacrapant^) that cursed sorcerer,
Being besotted with my beauteous loue:
My deerest loue, my true betrothed wife,
Did seeke the meanes to rid me of my life,
But worse than this, he with his chanting spels,
Did turne me straight vnto an vgly Beare;
And when the sunne doth settle in the west,
Then I begin to don my vgly hide:
And all the day I sit, as now you see,
And speake in riddles all inspirde with rage,
Seeming an olde and miserable man:
And yet I am in April of my age.
[$ (^Enter^) Venelia (^his Lady mad; and goes in againe^) .$]
See where (^Venelya^) my betrothed loue,
Runs madding all inrag'd about the woods;
All by his curssed and inchanting spels.
[$ (^Enter^) Lampriscus (^with a pot of Honney^) .$]
But here comes (^Lampriscus^) my discontented
neighbour. How now neighbour, you looke
towarde the ground aswell as I, you muse on
something.
   [$ (^Lamp:^) $] Neighbour on nothing, but on the
matter I so often mooued to you: if you do any
thing for charity, helpe me; if for neighborhood
or brotherhood, helpe me: neuer was one so
combered as is poore (^Lampryscus^) : and to
begin, I pray receiue this potte of Honny to mend
<P B3V>
your fare.
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Thankes neighbor, set it downe,
Honny is alwaies welcome to the Beare.
And now neighbour let me heere the cause of
your comming.
   [$ (^Lampriscus:^) $] I am (as you knowe
neighbour) a man vnmaried, and liued so vnquietly
with my two wiues, that I keepe euery yeare
holy the day wherin I buried the~ both; the first
was on saint (^Andrewes^) day; the other on saint
(^Lukes^) .
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] And now neighbour, you of this
country say, your custome is out: but on with
your tale neighbour.
   [$ (^Lamp:^) $] By my first wife, whose tongue
wearied me aliue, and sounded in my eares like the
clapper of a great Bell, whose talke was a
continuall torment to all that dwelt by her, or liued
nigh her, you haue heard me say I had a
handsome daughter.
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] True neighbour.
   [$ (^Lampr:^) $] Shee it is that afflictes me with her
continuall clamoures, and hangs on me like a
Burre: poore shee is, and proude shee is, as
poore as a sheepe new shorne, and as proude
of her hopes, as a Peacock of her taile well
growne.
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Well said (^Lampryscus^) , you speake
it like an Englishman.
<P B4R>
   [$ (^Lampr:^) $] As curst as a waspe, and as frowarde
as a childe new taken from the mothers teate,
shee is to my age, as smoake to the eyes, or as
vinegar to the teeth.
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Holily praised neighbour, as much
for the next.
   [$ (^Lampr:^) $] By my other wife I had a daughter,
so hard fauoured, so foule and ill faced, that I
thinke a groue full of golden trees; and the
leaues of Rubies and Dyamonds, would not
bee a dowrie aunswerable to her
deformitie.
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Well neighbour, nowe you haue
spoke, heere me speake; send them to the Well
for the water of life: there shall they finde their
fortunes vnlooked for; Neighbour farewell.
[$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Lampr:^) $] Farewell and a thousand, and now
goeth poore (^Lampryscus^) to put in execution
this excellent counsell. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
   [$ (^Frol:^) $] Why this goes rounde without a
fidling stick; but doo you heare Gammer, was this
the man that was a Beare in the night, and a
man in the day?
   [$ (^Old woman:^) $] I this is hee; and this man that
came to him was a beggar, and dwelt vppon a
greene. But soft, who comes here? O these are
the haruest men; ten to one they sing a song of
mowing.
<P B4V>
[$ (^Enter the haruest men a singing, with this^)
Song double repeated.$]
[^SONG OMITTED.^]
[$ (\Exeunt.\) $]
[$ (^Enter^) Huanebango (^with his two hand sword,
and^) Booby (^the Clowne^) .$]
   [$ (^Fant:^) $] Gammer, what is he?
   [$ (^Old woman:^) $] O this is one that is going to the
coniurer, let him alone, here what he sayes.
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] Now by (^Mars^) and (^Mercury, Iupiter^)
and (^Ianus, Sol^) and (^Saturnus, Venus^) and (^Vesta,
Pallas^) and (^Proserpina^) , and by the honor of my
house (^Polimackeroeplacydus^) , it is a wonder to see
what this loue will make silly fellowes
aduenture, euen in the wane of their wits, and infansie
of their discretion. Alas my friend what fortune
calles thee foorth to seeke thy fortune among
brasen gates, inchanted towers, fire and
Brimstone, thunder and lightning. Beautie I tell thee
is peerelesse, and she precious whom thou
affectest: do off these desires good countriman,
good friend runne away from thy selfe, and so
soone as thou canst, forget her; whom none
must inherit but he that can monsters tame,
labourers atchiue, riddles absolue, loose
inchantments, murther magicke, and kill coniuring: and
that is the great and mighty (^Huanebango^) .
<P C1R>
   [$ (^Booby:^) $] Harke you sir, harke you; First know
I haue here the flurting feather, and haue giuen
the Parish the start for the long stocke: Nowe
sir if it bee no more but running through a little
lightning and thunder, and riddle me riddle me
whats this, Ile haue the wench from the
Coniurer if he were ten Coniurers.
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] I haue abandoned the Court and
honourable company, to doo my deuoyre against
this sore Sorcerer and mighty Magitian: if this
Ladie be so faire as she is said to bee, she is mine,
she is mine. (^ (\Meus, mea, meum, in contemptum
omnium Grammaticorum.\) ^)
   [$ (^Booby:^) $] (^ (\O falsum Latinum\) ^) ! the faire maide is
(^ (\minum, cum apurtinantibus gibletes\) ^) and all.
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] If shee bee mine, as I assure my selfe
the heauens will doo somewhat to reward my
worthines; shee shall bee allied to none of the
meanest gods; but bee inuested in the most
famous stocke of (^Huanebango
Polimackeroeplacidus^) , my Grandfather: my father
(^Pergopolyneo^) :
my mother, (^Dyonora de Sardynya^) : famouslie
descended.
   [$ (^Booby:^) $] Doo you heare sir; had not you a
Cosen, that was called (^Gustecerydis^) ?
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] Indeede I had a Cosen, that somtime
followed the Court infortunately, and his name
(^Bustegustecerydis^) .
   [$ (^Booby:^) $] O Lord I know him well: hee is the
<P C1V>
knight of the neates feete.
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] O he lou'd no Capon better, he hath
oftentimes deceiued his boy of his dinner, that
was his fault good (^Bustegustecerydis^) .
   [$ (^Booby:^) $] Come shall we goe along? Soft, here
is an olde man at the Crosse, let vs aske him the
way thither. Ho, you Gaffer, I pray you tell
where the wise man the Coniurer dwells?
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] Where that earthly Goddesse
keepeth hir abode; the commander of my thougts,
and faire Mistres of my heart.
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Faire inough, and farre inough
from thy fingering sonne.
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] I will followe my Fortune after mine
owne fancie, and doo according to mine owne
discretion.
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Yet giue some thing to an old man
before you goe.
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] Father mee thinkes a peece of this
Cake might serue your turne.
   [$ (^Old man:^) $] Yea sonne.
   [$ (^Huan:^) $] (^Huanebango^) [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Huanabango^) ^]   #
giueth no Cakes for
Almes, aske of them that giue giftes for poore
Beggars. Faire Lady, if thou wert once
shrined in this bosome, I would buckler thee
haratantara. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Booby:^) $] Father doo you see this man, you litle
thinke heele run a mile or two for such a Cake,
<P C2R>
or passe for a pudding, I tell you father hee has
kept such a begging of mee for a peece of this
Cake, whoo he comes vppon me with a
superfantiall substance, and the foyson of the earth,
that I know not what he meanes: If hee came
to me thus, and said, my friend (^Booby^) or so, why
I could spare him a peece with all my heart; but
when he tells me how God hath enriched mee
aboue other fellowes with a Cake: why hee
makes me blinde and deafe at once: Yet father
heere is a peece of Cake for you as harde as the
world goes.
[^OLD MAN'S PROPHECY IN VERSE OMITTED.^]

To change and alter shapes of mortall men,

And brought hir hither to reuiue the man,
That seemeth yong and pleasant to behold,
And yet is aged, crooked, weake and numbe.
Thus by inchaunting spells I doo deceiue,
Those that behold and looke vpon my face;

dinner sir.
   [$ (^Sacr:^) $] Ah (^Delya^) , fairer art thou than the
running water, yet harder farre than steele or
Adamant.

   [$ (^Sacr:^) $] I (^Delya^) , sit & aske me what thou wilt,
thou shalt haue it brought into thy lappe.

best meate from the king of (^Englands^) table, and

Start not a side for euery danger,
Be not afeard of euery stranger;

   [$ (^Iack:^) $] Ah maister, so he deceiued them that
beheld him: but hee was a miserable, old, and
crooked man; though to each mans eye he
seemed young and fresh, for maister; this Coniurer
tooke the shape of the olde man that kept the
crosse: and that olde man was in the likenesse of
the Coniurer. But nowe maister winde your
horne. [$ (^He windes his horne.^) $]

   [$ (^Eumenid:^) $] Why I hope (^Iack^) thou doost but
iest, I promist thee halfe I got, but not halfe my
Lady.
   [$ (^Iack:^) $] But what else maister, haue you not
gotten her, therefore deuide her straight, for I

my way, and so shall you haue too before you
goe, to your breakefast.
