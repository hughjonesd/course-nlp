[}THE DISCOVERY OF THE
KNIGHTS OF THE POSTE.}]

   [$As I traueiled towardes (^Plimmoth^) , this                        
last voyage, vpon my well approued
hacney, (ould Bayard of ten toes) it was my
good lucke a little on this side (^Hounslowe^) ,
(iust vpon the heath, where that villaine
was hanged in chaines, that murdered
the maiden in the wood) to ouertake a wel
trust fellow mounted vpon as proper an nagge as my own,
but not altogether so well paced: At what time I bad him
good morrow,$] good morrow [$ (quoth he:) $] God graunt it proue
so, but as I speede, so will I praise the day: why sir [$ (said I) $]
then well ouertaken, I trust my greeting deserues noe
grudge. In deede [$ (quoth he) $] well ouertaken but ill found.
[$I musing at the man what he meant by these quibs, asked
him how so?$] Because [$ (said he) $] my purse is as empty as my
belly, and yet my stomacke as good as yours. [$I tolde him
that matter would be soone amended, if he wanted pence, to
leaue a pawne for his breakfast: The man hearing me say
so: answered, my counsaile was better then my charity,$] and
yet [$ (quoth he) $] your charity may be better then my pawne:
for I assure you, I suppose you haue more to giue, then I
haue to gage: and yet yesterday, I had as much money as
would fill a quart potte, if my wisedome had beene so good to
keepe it: Certainly [$ (said I) $] he that would spend so
prodigally, and so much in one day, without any regard, in my
opinion is worthy to fast the next day without pitty: So sir,
<P A3V>
I haue your iudgement already [$ (quoth he:) $] it is pitty you
should be made a Justice of peace, that can examine a cause
no better: If you had asked me how I had spent so much
money in so short a time, and how much the sum had beene,
you had shewen some wit: but to pronounce me prodigall at
the first dash, for so trifling a cause, argues in deede a man of
small discretion. Why [$qd. he,$] is not he to be blamde, &
counted a thriftlesse waster, that spends the quantity of a quart of
money in one day: if you had gamde it away, it had beene an
other matter, because I know it a thing soone done, and you
not so much to be blamed: for that a man cannot commaund
the dice as he may his dogge, to say, sira fetch me the same
againe? Alasse [$qd. he,$] how simple of vnderstanding are you,
iust as wise as (^Winefred^) my wife, that when I wisht her to
arme her selfe against her vnquiet neighbours, presently
clapt a corslet on her backe, and so ran among them: You
come in with a quart full of money, and I toulde you of as
much money as filde a quart, which God wot was but one
penny for the which I had a quart of ale at (^Colbrooke^) .
   O was it so, I crie you mercy [$qd. I,$] and because I haue
made you this offence, I will paye for your breakefast at
(^Staines^) , which now is not farre off: and I pray you let me
request to knowe how farre you trauell this way: Mary sir
[$qd he,$] euen as farre as I would with your company, 
finding you alwaies thus [^SOURCE TEXT: thns^] kinde: but indeede my #
iourney is to
(^Plimmoth^) , if I knew how to get thither, [$with that we went
into our Inne at the signe of the Ale-stake, where I calde
in for bread and cheese, & y=e= best beere they had in the house:$]
This is well done [$ (qd. he) $] call you in for that which is good,
and I will haue a care it shall not be lost: [$and with that he
claps a penny loafe in his pocket, and anone after he thrust
another into his bosome: I demaunding why he did so: he
answered,$] because [$ (saith he) $] I would trie whether y=e= bread
at the next towne be as good as this or no: For me thinkes
it hath a very good relish, & I assure you it is good for a man
to be experienced in such thinges, [$and still he fed vpon bread
<P A4R>
and cheese as nimbly as a squerell on a nutte. I seeing him
feede so hartely, said if his legs were as good as his stomacke
he needed not to feare his Iourney to (^Plimmoth^) : so at length
being well refresht, I tould him that according to my
promise I would pay for his breakfast, but he should pay for the
two penny loaues in his pocket:$] By the masse [$ (quoth he) $] I
am perswaded your purse is better linde then mine, 
notw=t=standing if my credit be better then yours, w=t= this my 
welfaste hoastice, I am content to passe my word for it: 
otherwise you are like to pay all for me.
   [$The woman hearing him flout at her face, was straight
inflamed as if she had beene made of tuchwood, and wholy
compact of a lump of gunpowder:$] Why thou paultry knaue
[$ (qd she) $] what ailes my face? what canst y=u= say to my face? or
what doest thou see in my face? Cox soule my face, I hope
my face is a christian bodies face, thou scuruy iacke, I tell
thee I am not ashamed to shew my face. I thinke so [$ (qd he) $]
for it is of as good scarlet die, as euer I saw in my daies:
but say, will you take my word for two pence? Take thy
word? Ile see thee hangd first [$ (qd she) $] pay me my money, or
by Gods body Ile haue you set by the heeles: [$and with that
she tooke vp her distaffe and beate him out of dores: which
I seeing was glad to content her, and so we parted from y=e=
place.$] I would [$ (quoth he) $] euery hoastice would giue me such
a pasport as my hoastice of (^Staines^) : then would I not doubt
but to come to my iourneies end, with victuals inoughe in
my paunche, and no hurt to my person.
   [$Thus we went on our way, hauing worke sufficient to
coment on this controuersie, euen till we came to 
(^Basingstoke^) , where with the suns setting we tooke vp our lodging,
and with the beginning of the euening ended our daies task.$]
Now [$ (qd my mery companion) $] to requite your curtesie for
my dinner, find you meate and drinke, and I will find bread
to supper. And so if I finde to morrow as happy as this day
hath beene to me, I shalbe well pleased to heare you againe
to salute me with good morrow: otherwise the day shal haue
<P A4V>
my fauour to my fortune. [$And with that as mery as a man
with two penny loaues in his pocket, he steps into a tipling
house and askt for lodging, he was no sooner come into the
house, but there was one clad like a Caualier of (^Spaine^) , that
tooke acquaintance of him, saying:$] What (^Goodcoll^) my old
friend, my companion and familiar acquaintance, wel met,
I am glad to see thee in health: ho Tapster fill vs a dosen of
beere, for weele be mery yfaith: [$with that my companion
was wonderous iocond, and gratifying him with all the
reuerence he could deuise, with Italian and French
imbracements, sometimes about the middle, sometimes below
the knees: he requited his greeting in this sort:$] (^Iacke
Freeman^) , A plague on thee, who would haue thought to haue
found thee here? trust me by the faith of an honest man, I
am glad of this chance: And in respect of this happy
meeting, I blesse my fortunate starres that it was my lucke to
see thee before I die: And as thou louest me, bid this my
friend welcome and let vs suppe together: but (^Iacke
Freeman^) except your purse be better then mine, our cheere will
but mocke our stomackes, which at this time I should take
in as ill part, as my hoastice of (^Staines^) did my words this
morning. Tush feare not [$ (qd. (^Freeman^) ) $] if thou hast no
money, I haue enough both for me and thee, and yfaith thou
shalt not lacke as long as forty pounds last: why man I
thanke God I haue in this simple doublet (as I may say to
thee an hundred angels and vpward, and hang dogs. 
(^Goodcoll^) they shall be all at thy command. Godamercy my sweete
(^Iacke Freeman^) [$ (qd. he:) And with that we all sate downe to
supper: At what time they fell into great communication y=e=
one with the other. (^Freeman^) declared how he was newely
come out of (^Ireland^) , and what hurt the rebels had don there,
by setting diuers townes on fire,$] and now [$ (qd he) $] I am come
from visiting my friends in (^Hampshire^) , with purpose to go
directly to London. Therfore I pray thee tell me how doth
all our good friends there, and what is the best newes. In
troth [$ (qd. (^Goodcoll^) $] no newes but what is common: The
<P B1R>
good Earle of Essex is prepared to sea, and in sooth thither am
I going to: for what with my debts, and my wiues tongue
(before god) I am constrained to leaue all, for who would
liue in dread of those creepe corners, that gets their liuing by
playing boe-peepe, who like the cookcow haue neuer but one
song, and that sounds so ill fauouredly, saying: I arest you:
that I promise you it makes many a mans heart ake that
heares it. And whither I pray you trauels this honest man
your friend [$ (qd. he:) $] Truly [$ (said I) $] my iourney is       #
toward y=e=
sea too, though not for the like cause as my friend goes. For
as for my wife, her tongue did neuer displease me, because
she could neuer speake being borne dumb, and as for 
Sergeants, I neuer neede to feare them, for no man would euer
credite me to make me run in debt. Then hast thou [$ (qd. 
(^Freeman^) $] two good commodities. But hearest thou (^Goodcoll^) , I
pray thee say: how doe all our ancient acquaintance, y=e= good
oath-takers, or common baylers: (^Alias^) the Knightes of the
Poste, the Lords of lobs pound, and heires apparant to the
pillory: who are as ready to baile men out of prison, being
then well pleased for their paines, as (^Tiron^) is in playing
the traitour without causes. Tush [$ (quoth (^Goodcoll^) ) $] that
fraternity of falsehood, and fellowship of fraud, doth neuer
lightly passe out of the old byas, they are all in health, though
voide of honesty: some are at liberty to seeke a dinner where
they can get it: and some to spare shoe-leather lies in prison.
(^L.^) that old lad is foorth comming, though not co~ming foorth,
hauing the priuiledge to walke his stations in one of y=e=
counters in London, & so are diuers other of the same profession.
But tell me I pray you [$ (qd. (^Freeman^) ) $] what is become of    #
(^B.^) 
is he as sound mettle as he was: And how doth the barber
of new-corne, olde father (^C to-towne^) , (^L.^) the Courier, and
he whom men call worse then Craft, are they all liuing stil?
Liuing [$ (qd. (^Goodcoll^) ) $] trust me I, and like enough to liue
till shame either prefers them to the pillory, or misery ende
their daies. (^B.^) hath fou~ded false larums in Westminster hall
a long time, and hath been a graund Knight of antiquity: as
<P B1V>
well knowne for his profession, as mother Bunches ale to
nipitaty. But for the store houses of corne, he hath 
betaken himselfe to his beades: for in matters of bailing, he is
like an old horse, whose marke is neere worne out of his
mouth: but notwithstanding though he be feeble in body, yet
his minde is as good as euer it was, & that which he cannot
performe himselfe, he procures others to doe: like that
aunciente raine beaten harlot (^M, Ro^) , that after shee had quite
consumed her young yeres in lechery, and was no more set
by, yet for the loue she bore to the whorish art, procured and
inticed younger ones to doe it, and so became a notable
baude. And in like sort playeth he, for where he bayleth one
himselfe, he procureth others to baile three.
   But as concerning olde father (^C^) : why man hee is oulde
suresby, as trustie as steele, and one that alwaies helpes at
a deadlift: for after he hath smugd vppe himselfe in his
borrowed apparell, with his great seale ring on his finger of
pure copper and guilt, when he comes to baile a man before
a Iudge, being demaunded if hee be a subsidie man or no,
straight answeres, and it shall please your good Lordshippe,
I haue beene a subsidy man this xx. winters and vpward:
And then he sweares, that he was seized at v. pounds in the
Queenes bookes the last sessment of the subsidie: and furder
affirmes it on his credit, which is as good in cheapeside, as it
is at the puddingpy house, where they will not trust him for
two pence: but he hath one bad quality, which I doubt will
make him at length loose his customers, and that is this. He
wil neuer be pleased when he hath bailed one, except he giue
him more then his promise and beside stop his mouth with a
pint of old sack. Now sir he whom men call worse then craft
and L. I thinke they will giue ouer their trade of bailing, &
turne truemen, for they doe not so much vse it as they haue
done heretofore. Trust me [$ (qd. (^Freeman^) ) $] that would be as
great a miracle, as to see (^Bankes^) his curtaile dance a 
hornepipe. But what say you to little W, and to him that is called
more then a whole bare ow, and the man whose name hath
but fiue letters, first three vowels, then two consonants?
<P B2R>
Tut [$ (qd Goodcol) $] they be in these matters like Manering
at a buriall, of no reckoning, except to iest at: being rather
procurers of others then doers themselues. If you make no
account of them [$ (qd (^Freeman^) ) $] what say you then of him that
bore the name of the olde player with the veluet cap: of the 
aged-Crane turnde backewarde, (^K.^) with the tun, & (^F.^) w=t= the
firie face, (^C.^) the true cook-olde y=t= sold away his wife for 
money, & afterwardes receiued her home againe: mary qd. O.
as Tarleton saide of the Tinker, that they haue more craft
in their budgets, then crownes in their purses:
notwithsta~ding of no reputacion: for they be but procurers of       #
others to
baile, & not baylers themselues: And aboue all the rest: the
Kn. of the post, do vtterly deny to go befere a I. with (^F.^) for
feare least the fire in his face should set the I. chamber in a
flame: and so they might get more displeasure, then all the
rich rubies in his nose are worth. (^C.^) I must needes say is a
good fellow: but he vseth this trade nothing so much now as
he hath done: and as for (^K.^) he doth so tye himselfe to y=e= two
penny ale, that he can spare no time to do any thing. Then
tell me, how fares (^L. P. C.^) & (^El-col.^)                        #
[^"E" UNCLEAR IN SOURCE TEXT^] are they of no reputacio~
now? they were wont to be iolly doers in this geare: and so
are they still faith Goodcole, for (^L.^) and (^P.^) doe many matters
co~tinually & get much mony by it, but it prospers as badly w=t=
them as the coine that (^Iosephs^) brethren tooke when they
sould him into (^Egipt^) , for what is gotten all day they spend
franckly at night in on tauern, alhouse or other, soe that for
oght that I see, they are as bare as y=e= spanish friers that were
late taken at sea, which lie now in S. maratins but wheras
you speake of (^C.^) I haue not seene him a long time either I
thinke he is dead, or else gon to (^Reding^) againe from whence
he came, but why doo you call him (^C.^) his name is (^Cookoo^) ,
though he keepe not all waies on tune, truly that is more
then euer I heard [$quoth (^Freeman^) ,$] doe they then alter their
names when they goe a bout to baile men? as though that
you were ignorant therof [$qd. (^G.^) $] If they shoulde not change
their names, & like (^Protheus^) turne their shapes somtimes,
they woulde often be had by y=e= barke for their lewd knauery,
<P B2V>
But then I pray you tell me what is become of the broker,
the bird with the blacke foote and goulden taile, and the son
of (^R.^) doe they continue their oulde courses still? What
neede you moue such a question [$ (qd (^Goodcoll^) ) $] how should
they liue if they should leaue that sweete profitable trade:
bayling and swearing? I tell you sir it is an occupation
that foules not their hands, though it corrupt their
conscience, which some of them haue vsed these dozen or fourteene
yeres at the least. I muse [$ (qd. (^Freeman^) ) $] how these fellowes
scape vntaken or vnpunisht all this while, for it is on oulde
prouerbe, that the pitcher goes so long to the water, that at
length it comes broken home. Tush they are as heedeful in
this matter as may be, for as I tould you, they will seldome
tell their right names, nor giue true notice of their dwelling:
And beside that they will be sure to know before hand, what
Iudge it is that must take the baile: for if their be any iudge
that he knowes doth suspect him, he will keepe one leg back
from that place, and go before some other to doe the feat.
   Call you these feates [$ (qd (^Freeman^) ) $] for wretches to
periure themselues in this sort? truely god may well spare them
for a time, but their iudgement wil be the greater: and 
surely goods gotten in this sort must needes be cursed: And no
maruell if none of them doe thriue. Why doe you say so [$ (qd.
(^Goodcole^) ) $] is not the broker rich? I, but he got it by
brokery and not by bailing [$qd the other.$] I graunt he is a broker
[$ (qd. (^Freeman^) ) $] but he was first a bailer and a swearer,    #
which 
preferd him to his brokery: for it was a small matter insteed
of hearing morning praier to goe fasting before a I. and
forsweare himselfe, wherby he hath gotten many a crowne,
which hee accompteth cleere gaines and the stocke 
remaining whole at the yeeres ende: so that nowe hee hath lefte
brokery and is become a Draper. A Draper [$ (quoth. 
(^Freeman^) ) $] what Draper, of woollin or linnen? No [$ (qd he) $] #
an Ale
Draper, wherein he hath more skil then in the other: 
neuerthelesse there are more brokers that are bailers beside him.
Why is their owne trade of brokery so much decayed [$ (quoth
(^Freeman^) $] that they cannot liue by that, as well as they haue
<P B3R>
done? I [$ (qd (^Goodcoll^) ) $] there is so many of them, that one
ca~not liue by another: And beside that, there is another 
inconuenience befalne them: they must nowe neither buy any
thing, nor take pawne, except first they come and Register
it in a place prouided by the Maiestrats: so that whereas
before they were woont to buy much stolne goods, whereby
their greatest profit grew: now they cannot doe so, because
each party that brings goods to the brokers, must haue their
names & dwelling place set downe by the Register, or else
they that doe otherwise, are accounted axcessary to the
fellony, if they meddle with any stolne goods.
   This is an excellent good order [$qd ( (^Freeman^) ) .$] But what 
is that sonne of (^R.^) you spoke of? I haue heard much speeche
of him that he hath beene an notable fellow for bailing. No
(^Goodcoll^) and so he is still: but in speaking of him, I must
say to you, as once a King of England said to his Queene y=t=
was desirous to know a certaine matter of him: soft (qd he)
thereby hanges a tale: and so likewise of (^R.^) remaines 
another, but that I will referre till to morrow, for what with
this good supper, and my weary iourney, I find my selfe well
preparde for my bed, and therefore let vs know what we
haue to pay, that we may rise from the table, for I assure
you my legs are waxt as stiffe as an ould paire of bootes
after a nights drying. [$Then said (^Freeman^) ,$] Ho tapster whats
to pay? fiue shillings two pence [$ (qd he) $] and you are welcome:
[$with that I began to draw my purse, and (^Goodcoll^) went to
his pocket:$] Nay soft my masters [$ (said (^Freeman^) ) $] heres    #
not a
penny for any of you to pay: nor will I offer a penny [$ (quoth
(^Goodcoll^) ) $] but these, & with that he set the two loaues which
he pluckt out of his pocket on the board: this is an odde iest
[$ (quoth I) $] to set bread on the board after the meate is eaten,
much like vnto her, that went not for the Phisition before
she saw her husband dead vnder the table. If you like not my
offer [$ (qd (^Goodcoll^) ) $] I will keepe them till to morrow. Why
sir [$qd. (^Freeman^) ,$] it is written you should not care for the
morrow: tis true qd he, and because I will not care for to    
<P B3V>
morrow, I prouide these loaues to night. Then said I to 
(^Freeman^) , I beseech you sir accept of my money, otherwise you
will charge your selfe too much: You shall not spend a
farthing (quoth he) nor should not if we were together               #
[^SOURCE TEXT: toegther^] this
moneth: And trust me my hearts, were it not for one thing I
would walke along with you: but at Bristowe I did
disburse an hundred angels, to the good man of the Fryingpan
on the Bridge, to haue it paide me at London, the fifteenth
of I: nexte, or within seuen daies after the sight of his bill:
But [$ (said (^Goodcoll^) ) $] who must paie it to you there? Mary
(^Phillipp Curtoise^) , a man sure enough [$quoth (^Freeman^) .$] 
   I would to Christ [$said (^Goodcoll^) ,$] we might haue had your
company to (^Plimmoth^) , for I may say to you as to my friend,
I haue not one penny in my purse, whatsoeuer come: [$quoth
(^Freeman^) ,$] thou shalt not lacke for money: [$And with that he
drew his purse and gaue him ten shillings, saying:$] Hould
thee my ould friend, take this to helpe thee, and if I had
more store of white money, I promise thee thou shouldest
haue more, mary I thanke God I haue some charge about
me, more then I meane to make any man priuy to: And
to say the truth, I am loath to breake my gould, I haue left
my selfe fiue shillings yet in siluer, and that shall serue till I
come to London: [$And with that he calde the goodman of y=e=
house, saying:$] Good my hoast prouide me a good bed, and a
chamber with locke and key, for I haue charge about me.
   Sir [$saith the hoast$] feare not, you shall lie safe I warrant
you, if you had a thousand pound. Heare ye my hoast [$ (quoth
(^Freeman^) ) $] I pray you vse my friends well, I may say to you
they are honest men, and of good credit in London, though
as you see they trudge thus a foote, as my selfe doth. I tel you
they haue reason for it my hoast, and so haue I too: & harke
ye me, I pray you let them haue what they will call for, if
they will not pay you, I will. I thanke you sir [$ (quoth we) 
and so we departed to bed.$] 
   [$In the morning they rose early, and calling at (^Freemans^)
chamber dore, thought to take their farewell of him:$] What
<P B4R>
my boies [$ (quoth he) $] are you such good cockes to be rising as
soone as the sunne? Nay soft, we must not part so, I meane
to breake my fast with you, [$with that he started out of his
bed, and wiled the tapster to couer the board, so to breakfast
we went. Then said (^Freeman^) :$] now (^Goodcoll^) , I pray you
let me heare the tale of Rob: for I could doe nothing but
dreame all night what it should be: Mary [$ (quoth he) $] this R.
being his crafts Master, where he was hiered to come
before any Iudge to baile a man, it was his accustomed vse to
call himselfe by a wrong name: and if he dwelt in long lane
perhaps we would say he dwelt in white Chappell, and so
neither certifie them of his true name, nor of his true
dwelling place: so that if any enquiery bee made of him in such
place, where he affirmed himselfe to dwell, there is no such
man to be found: and by this means he scapes manie a
scouring.
   But pardon me I beseech you, good master (^Freeman^) , the
day weares, and I haue farre to go, therefore I cannot
stand to tell out the rest: but at our next meeting in troth you
shall knowe all: therfore let vs paye our shotte and be 
walking.
   A figge [$ (quoth (^Freeman^) ) $] here is nothing to pay, and were
our reckoning twentie pound, you should not pay one
penny: but because your hast is such towards your iourney, and
my desire great to heare out your tale, Ile take my sworde
and walke a mile or two with you: And thus hauing
discharged the house we went foorth together. Well now to
my tale [$quoth (^Goodcoll^) .$] 
[^GOODCOLL RECOUNTS A STORY ABOUT A MAN WHO BAILED HIS 
FRIEND BY GIVING THE NAME AND ADDRESS OF A RICH NEIGHBOUR, 
RATHER THAN HIS OWN.^]
<P B4V>
   At last by course of law an execution was like to be 
serued vpon the surety. The honest Cittizen hearing of this
matter, was not a little amazed: saith he to the Creditor,
Sir you greatly mistake, I am not the man you meane, for
I know no such man you speake off, nor was I euer baile
in this court in my life. Why is not your name thus: qd,
the Attourney your trade Vpholstery, and dwell you not in
such a place? Yes indeede quoth the Cittizen: well then,
except there be more of this name dwelling there, you are
like to answere vs (saide the Attourney. Tush said the 
Cittizen, as well he might haue put in my childs name as mine,
for any knowledge I had of this matter.
   Thus was this honest man put to no small trouble 
before he could cleare himselfe: while in the meane space the
Glouer sate smiling in his sleeue, and caried away twenty
or thirthy shillings for his paines.
   Vndoubtedly [$said I,$] he is a fellow of a filthy conscience:
Conscience [$ (qd (^Goodcoll^) :) $] I tell you their consciences are
like chiuerell skins, that will stretch euery way. But for
all the Glouer is so cunning, if he vse many of these feates,
at length he will come to peepe through the pillory, and
carry as many eares on his head as old Harry of P. gardine.
But where is P. now a daies, that goulden feathered bird,
he hath beene an ancient professor of bayling, & many great
aduentures hath he past, like a most hardy Knight of the
Post.
   I [$saith (^Freeman^) ,$] but he was like to haue catcht a foule
foile of late: for if he had beene gotten, he had beene clapt vp
in the Kings bench for his knauery: And how scapt he I
pray? Euen by his wittes [$said (^Goodcoll^) ,$] the which he hath
beaten thrid bare.
<P C1R>
   Also you know P. (^Alias.^) A. oulde R. not the fox, thougqh
much of his nature, B. and H? yes mary, what of them,
doe they proceede still in bayling, some doe, and some doe
not, for as I heard, good P. (^Alias^) A. ryding out of Towne,
broke his necke at Tyborne. And as he went to hanging,
R. stood by and would not bid him once farewell, 
wherevpon P. broke out into this passion, saying: Ah thou
ingratefull wretch, haste thou beene copartner of so many of my
profites, and dost thou now participat with my crosses, thou
haste sung with me, and dancst with me, eate and drunke
with me, and canst thou not finde in thy heart to hang with
me. Well, if thou hadst not that good nature in thee, yet
thou mighst haue toke the paines as to goe to the Gallowes
with me, or bid me farewell.
   An Officer ryding hard by him with a Iaueline in his 
hand, hearing him thus inuaye against his vnkinde friend,
wisht him to content himselfe with patience, for (quoth he)
though he will not take the paines to goe with thee now, yet
he meanes parhaps to follow thee shortly.
   It was well answerd to the discontented man [$ (qd. 
(^Freeman^) $] for the quyet of his minde, but how fares B. C. and
H. mary sometimes with bread and cheese [$ (quoth (^Goodcoll^) ,$] 
sometimes with bread and butter, and eate rostmeat when
they haue mony: Nay I inquire not after their chier, but
their good estate [$ (saith (^Freeman^) .) $] In troth they liue so  #
so, and
it were well, if they knew where a good commodetie of
names were to be sould, and yet I thinke all the mony in
their pursses could not buy it. 
   But to let these bace fellowes passe, I can tell you of a
great many others that you neuer knewe men lately come
into the trade, but I doubt we haue brought you too farre out
of your way already: Tut, I respect it not [$ (quoth (^Free.^) ) $]  #
and 
seeing I am come thus farre, I will walke along to
Andouer with you, because it trueth I would heare somewhat of
those men you speake of, for hang it vp, it is but the co~ming
backe of fifteene or sixteene myles, & there I will bestowe
<P C1V>
your dinner on you, and so returne, why then we shall be too
much beholding to your curtesie [$ (qd. (^Goodcoll^) ) $] but seeing
you haue so good a minde to heare of these matters, I will
proceede in my first purpose.

out of the roome, and came to the good man, saying, Sir we
haue gathered our reckoning, and lefte our money with our

somewhat early, breaking his ordinarie houre, is purposed to
take a nappe before he goe, and as soone as he wakes he will
pay you: for our owne partes we haue earnest busines that

no man doe offer him any wrong.

[^SOURCE TEXT: auswerable^] to
their apparell, and noting them by their countenance to be

made this replie.
   Very well Gentlemen, I doubt not my payment, and
doubt you not but I will haue good regard to the gentleman
aboue: let him take his rest on Gods blessing: well, God be
with you, sir qd. they: you are heartily welcome saide the
Vintner: nowe sir within some quarter of an houre after,
S. awaking out of sleepe, and seeing his companions to bee
gone, marueiled much thereat, wherefore hee calling the
<P C2V>
Drawer, presently answered with a shrill voyce, anon. anon
sir, when the Drawer came to him, he demaunded if all his
companie were gone out of the house, yes marry sir, said he,
a quarter of an houre agoe, and more, what churles were
they (quoth he) to goe and leaue me here, but seeing it is so,
take vp thy plate good Drawer, and with that he stept out
of the rome, nay soft sir (quoth the Drawer) I hope you will
pay the reconing ere you parte, haue not they payd (quoth
S. not ane penny, sir said the Drawer, then said S. with a
pale countenance, why tell me what is to pay, vnder ten
shillings somewhat sir answered the drawer, with that S.
bent his browes and fetcht his stations vp and downe the
rome, with such furious Iesture as if he had beene playing
Tamberlane on a stage: Drawer (quoth he) thou must
not thinke to make a younger brother of me, I knowe my
friendes would not serue me thus for twenty pound, I pray
thee goe call thy maister, the fellow runnes downe and tells
his maister how the case stood, the goodman incontinent goes
to S. who asketh him presently if he were not payd the shot:
no verely. said the goodman, your friendes tolde me at their 
parting that they had gathered the reconing and giuen you
the mony to pay: and haue they serued me so (quoth S.) wel,
heere is your mony, but I will take heede how I sleepe after
dinner againe: A small matter sir (quoth the goodman for one 
friend to iest with another. And so they departed, but this
bred no litle brable betwixt S. and K. when they met.
Certainely I could not blame S. to be offended (quoth (^Freeman^) )
to be so vnconscionably vsed by his companions, in a strange
place, but no doubt they payd him againe, that is hard to say
(qd, (^G.^) for some of them deale in paying their debtes. like
the Plannet (^Saturne^) , that finishes his course but once in 3.
yeeres, and they possible once in three liues.

the water ran through euery streete in the same cittie,$] and
I wil tell you what Gentlemen [$ (qd. he) $] you say y=t= you were
neuer there: but if you please to goe thither, there you shall
see the fairest Cathedrall Church (for the bignes) that is in
Englande, the first stone whereof, King (^Iohn^) w=t= his owne
hand did lay, and there is about the same church as many
chappels as there is moneths in the yere, as many dores as
their are weekes in y=e= yeare, and as many windowes as
there are days, and as many pillers as there are howers in

wearinesse with the residue of the discourse, nowe [$quoth           #

you shall here me discouer y=e= vilde practices of these bad
people, wherby they daylie abuse the graue Iudges of the land,
her maiesties high commissioners, and the Iustices of the
peace, especially these for (^Lond.^) Midls. K. and Sur. with y=e=
shires next adoyning, Stewardes of Courtes, and many
<P C4R>
other, both Honorable & worshipful: deceiuing likewise 
many poore men, by their most vilde & lewde practises: for now
they (as some of them can brag of) haue by y=e= continuall
practise thereof, made their trade of baileing, better by fiue C.
poundes a yeere, then heretofore it hath bine. [$Wherevpon
Freem. demanded how that coulde be:$] I will tell you sir [$qd.
Goodcole:$] They are growen now as I say, to baile men 
before her M. high Commissioners for causes Ecclesiasticall:
But if their vilanie be once found out in y=e= place, they will
be made to curse the day of their Natiuitie: that euer they
first began to take these lewd courses in hand. It seemeth
then [$ (qd. Free.) $] that they haue prettye fine wits, that they
can escape away so cleanly in their matters, & neuer be
taken tardie: Albeit [$ (qd. he) $] that their long practise in these
thinges, haue made them as subtile as Serpents: yet now
and then they are taken in their villanie, but that is verie
seldome: perhaps once in seauen yeeres.
   And now sir, I will shew you how that not long since, a
man that you know verie well, was clapt by the heeles in y=e=
Clinke, for baileing (as I supose) a Papist before the high
Commissioners: who as soone as he had goten his libertie,
got himselfe away, & (as I haue heard) could not be founde
as yet. what do they presume so audaciously to baile papists
too [$quoth Freeman?$] yes verily: They wil not sticke to e~ter
eyther Bond or baile for any man y=t= will giue them money.
   And what will not they do: if they may be well requited
for their paines? But say they, there we shall neuer be put
to our othes which is a good helpe vnto vs. And thus haue
they all the shiftes & deuises that may be deuised to help 
the~selues: But now they are growen more circumspect in their
dealinges, then they were woonte to be. In what sort [$qd.
Fr?$] They haue now taken this order amongst them, that
they will be sure to come before one I. but once in a terme,
because they will not be noted in y=e= Maiestrats eies, so that
the graue Maiestrates are not any way able to preuent it,
by reason of the multitudes of people y=t= come before them:
so that when any Kn. of y=e= post coms before any Ma. againe,
<P C4V>
he hath as cleane forgot his countenance, as the man he 
neuer sawe before: if it be so, [$quoth (^Freeman^) ,$] that they come
before a I. but once in a terme, their gettings must needes
be small, and I maruell how they can liue of it, [$whereunto
(^Goodcoll^) answered, that$] as they liue badde inough, so they
liue poore inough, fortune feeding the~, as (^Mosse^) did his mare,
through a hurdle, which made him take her so soone napping.
And through wante of meate many times they walke out
their dinner in Duke (^Humfrey^) his Allie, or else fetch a sleepe
vnder a pillar in Powles, onely to beguile hunger. And
although they make many other shiftes to get money by, yet
none of them dies rich men. And now I will shew you how
by a newe deuise which they haue gotten, they get many a
crowne. I pray you let me heare that [$ (qd. (^Freeman^) ) $] for 
nouelties breedes most delight. 
[^GOODCOLL NARRATES A STORY OF HOW THE KNIGHTS OF THE POSTE 
CAME TO HEAR ABOUT A YOUTH OF GOOD PARENTAGE WHO, HAVING
FALLEN IN WITH A BAD CROWD, ENDED UP INCARCERATED.^]
<P D1R>
[^...^] Alas poore fellow, qd. the knight of the 
poste, hath he no friendes in the Citie that will doe somewhat
for him, and bayle him forth till the Sessions come: he hath
many friendes qd the other, but he is ashamed to make the
matter knowne to them, fearing it shoulde come to his 
parentes eares: which he would not for an hundred pounds,
What qd. the K. hath he any thing to helpe himselfe withal?
In troth qd. the other, he hath small store of money, but he
hath good thinges to make money of. Why what would he
giue qd. they, to such as would procure his libertie and set
him out of danger, mary qd. the other he would giue foure
Angels withal his heart, in troth qd. they for sixe Angels, we
will for your sake finde meanes to fetch him forth: and put in
good sufficient men to be sureties for his appara~ce at the next
assises, but wee will haue our money readie to bee paid: but
wil not receiue one penny before we haue done it, you speak
like honest men qd. the other: I will thus much presume,
though without my friendes [^SOURCE TEXT: frieudes^] knowledge, that #
you shall haue
sixe Angels or three poundes in white money, so soone as it
is done: therefore I would wish you goe about it straight:
and because I know, you cannot trot about without 
expences, there is for a pottle of wine, and with that he throweth
them downe a shilling: desiring them to tell him where hee
should meete them at euening or in the morning: the place
being appointed, & themselues with all circumstances 
prepared, dressing themselues very handsomly, to a I. they go,
if he chaunce not to be within, then they trudge to another,
and doe not rest till they speake with one or other. And thus
with a very graue looke, and duetifull obedience they begin
to speake in this sort. We are come to intreat your good
Worship for a poore young man that is in prison, one that is
come of very honest parents though he be farre from them,
who by meere chaunce, lighting in company of some lewde
persons, was with them committed to Newgate, where the
poore young man, hauing been tenderly brought vp. through
the weakenesse of his owne nature, and the noysome smell
<P D1V>
of the place where he now is, findeth himselfe verie ill, & we
assure your Worship, that we feare if he remaine their any
longer, that it will be his death, wherefore we most humbly
intreat your Worship, that he may be bayled foorth, you
shall haue sufficient Citizens and good Subsedie men to bee
bound for his apparance at the next sisses, to answere what 
soeuer can be laid against him. The good Iustice noting
their speech, and therewithall their persons, makes this
answere, if his fact be no worse then you speake of, and you
seeme honest men that would not report an vntrueth, I am
contented to take baile, so you bring me good sufficie~t 
sureties: & if it shall please your good Worship (quoth they) wee
will be the men our selves, I assure you sir, we are subsedie
men both of vs, and our dwelling is in such a place, & with
that they protest that they were sessed at fiue poundes in
Queenes bookes, the last subsedie, whereupon the Iustice
bids his Clarke to take their bondes: [^---^]
[^BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTIONS, THE KNIGHTS OF THE POSTE BECOME
FAMOUS AMONGST THE CRIMINAL WORLD, AND WANT FOR NOTHING

<P D2R>
[^...^]
why then [$quoth (^Freeman^) $] it seemes by your speches, y=t= the
knights of the post and the cutpursses w=t= al such other leawd
companions are confederated together for I perceiue the
cutpursse is so kinde, that if he haue it, the knights shall not
want it? no I assure you [$ (qd. G.) $] for both those Scots are
growne into one leage of friendship, hauing sworne as need
requireth, one good fellowe to helpe another, and in his
aduersitie, no more to forsake him, then in his prosperitie: doe
all the knights of the post vse this practice                        #
[$ (qd. (^Free.^) ?) $] [$G.
answered,$] no not all, but some of them, especially those of
the midling or latest sorte, what is there such diuersitie of
them, yea too many [$ (said G.) $] who goe about as fishwiues
carrie Oysters, new and stale: But I pray you tell mee [$ (qd.
F.) $] what shift doe they make, when these persons for whom
they are bound doe not appiere, at the next Sessions or Gail
deliuerie? You shall vnderstand [$ (qd. G.$] that the K. do know
and are verelie perswaded, as a thing wherein they are well
experienced, that there is no doubt of that matter, for those
fellowes falling to their oulde trade againe (because they 
are so grownded in filching, cannot otherwise betake
themselues to any vertuous labour it is vnpossible, but they will
be aprehended, for one vilde fact or other, before the 
Sessions, so that he will be foorth comming sure ynough, 
wherby their bondes are saued. And it is to be noted that so long
as they stand bound for any of them, they wil not baile them
out againe, but suffer the law either to set them at libertie,
or se~d the~ to the gallowes, for they are as careful in this case,
as y=e= hangma~ is, to tye the halter fast, so that there can come
no danger to them in the world. Then I perceiue [$ (qd. (^F.^) ) $]
y=t= if a ma~, or a woma~, co~mit neuer so hainous offe~ce, except in
cases of treason, murder, & such like, he may be bayled out of
prison at any time if he haue acquaintance with any of
these fellowes, and haue store of moneye to helpe himselfe
withall, yea verelie [$ (said (^Good.^) ) $] & they doe not onely    #
baile
<P D2V>
men out of Newgate, but out of the Marshalsea, the White
Lyon, the Gatehouse at Westminster, Finsberie, 
Wentworth prison, and out of the counter in Southwark for debt.
Some they doe [$ (said (^G.^) ) $] but not many, for in these Courtes
they dare not aduenture in cases of debt, so bouldlie as in the
higher courtes, because the courses of law there, comes a 
great deale sooner for trialls, then in the rest. whereby an
execution comes vpon their backes, before they looke for it.
Then I perceiue [$ (quoth (^F.^) ) $] for all their haste they are
ouertaken sometimes. Why you must thinke, it is vnpossible
[$ (said (^G.^) $] they doing so many matters continually) but that
they should be taken and clapt by the heeles for some of them.
Now I pray you (^G.^) tell me where doe all these knightes of
the post dwell and inhabit, are they all Londoners? no not
the tenth man [$ (qd. (^G.^) ) $] for some of them dwell at Redding,
some at Ware, some at Colebroke, some at Staines, some
at S. Albones, some at Hartford, some further of, and some
neerer hand: Then [$ (said (^F.^) ) $] it is great maruill that they #
are
not refused when they come before the Maiestrate. seeing their
dwellings are so farre of, why I tould you [$ (quoth (^G,^) ) $] that
they neuer giue true notice either of their names or dwelling
place, and that they will knowe before hand, before what
Iudge they must goe, and also what danger there is in the
cause, before such time, as they will enter into the matter,
being as fearefull to be taken tardie, as the whelp is to lapp
hote porage.
   But is it possible [$ (quoth (^F.^) ) $] that these men, that are #
so
redy to forsweare themselues, wil be trustie in their dealings
to them that put them in trust: nay [$ (quoth (^G.^) ) $] I may tell #
you,
some of them vse these shiftes, when they haue little other
buisenes to goe from prison to prison, and promise poore men
to worke wonders for them, but they will not stur their foote
without some mony in hand, and when they haue once
fingerd it, they neither doe the parties good, nor paraduenture
neuer come to him againe, whereby he loses three thinges at

be so paid for an hundred pound But you tolde vs of 
another matter [$said (^Freeman^) $] as we came ouer the Playne: and
tis as plaine a matter as the Plaine of (^Salisburie^) [$saide the
poste.$] [$Then said his hoast:$] What was it? Marry [$qd. he$] one
there was of so kinde a nature, that hee woulde suffer any
good fellow to lie with his wife that lackt a wife: In
requitall whereof my Lord Maior of (^L.^) lent him a Cart to ride in
for nothing: and because the Cuckold was rich: no hornes
would serue his turne but golden hornes: and bearing
himselfe somewhat bragge of my Lords preferment: the proud
foole got on his hollyday cappe vpon a working day: whereby
euery boy perceiued his asses eares: and in this sort he rode
vp and downe the Citie till the people droue him away by
flinging of dyrt at him.
   And as he went one way I came another with
<P D4R>
purpose to bring you certaine newes of this matter, for
such goulden hornes as he wore, did I neuer see in
my life. And now my hoast, tell vs what we haue to
pay, [$then said (^Freeman^) to (^G.^) $] doo you lay downe mony for #
me,
and I will giue it you againe, I loue not to shewe my gould
in an In, for Tapsters and Ostlers (they say) are not 
alwayes the honestest men. But come my hoast [$ (saith (^Fr.^) ) $]
I was neuer in this Cittie before, and I would desire you,
to take the paines to goe with these my friends, & my selfe,
to viewe the streetes, & to see the minster, for I haue heard
great commendation of it, sir [$ (quoth the goodman) $] I am
content to walke with you, and to shewe you the minster, or
to doe you any other fauour, that I may: [$so when (^Free.^) and
his two friendes, with their hoast, had taken their pleasure
in walking vp and downe the Cittie, he would needs to
requite his hoastes courtesie, giue him a quart of wine at the
Grayhounde, which beeing as willingly accepted, as it
was kindelie offerd, into the Tauarne they went, where
they made their quart a pottle: Now the foote-post 
vnderstanding where they were, thought he would goe to catch a cup
of wine among them, and comming merely in, euen as they
were paying the shot, askt if they lackt companie,$] no but
we lacke wine [$ (quoth (^F.^) ) $] the worse lucke for me, [$said the
post,$] I would I had beene more forward im comming
hither, or you lesse hastie in drinking the wine, wilt thou not
giue vs a pint, [$saith his hoast,$] yes marrie will I, [$answered
the other, and with that he calles the Drawer, saying:$]
bring vs hither a pint: what shall it be sir, faire water [$ (qd.
the post) with that they all laught, saying: he would be at 
coste$] well [$answered (^Freeman^) $] I will giue this mery fellowe
a quarte of wine of [^SOURCE TEXT: wineof^] wine, for his good       #
companye to
day, I thanke you, sir [$saith the foote poste, and with that
sat downe among them, where what with one merrie Iest
or another, wine was called for in lustelie, At what time
in the middest of their Cuppes, M. (^Freeman^) swore hee
<P D4V>
would goe to (^Plimmouth^) with them foote by foote, so when.
the reckoning came to be paid, he requested (^Goodcoll^) again,
according to his accustomed order, to lay downe money for
him:$] by the masse [$qd. (^Goodcoll^) ,$] what with our supper and
this shotte, I haue but one groat left of my tenne shillings,
for it is no reason my hoast should pay any thing at all, or
this my friend either, and as for the foot-poste, you promised
him to giue him a quart of wine: That is very true [$quoth 
(^Freeman^) ,$] pay all (^Goodcoll^) at this time, and in faith for  #
that
odde groat which remaines, we will haue a freshe pinte of
sacke. [$Now when that was druncke, they went all to their
lodging.$]
   [$In the morning the foot-post was soonest vp: who calling
to the rest of his company: askt if they were almost ready
to walke: but (^Freeman^) had drunke so hard ouer night that he
had no liste to rise so timely in the morning: & as for
(^Goodcol^) his money was all gone and spent: therefore he woulde
not goe before his good friend (^Freeman^) : for my owne part I
woulde faine haue gone along with the foot-poste: but that
(^Goodcoll^) did earnestly intreat me to the contrary: 
whereupon I stayd: & at length (^Freeman^) rising he called straight
for something to breakefast which was soone prepared (for
he was still the Gentleman) so hauing something refresht
our selues we rose from the boord:$] pray [^SOURCE TEXT: pay^]       #
(^Goodcoll^) [$qd. (^Freeman^) $]
lay out for me: I can lay out no more [$quoth (^Goodcoll^) $] but
all: [$then (^Freeman^) willed mee to lay downe for them both,
which I did: and so taking our leaue of our hoast, wee set
forward on our iourney toward (^Shaftesbury^) .$]
   [$Whereupon trauailing by the way, we fell into our olde
accustumed talke: and amongst many other things: 
(^Goodcoll^) there told vs that the Kn. of the poste were marueilous
good companions when they had store of money: and howe
commonly they would be sure alwayes to haue money
before hand of him that should vse the~ though they did nothing.$]
   [$Then said (^Freeman^) to (^Goodcoll^) $] I had forgot to aske you
one question yesterday: & indeede the foot-post did breake off
<P E1R>
our talke, or else I had done it.
   I pray you tell me, where are any of these Kn. of the post
at any time to be founde: if y=t= a man shoulde happen to haue
neede of them? Truly, I assure you [$ (quoth Goodcole) $] if it be
in the tearme time, you may haue them most commonly in
Fleetstreete, about S. In, or else about Ch. lane: or else in
some of the pudding-pie houses at Westminster, or else at
the three legges there, and at one of these places (I say) you
shall be sure neuer to misse of some of them themselues, or
else of some of their parte-takers that are the procurers of
them. But if it be out of tearme time: you shall haue them
commonly, once or twice a day, walking in D. Humfreys
Alley in Powles, or at the Lion on the backe-side of S
Nichollas Shambles, or at the Rose in Pannier alley, or at y=e=
Dolphin in the end of Carter lane: and sometimes at the
Wooll-sacke in the same lane: and there lye crushing of y=e=
two-penny Ale-pot halfe a day together: but if you do misse
(as doubtles [^SOURCE TEXT: donbtles^] you cannot) to finde any of   #
the~ in some of those
places: yet there is a Bell (but in what place it may hang
I know not) that if it be toulled, or at least-wise Rong out,
it will with the sounde thereof, cause an hundred of them to
meete together, w=t=in three houres, to serue any mans turne
that hath neede. And I dare warrant you y=t= Mephostophilus
neuer haunted D. Faustus more, then these fellowes doe
those places: where they consume their time, & spend away
all their thrifte. But what doe they take ordinarilie [$qd. Fr.$]
for baileing of a man? All after as y=t= matter is [$ (qd. Goodc.) $]
sometimes more, and sometimes lesse, as they can make 
their bargaine.
   But as I haue heard [$ (quoth Fr.) $] that there are another
sort of Kn. of the poste, that will beare false witnes in any
mans behalfe that will hire them, such as came to sweare
against Christ, whose Storie is their shame: And albeit some
of them do make a shew of Christianitie: yet are they voide
of all feare of God, and of no religion at all: but let vs [$saide
G.$] leaue of speaking any furder of them at this time: and
at my comming backe from Sea I will make a great
<P E1V>
number of them be manifestly knowne to the world. [$With that
I that all this while lent earnest care to their talke, caste
forth my verdicte thus:$] it seemeth [$ (qd I) $] M Goodco. that
you & M. Fr. haue bine much conuersant w=t= these fellowes
because you know their names so well, & can open all these
matters so perfectly: I was conuersant with them so long
[$saide Good.$] that it grudged my conscience sore to see their
dealinges: and grieued my heart to be any longer in their
company: so did it mine [$saide Fr. and with that, there was
other footemen that ouertooke vs, which caused vs to breake
of our talke, but Goodcole vowed deeply, y=t= if euer it were his
good fortune to come from the sea againe: not only to double
what he hath spoken, but also to be a scourge for euer to all
such disceitfull persons: and so keeping company with the
rest y=t= ouertooke vs, we droue out our time till we came to
(^Shaftsburie^) , where M. Freeman caused me to lay out mony
againe for them both, saying he woulde change two or three
peeces of golde at (^Exceter^) & pay me all againe: but when we
came there, & that I had laide out all my money at his
request: not one penny or peece of gold, had he in the worlde:
but was faine to sell his cloake for very neede: where vppon
I was a little moued, to see my selfe thus serud in a strange
place, & asked him if he were not ashamed to come so far to
heare a tale, & to spend all his money too: and Goodc. on y=e= 
other side, was as blanke as my selfe:$] in troth M. Fr. [$qd he,$] 
you had neede now to go & receiue your money at Londo~, if
there be any for you, is your great store of gold come to this
reckning? no maruell but you should haue your cha~ber dore
lockt for feare of robbing. My masters [$qd. he,$] I haue
deceiued you as you suppose, but none is deceiued so much as my
selfe: and if w=t= patience you will heare me, I will shew you:
At the same time y=t= I landed at Brist. there was one w=t= me,
that came out of Ireland also: a man y=t= seemed to be of good
credite, who had an Irish boy to waite vpon him, & hauing
bine as he said long out of England, bent his iourney to
visit his friends in Lancashire: we comming ouer both in one
ship, made accou~t also to lie in one lodging: & he hauing as
<P E2R>
well as my selfe good store of money, bought him selfe a new
sute of Apparell at Brist. the which in my eie seeming faire
& good, I woulde needes straight way buye me y=e= like, which
when I had done, I to haue the residue of my gold sure,
fearing eyther to be robed, or deceiued thereof, ript y=e= lineing of
my doublet in diuers places, & therein basted my gold most
secretly, now y=e= gentlma~ & I, lying together that night, the
next morning he rose before me, and as it seemed, he put on
my doublet & left me his: which I thinke on my conscience
he did it simplie & vnknowne to him selfe, because he made
himselfe ready in my sight, and at his departure away, he
brought me vp into my chamber a pinte of metheglin, and
drinkeing to me he bad me farewell: now I supposing all
this while y=t= I had my own doublet on, made indeede no
other reckning: had therein great store of golde, but when y=t=
this morning I searched & found it not so, you may thinke
that I was not a little [^SOURCE TEXT: liltle^] grieued: therefore   #
my masters here
is the one halfe of that I had for my cloake, to bring you to
(^Plimmouth^) , & with the rest, I will trauell into Lancashire
to my gentleman, for my own doublet, and therefore till I
see you againe, adiew, and thinke hereafter no worse of me
then you haue founde, [$and so we parted:$] [^---^]
