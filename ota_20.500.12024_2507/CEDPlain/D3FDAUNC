[^GOODLAKE LOVES MARIANA: HE HAS KILLED HIS RIVAL, 
AND HIS FRIEND SPENCER ADVISES HIM.^]
<P 1.1.20>
[^---^] but you tell me no more [$ (sayes he) $] then what I
expected, and think he deserved, so that we
have more reason to lament his folly then his
death, but however [$ (continued he) $] the strict
Lawes lately made against duelling will hardly
admit of such defensory excuses, and though
he might fall justly by your sword, yet the
power of his friends will endanger your life, let
me therefore advise you to make all possible
speed out of (^England^) , and because I know not
how your slender fortunes may have furnisht
you, let me beg of you to accept this [$ (taking
down a little Cabinet from the Beds head, and
giving it me) $] as token of my love, which if I
live and have the happinesse to know where you
reside, I shall be most highly obliged if you
admit me to supply father, otherwise, if I dye I
shall dedicate some of my last breath to the
remembrance of our friendship, [^---^]
[^GOODLAKE FLEES, RETURNING SOME YEARS LATER TO FIND 
HIS FRIENDS SAD.^]
<P 1.1.24>
[^---^] alas Sir, [$said one of
them,$] our sorrow (if there be any here whose
lookes or other jesture may make you deem
them sorrowful) is no other then what is caused
either by the dulnesse of the weather, or some
unknown reason which we cannot be sensible of,
Alas Madam, [$said I,$] your goodnesse must
pardon me, if I doe yet believe, that so great a
dejection of spirit, (as I perceive in this whole
company) must necessarily proceed from some
greater occasion then the dulnesse of the
weather, which to me seemes pleasant, unlesse
[$ (said I) $] I be that unknown reason from whence
it doth proceed, [^---^]
[^GOODLAKE DEMANDS THE TRUTH OF HIS FRIEND SPENCER.^]
<P 1.1.25>
[^---^] Oh my deare friend [$ (said he fetching
withall a deep sigh) $] since I must tell you the
cause which I would not doe, did I not know
you a Person who could absolutely command
your passions; know that the very sight of you
encreased my sorrow, for your sake did I first
conceive it, and you are the only Person in the
World it most concernes. [$I was somewhat
startled to heare him say so,$] and what is it [$ (said I in
some passion) $] can make me so miserable that you
should thus have cause to grieve for me? is
(^Mariana^) turn'd inconstant? and hath she now
I am come home fraught with full hopes to
enjoy her, plighted her faith unto another? It
cannot sure be, oh no, [$ (replyed he) $] she
continued constant to you even to her last; to her
last? [$ (said I) $] and is she then dead? oh
Heavens! what cursed stars was I born under, thus
to conspire to make me miserable for ever?
Well (^Mariana^) since after so many delayes I
cannot enjoy thee living, I will follow thee to
death; [$and therewith drew my sword,
intending to have pierced my bosome, but was
<P 1.1.26>
hindred by my too pittifull friend;$] and what [$ (says
he) $] though (^Mariana^) was (whilst living) your
only comfort, what comfort will it be to you
to follow her in death, where you can have no
further hopes of conversing, whilst her constant
and innocent soule is fled to Heaven, when
yours, blackt with that hideous crime of selfe
murder, must necessarily be hurried to a
blacker region. Live, live, and live, so that since the
fates have denyed you to enjoy each other here,
you may enjoy eternal Society hereafter, [^---^]

<S SAMPLE 2>

[^SPENCER IS IN LOVE WITH A LOW-BORN WOMAN; GOODLAKE SPEAKS:^]
<P 1.1.37>
[^---^] will you now leave this glorious
enterprize wherin you have engaged your selfe, and
whereon your eternall honour may depend to
tye your selfe here at home to a Person so much
beneath you in birth and fortunes, a (^Tanners^)
Daughter, a Tavern Servant, one who
perhaps only sensible of the passion wherein you
burn for her, counterfeits a chastity to you
whilst in this publique place she prostitutes her
selfe to others, Doe not [$ (sayes he in
extremity of passion) $] prophane so much goodnesse, my
very soule tels me she is all virtue, nor can I
think but my gifts and promises which I believe
have been greater then any others would tempt
her were her spotlesse virtue to be corrupted,
In sum sayes he, should the General himselfe
but tell me she were vicious, I would make him
feel the point of my sword, which I shall as
readily draw in defence of her honour, as of my
own life; therefore by the inviolable friendship
contracted between us let me beg you to desist,
from further mentioning her birth, or
<P 1.1.38>
blemishing her fame, for my eares are not capable of
hearing any other sound, then that she is faire
and virtuous; [$to which I (seeing him so
resolute) replyed, that what I spake, was but the
advice of a true and cordial friend, who prized
his honour as my own, but since I found him so
absolutely determined in his love to (^Besse
Bridges^) , (for so was that faire Maid called) I would
not only desist to perswade him from it, but
assist him what I could in it, but withall advising
to make some farther tryal of her, and not point
blanck to marry her, for he might easily be
sensible how great a blemish it would be to his
honour, if she should afterwards be found tainted:
He was so rejoyced to heare these comfortable
words of mine, (for so he termed them) that
clapping his armes about my neck, and kissing
me,$] oh now [$sayes he,$] I know thou art my friend
indeed, but how is it possible [$ (sayes he) $] that I
can make a tryall of her farther, the Fleet being
almost ready to depart, and no excuse can I in
honour make to stay here when they are gone,
you must venture that Sir, [$ (said I) $] it may be
before the departure of the Fleet somewhat
may happen, which may give you occasion both
to make tryall of her love and honesty, [^---^]
[^SPENCER KILLS A MAN WHO ATTACKED HIS LOVE, AND TRIES 
TO KILL HIMSELF.^]
<P 1.1.39>
[^---^] how [$ (sayes he) $] can you speak me a word of
comfort, who am reduced to this miserable
condition, for my inconsiderate rashnesse has not
only burdned me with the black stain and guilt
of murder, and hath laid me open to an
ignominious death, but that which above all grieves
me, forces me to lose the presence of a love
so faire, so sweet, so good, so chast, so virtuous
that the World cannot parallel her, oh (^Goodlake^)
tell me not then of comfort; Alas Sir [$ (said I) $]
'tis true you have laid your selfe open to all
these inconveniences, but yet the way shun them
or at least remedy them is not this, immoderate
griefe, if you stay here the law as you say will
very speedily pursue you, and what comfort
will it be for you to see me dye with you, could
I dye for you, I should let the World and you
<P 1.1.40>
know and see how willingly and undauntedly I
would sacrifice my life for so good a friend,
come Sir cheare up your spirits, there may yet
be remedies to all these miseries, fly and secure
your selfe; Fly and secure my selfe [$ (said he) $]
why that is my greatest misery that I must be 
forced to do so, and leave my love behind me;
That may be but for a short time [$ (said I) $]
remember that others (my selfe) have been made
subject to the same frownes of adverse fortune,
let those arguments of yours which were too
powerfull for me to gainsay the flying from my
deare (^Mariana^) , now prevaile with you,
besides [$ (said I) $] you have now an occasion offered
to make tryall of your Loves fidelity, and
whether she be worthy those attributes which you
are pleased to give her. And art thou still
doubtfull of her virtue? [$ (said he, raising
himselfe from the Bed) $] thou shall see me make such
tryall of her constancy, as shall make thee
declare her worthy not only of mine, but of the
love of the greatest Prince in (^Europe^) , but alas!
[$ (continued he) $] how do we feed our selves with
fancies? how is it possible that we should
either speak with, or send to her, for that trouble
not your selfe, [$ (said I) $] but give me your ring
and I will undertake to rid you of that care, [^---^]

<S SAMPLE 3>

[^SPENCER APPEARS TO BE DYING, GOODLAKE SPEAKS:^]
<P 1.1.53>
[^---^] O Lord! sir, [$ (said I) $] think not that I
have or can have any power to obey any
command whatsoever, except it be to follow you in
death; but why should I talk of death since
there is yet hopes that you may live, and I live
happy in the enjoyment of your friendship;
flatter not your selfe [$ (said he) $] with any such
vain thoughts, for I find death to have even
already seazed me, but let me command you
live, that since I must die I may rest in peace;
since then [$ (repli'd I) $] you think my life
necessary to the quiet and rest of your soul, I shall
endeavour to live, if it be but so long as till I
fulfilled your injunctions, which be they what
they will, I here protest by those indissoluble
<P 1.1.54>
bonds of friendship which have been so often
confirmed betwixt us inviolably to perform;
[$here I stopped, expecting what he would
enjoyn me, but he first desired me to take out of
his pocket a bundle of Papers wrapt up in a
scroule of parchment, in which sayes he you
will find my last Will and Testament; I
according to his desire took out the bundle and,
having found it out,$] what is your further
command concerning this [$ (said I) $] That Will [$ (said
he$] I confirme my last, therein thou wilt find
that I have divided my whole estate between 
thee my dear friend, and my beloved (^Bess
Bridges^) , but with this proviso, that if thou
shalt find her in the least tainted, or to have
falsified the faith wherewith she made her self
mine, that five hundred pound (^per annum^)
which I had resolved to estate her in, let me
beg of thee likewise to accept, and in requital
of it to obey these easie commands; First, That
thou wilt restore this Ring to my beloved (^Besse^) ,
the last pledge she gave me of her faith, which
if she have kept intire, will rejoyce her heart,
and ease it somewhat of griefe for my death, if
not, 'twill be a strong witnesse against her to
condemn her as the most light, inconstant, and
very woman, in the world; secondly, That if
thou shalt find that she hath either broke her
faith, or forfeited her honour, thou wilt not
fail to take from her my picture, which how
unworthy soever, is too good to be enjoyed
or breathed on by one unchast; and thirdly,
that thou wouldest make what hast possible
<P 1.1.55>
thou canst to the ship, least thou lose the
opportunity of this passage, and leave me to my
fate, farewell; Farewell? [$ (said I) $] O ye
Heavens! and is (^Spencer^) then so unkind as to
command me from him? this command doth more
afflict me then when he bid me live; for
without his presence I am but dead in my own
conceit, but to be forced from him when he is
even ready to render his soul to heaven, is worse
then death! either [$ (said I) $] command me not
from you, or command me not to live: If
[$ (said (^Spencer^) ) $] the peace of my mind were not
concerned in your absence, I should be as
unwilling to be deprived of you, as you seem
willing to die for my sake; but since neither
my dying desires, nor our former ties of
friendship can work upon you to leave me, I
must rest content, and as well as I can, pacifie
my spirits: Nay, now [$ (said I) $] you are unjust,
if my earnest love made me speak somewhat
disgustfull, what reason have you to blame me?
I will go, but who shall then close up your
dying eyes? who shall see you interred? what
friend shall weep a tear upon your funerall
hearse? must it be added to the rest of my
torments, that I cannot perform the last duty of
a friend to you? for that [$ (said he) $] trouble not
your selfe, and ad not your afflictions to the
heap of my miseries, you are not the first that
has lost a friend, but the first [$ (repli'd I) $] that
ever lost so faithfull a friend, farewell, for I
cannot stay here and obey your commands, 
farewell; [^---^]

[^THE STORY OF SCIARRA.^]
<P 1.2.27>
[^---^] [$ (^Schiarra^) mistaking a Coach, which
he thought to belong to one of our peculiar
friends, lifted up the curtain, but seeing his
mistake, he craved pardon for his unwilling
offence, which he thought had been granted, but
such was the rage of the Gentleman, who
accompanied onely with one Lady was in it, that
though at present he expressed not his disgust,
yet he awaited his revenge, which my forced
departure into the City about some urgent
occasions, gave him better opportunity of
effecting, for having traced careless (^Schiarra^) into a
private walk, he very rudely conjures him to
draw; (^Schiarra^) was so amazed that he could
not a first finde any answer, but that he
believed the Gentleman was mistaken: But the other
with a kinde of Spanish (^Bravado^) , answers, that
he should finde his eyes had found out their true
object, and that if he refused to draw, he
would send his coward soul to hell.$] Sir, [$replied
(^Schiarra^) ,$] you seem to be noble, and by your
garb should be at least a Gentleman, but you
must give me leave to admire your judgement,
that so rashly seeks a quarrel with me, who I
am confident never injured you, nor to my
knowledge ever saw you before, but let me
but know the reasons induce you to it, and
you shall quickly finde I am no coward; [$all the
reason in the world could produce no other
answer from the furious Gentleman, then that he
had offered him am affront, which he was
<P 1.2.28>
resolved to revenge, and therefore advised him to
draw, otherwise his sword should force him;$]
well [$answered (^Schiarra^) ,$] since I must of
necessity make trial of your valor, I shall endeavor
to make you repent it; [^---^]
[^THEY DRAW SWORDS; SCHIARRA WOUNDS THE GENTLEMAN.^]
[^---^] now Sir, [$said (^Schiarra^) ,$] you
will be pleased to give me a reason why you
were so desperately and rashly valiant? [$Scarce
had he ended those words, when he might hear
the cries of some Lady, piercing his ears, and
looking about, might perceive one running
towards him, and crying,$] Oh! for pity sake save
my dear (^Lorenzo's^) life, or if nothing but blood
can satisfie your fury, sacrifice mine in stead of
his to your victorious arm; [^---^]
[^THE LADY EMBRACES SCHIARRA BEGGING FOR THE GENTLEMAN'S LIFE:^]
[^---^] Do not noble Sir,
[$said she,$] let the tears and prayers of an
unfortunate Virgin, who never sued before, be now
<P 1.2.29>
spent in vain, but redeem the dear forfeit of
my brothers life, or if you yet be so cruel that
nothing but gore can cancel your anger, here,
here sheath your bright weapon between these
white breasts, this blood may sooner quench
your ireful heat! Oh! let me die, so he may
live! [^---^]
[^SCHIARRA TRIES TO RAISE THE CRYING WOMAN FROM THE GROUND 
BUT SHE REFUSES.^]
[^---^] Oh! no Sir, here
will I for ever lie prostrate, till you confirm my
boon, and grant (^Lorenzo^) life: [$to which (^Schiarra^) 
seeing she would not rise, kneeling likewise
down; replied,$] Goddess, for so your celestial
beauty, and Angelical voice confirm, yea,
pardon my inconsiderate rudeness (the childe of
my astonishment to look upon so divine a
presence) that hath permitted you to kneel and
beg that which you may command. I am no
Goddess, [$replied she,$] but a hapless Virgin, who
here lie prostrate for my brothers life. How
readily Madam, [$answered (^Schiarra^) ,$] would I grant
your boon, but that I fear by it I shall be too
soon exiled from the blessing your presence so
fully affords me. Will you not then let him
live? [$replied she:$] Yes Madam, [$said he,$] he
must live since you command it, and happy,
thrice happy 'tis being vanquished to have so
fair a saver; would Heaven had made his sword
<P 1.2.30>
my Conqueror, so I might then have deserved
so divine a pity; Rise Madam, rise, and receive
your brother, but let me now beg one boon of
you to know vvhat made him my enemy? It was,
[$said she,$] your lifting up the curtains of our
Coach, which though you excused, he in heat
of blood pursued you to seek revenge. 'Twas
a mistake Madam, [$answered (^Schiarra^) ,$] that made
me so discourteous, which I will yet redeem
with my life when ever you shall please to
command it. 'Tis too great a forfeit Sir, [$answered
she,$] for so slight an offence, let me now onely
beg your help to lift my brother into the Coach, [^---^]
[^THE WOMAN AND HER BROTHER LEAVE. SCHIARRA'S FRIEND ARRIVES 
AND ASKS WHAT HAS HAPPENED:^]
<P 1.2.31>
[^---^] Yes my dear (^Spinala^) , [$said he,$] I have met with
one who hath robb'd me of one of my choisest
Jewels, I am undone, for ever lost. Fie, [$said I,$]
this is passion, fancy not to your self a misery
when none attends you, what is it thou hast lost?
Lost, [$replied he,$] I have lost my self, but what
is more I have lost you. Me, [$said I,$] Hell it self
is not capable of robbing me of so high priz'd a
friendship, dear friend dally not thus with me.
Alas! Alas! [$said he,$] Heaven knows I dally
not, and that you may know I am serious too,
here take my sword, and sacrifice me to your
just revenge. I must be sensible of an injury
first, [$said I,$] for I am confident none but your
self can accuse you. True, [$said he,$] none but my
self and this treacherous heart of mine can be
witness against me, I have forfeited all those
Obligations of friendship, in which you have 
bound me, these traitorous eyes of mine have
ruined me. Prethee how, [$said I,$] undeceive thy
self, this cannot be other then a delusion. Would
to Heaven, [$said he,$] it were so. but let me tell
you plainly, and then I am confident you will
your self, without my intreaty, be ready to take
my sword and make me a just victime to the
wrong I have done you. Alas! [$said I,$] my dear
(^Schiarra^) , what can it be that can make thee
thus to fancy thou hast wronged me? thy soul
can never contract a guilt so great but I shall be
as ready to pardon it as you have been slow in
delivering it. Talk not of pardon, [$said he,$] for in
confidence that you will revenge it with my
blood, I will impart it. 'Tis this assume 'tis this
<P 1.2.32>
all those shows of Love which I have made to
your virtuous Sister are vanished into Air, that
bond which should have bound fast our
friendships to eternity, is broken, utterly broken, for
I now pay my devotions to another Saint. [^...^]
[^SPINOLA IS AMAZED:^]
[^---^] Do but,
[$said I,$] again confirm this disloyalty, and you
shall not need to beg me your Executioner. By
the hopes I have, [$answered he,$] that you will
take a just revenge upon me, all that I have
told you is true, my heart is stollen by another.
And canst thou perfidious man, [$said I,$] then leave
my sister languishing, whom thou hast betrayed
into so ardent an affection of thee, here take 
thy sword and defend thy self. I will receive it,
[$said he,$] not to make resistance, but in assurance
that it will provoke you to make me fall by
yours, strike then, and let out this treacherous
blood. [$I could willingly, I confess, have made
him an oblation to my poor Sisters Love, and
the honor of our Family, but the sacred name
of friend so often vow'd between us, begat a
palsie in my blood, and withheld my arm, so
<P 1.2.33>
turning from him:$] no false man, [$said I,$] I'le not
become thy butcher, Heaven shall work thy
ruine, for be assured, who ever thou now makest
thy Spouse, will proove a faithless Strumpet;
[$At these words I was going away, but he called
after me, crying,$] thou liest, return, I'le now
fight not in my own defence, but hers whom I
adore, for know she whom I now love is one
whom thou oughtst not mention unless with
reverence on thy knees, one whose heavenly
looks would tempt a Hermit, who had spent his
whole life in contemplation, nay, for whom
Angels would desert their bliss, and count it a
greater happiness then Heaven to enjoy her;
return, for wert thou arm'd with thunder, this
sword should reach thee. [$These words gave me
assurance that he was irrevocably lost, I began
to consider that more sisters I had, more friends
so worthy were not to be found, and therefore
returning to him,$] come Sir, [$said I,$] sheath your
sword, and know I pity you, and if my service
can assist you in gaining your new love,
command it. Alas! my dear (^Spinola^) , [$said he,$] this
is worse then killing me, to tantalize me thus,
for I know thou canst not so much wrong thy self
and sister. I do think, [$replied I,$] you have
never found me faithless, by all the Gods, by all
our vow'd friendship, not all my sisters wrongs,
shall make me prove disloyal to you, let me
then know who is now thy Mistris, that I may
assist thee in obtaining her. Am I then, [$said he,$]
yet so happy in my misery? Talk not, [$said I,$] 
farther of misery, for thou shalt be fully happy, if
<P 1.2.34>
all my skill and power can effect it, let me first
know your Saint. Alas! [$said he,$] that's my
misery that I know her not, yet 'tis she that was in
the Coach we this day overtook: 'tis then, [$said
he,$] the fair (^Florelia^) , daughter to the Marquesse
of (^Senazzaro^) , so fam'd for beauty over all the
(^Genouese^) Territories. Be comforted dear friend,
[$said I,$] for my acquaintance with (^Gilberto^) , 
Steward to (^Sanazzaro^) , shall easily procure your
admittance, come and you shall easily perceive
how zealous I will be in thy service. Heaven,
[$answered he,$] be propitious to our designs, [^---^]
[^SPINOLA GOES TO SANAZZARO'S PALACE AND PERSUADES GILBERTO TO LET
SCHIARRA VISIT FLORELIA: GILBERTO IS RELUCTANT AND DISCLOSES THAT 
FLORELIA IS SOON TO BE MARRIED TO ANOTHER.^]
<P 1.2.35>
[^...^] Do but name him, [$said I,$] and
assure your self he is seal'd for dead. 'Tis, [$said
he,$] (^Petruchio^) , eldest son and heir to the (^Count de
Ligue^) ; in the mean time do you and your 
friend come to morrow night with some
Musick to her chamber window, and doubt not of
gentle audience.
   [$I returned to my friend with joy, to have
effected thus much, who embracing me, and
calling me the Author of his happiness, told me,
that he had likewise discovered somewhat which
would not displease me.$] What is it, [$said I,$]
Prythee? why, [$says he,$] no sooner was I come
home, but (^Catharina^) your sister (^Isabellas^)
servant calling me aside, began to tell me very
seriously, that she was sorry she must be
messenger of such ill news, desiring me to arm my self
with a noble patience, and not let passion grow
predommant at the hearing it. I began to muse
what it should be, and feared nothing more then
that thy sister (^Isabella^) having discovered my
falshood, had chalked out some path for
revenge; but those fears were soon dissipated, by
the maids telling me, almost with tears in her
eyes, that (^Isabella^) had forgot all he loves to
me, and now doted on the (^Lorenso^) son to the
Marquis of (^Sannazzaro^) , whom she had onely
espied out of a window carrying in a chair to be
dressed of a wound he then seemed to have
newly received. I easily [$ (said (^Schiarra^) ) $] guessed
<P 1.2.36>
it to be the person whose life my (^Florelia^) had
begged, and so was I rejoyced at the news that
I could hardly feign to her to be troubled, which
I thought fit to do. You did well, [$said I,$] to do
so, but you must now think of going to
entertain your Mistris, [^---^]
[^SCHIARRA AND SPINOLA TOGETHER WITH MUSICIANS PLAY AND SING
OUTSIDE FLORELIA'S WINDOW: SHE ASKS WHO IT IS.^]
<P 1.2.37>
[^...^] It is one,
[$answered (^Schiarra^) ,$] whom you (when for your sake he
saved your brothers life) promised so much to
honor as to keep in memory. If you be he,
[$answered (^Florelia^) ,$] I confess I am obliged to honor
your Nobleness, but you must excuse me if at
these untimely hours I dare admit no
conference, your Musick Sir, I thank you for, and so
much do I love you that I would not endanger
you, for if you should be seen here, your life
would run a hazard, therefore farewel: [$here
she was about to shut the window, when
(^Schiarra^) with a passionate voice cried out,$] for Loves
sake, stay (^Madam^) , for were there here dangers
as thick as there are Stars above us, nay were
<P 1.2.38>
even death it self, here I would scorn his fury,
and believe that whilest you stay, I am by your
presence made immortal. I am content,
[$replied she,$] lest you should condemn me of
discourtesie to stay, but you must then be brief
in telling me what you desire. Oh! Madam,
[$replied (^Schiarra^) ,$] confine me not to such hard
terms, and yet why should I crave greater
license since all I wist for is summed in these few
words, Madam, I love you, and desire your
love. And is that all, [$said she,$] then Sir farewel,
[$and herewith she made a second proffer to shut
the window, and had done it, had not (^Schiarra^)
withheld her by crying;$] Oh Madam! let me
conjure by the blood, which yet for your sake
flows in your brother veins, to stay and hear me
further. That charmes me for some time,
[$replied she,$] but consider, I pray, both your
danger and mine, and therefore conclude with
speed. Know then Lady, [$continued (^Schiarra^) ,$]
that my zeal could tell you, that you are above
expression fair, that your eyes illuminate the
night, and Eclipse the Stars in their greatest
brightness, that you are the Master-piece of
Nature, in which she strove to wed Art and
Beauty together, but these terms though they 
want nothing of truth, yet are onely fit to be
used by those whose loves lie in their lips, my
deeds shall speak the truth and constancy of my
love. Should all the actions in the world
confirm your love, [$answered (^Florelia^) ,$] I must still
return you the same answer that I dare not,
cannot love you, for my more honest thoughts
<P 1.2.39>
permit me not to deride your passions with
frustrate species, or flatter them with vain hopes,
but as you have been brief in your desires, I
will be the same in my denial; in confidence
of the truth of which, I desire you to rest
satisfied, and assure your self, that whilest you persist
farther in it, you do but plough the seas, and
write in the sand. You are noble, [$answered
(^Schiarra^) ,$] thus to rid me of my torment, and
not permit me languishing to burn in those hot
tortures, behold this blade, which once for your
sake did refrain from shedding your dear
brothers blood, shall now make me a victime to
your cruelty, [$and here-withall he was about to
have sheathed his sword in his bosom, and had
doen it, had not I who stood hard by perceiving
his intent, ran to him and stayed his arm, which
(^Florelia^) perceiving,$] Fie, [$said she,$] what a
fainthearted soldier are you thus to despair at the
first repulse, grant that I could affect you, would
you not account me light should I at the first
assault be won, before I had made any
experience of your faith and loyalty; nor can I
without my fathers consent adventure to love any,
get that, and you may perchance finde 
heartroom in my breast. Me thinks those words,
[$replied (^Schiarra^) ,$] return me to a new life, me
thinks the enamoured Stars hangs o're thy lips,
expecting a blessing from them. Be not too hasty
Sir, [$said (^Florelia^) ,$] for it is yet impossible I should
love you, being already contracted. And yet 'tis
in your power, [$replied he,$] to love your servant.
Well, [$said she,$] I can hold out no longer, and if
<P 1.2.40>
what Anatomists write, that in the Center of our
hearts, there is a little concave where resides
our best affections, be true, then is your Augury
a divine truth, for all the love lies therein
engaged to the worth of another, not to the
jealousie of him to whom my father hath
contracted me. May I be so happy Madam, [$said
(^Schiarra^) ,$] as to receive from your sweet lips the name
of the person whom you are pleased to make so
blessed? Know then Sir, [$said she,$] for I can no
longer conceal it, but let the night yet shroud
me with a blacker cloud, to hide from you the
blushes of my face, that from the first time I
saw you, and observed the nobleness of your
temper, in saving my brothers life, which he
had rashly forfeited to your just revenge, I
become a true devotarist to those vertues which to
me seem'd heavenly: [$Here she made a small
stop, expecting that (^Schiarra^) should return some
answer, but into such an extasie had his joy
transported him, that he was not so sensible of his
happiness as to return a due thanks for it, when
his silence gave (^Florelia^) occasion to continue
thus;$] I fear Sir, my to soon yielding to your
desires has abated, or utterly extinguished that
love you but now zealously protested to bear
me, but if it have, I can but blame my own
credulity; [$farther she would have proceeded, when
(^Schiarra^) recollecting himself, interrupted her by
crying out;$] Oh! Madam, do not believe my
silence to proceed from any other cause then
the exuberance of my joy, your words have
ravisht me beyond my hopes, and made my
<P 1.2.41>
heart too narrow to contain that bliss, which now
you have made it entertainer of. Then Sir,
[$replied she,$] excuse my jealous mistake, and if
you please walk round about the house, my maid
shall attend to give you entrance. I will flie to
such happiness Madam, [$said he,$] [^---^]

what 'tis hath prompted you to this madness.
You shall finde 'tis not madness but justice,

to court my (^Florelia^) , mine I call her, since
both her self and father have confirm'd her so.
Dare Sir, [$replied (^Schiarra^) ,$] 'tis I dare do it, and
will, what darest thou do to oppose it? I dare
<P 1.2.42>
Sir revenge it, [$said he,$] but first I'le tell that
wrong you do both heaven and me, in striving
to deprive me of my betrothed Spouse, she is
mine, nor can she while I live be any others.
This sword shall clear my passage to her,
[$replied (^Schiarra^) ,$] and since you must have a
Mistris, I'le send you to choose one amongst the
Infernal deities. Dear friend, [$said he, turning
to me,$] put up your sword, this glorious quarrel
doth concern none but my self; come Sir draw,
[$ (again to (^Petruchio^) ) $] and let our weapons decide
whose she must be. Stay Sir a little, [$said
(^Petruchio^) ,$] you seem a person well qualified, and
let me with your badness of your cause chill that
blood which flows so violently in your veins,
consider that with your blood you strive to
ravish her from me, who both by her self and
father hath been confirmed mine, before whole
quires of Saints and blessed Angels; let not
your lust then blinde you to run head-long to a
sin so horrid and abominable. Oh! Sir, consider,
and hazard not your souls salvation on a quarrel
so unjust, should it be my fate, as in justice it
must be, to kill thee, consider what a masse of
endless woe (hast thou no other sins to charge
thy conscience with) thou pluckst upon thy head,
sure this must cause an earthquake in thy blood.
I am no School-boy, [$replied (^Schiarra^) ,$] to be thus
Catechized, words are to weak to force me
from the love of the Beautous (^Florelia^) , if you
will enjoy her you must fight for her, which
with what reason you can do, when you know
that after your sword has gained her from me,
<P 1.2.43>
you must likewise force that will which cannot
love you; come Sir prepare your self, or resolve
Lamb-like to die her sacrifice. Since you are so
resolute, [$replied (^Petruchio^) ,$] this sword shall
quickly finde your heart, [$and therewith
drawing made a sudden thrust at (^Schiarra^) , who as
nimbly avoided it, and with the point of his
weapon found a smooth way to his enemies

and died, and (^Schiarra^) glad that it was done
with so little noise, and I proceeded to finde
our entrance into the house, at the back door of

that this Bumbast Captain is any thing but an
empty vessel, that all his boasts and

make tryal of him; and if you will but furnish
me with Clothes and a Sword, attired like a

doubt it, I will trouble you no further, but
request this courtesie of some one else. Nay, [$said
I,$] if you be resolute, I shall assist you what lies
in my power: but had you not better let me do
this, than hazard your self? suppose he should
fight, what resistance is your tender arm able to
make? Fear not, [$said she,$] I cannot in the least
suspect he will dare to oppose me, but if he do
you shall see I will not yield basely. I laughed
heartily [$ (said (^Forcet^) ) $] to hear her so confident,

vvith an angry countenance, wherefore he had
jostled her? To which my roaring Captain very
submissively replied,$] Indeed noble Sir, I hope

her lamenting over the Picture of her beloved

I might hear her say;$] It cannot sure be true that
thou art dead my (^Spencer^) , death could not be
so cruel to take thee in thy prime! but if he
hath, how happy is that earth that doth contain
thy breathless corps, how do the cold clay
incircling thy tomb, rejoyce that it's a neighbor to
so noble corps! Oh! that I were so happy to
lye by thee, but since that cannot be, I'le study
how to dye, that though our bodies lie at this
vast distance, our souls may meet and safely
harbor together! and yet, why should I be so cruel
to my self, to whom thou vvast so unkinde as
not to leave me some few commands before thy
death! this Picture which is thy lively
representation, is more courteous, 'twill not deny me
twenty thousand kisses, since the fates deny me
thee, it shall be my husband, for here I vow
never to marry other! [$At those words I stepped
to her, and snatching away the Picture, would
have departed with it, had not she, taking hold
of my cloaths, stopped me, and falling down on

deprive me not of that Jewel which I prize
above the wealth of both the (^Indies^) , rather let
me beg you to possess your self of all I have,
and leave me onely that. You beg in vain, [$said I,$]
nor must you think that bribes vvill make me so
much wrong my friend as to leave his will
unperformed. What was that friend, [$said she?$]
'Twas one, [$said I,$] loved you too well, nor did
deserve such inconstancy as you have been guilty
of, which made him charge and command me
when his soul was now ready to expire to come
hither, and force from thee this Picture, unfit
to grace a Strumpets chamber. Suspend not my
fear Sir, [$replied she,$] but let me know the name
of this cruel friend of yours. (^Spencer^) , [$said I.$]
Villain, [$said she, starting up,$] thou liest, and so
much more damned is thy lie, by how much
thou wrongest by it the dead soul of him, who
whilest living, would have pulled out that
treacherous soul that durst have wronged that
chastity, which I have so intirely preserved for
him, and will for his memory. Nay, [$said I,$] if
you will be angry vent your passions alone,
farewell. Oh! stay, [$cried she,$] and though my
(^Spencer^) could be cruel as to deprive me of what I
prize above my life, the onely remembrance I
had of him, yet be not you so inhumane as to
deny me to take my last farewel of it. I do not
much care, [$said I,$] if I grant your suit, provided
you will promise immediately to return it. As I
am chaste I will, [$replied she, and therewithal
gave her the picture, vvhich having kissed over,
<P 1.2.57>
she began afresh to cry out,$] Oh! thou perfect

(^Aurora^) , and every night when all other humane
Creatures were buried in sleep; and none but
Stars were vvitnesses, poured forth Oraisons to
Heaven, for whose sake I have remained
constant and unspotted, though he hath been so
unkinde with his last words to blast my memory,
accept yet this, and this kiss for my last farewel!
and here Sir, [$said she,$] since it must be so, take
this remembrance of my Lord, the sight of
vvhich hath often made me give alms, visit
prisoners, and lend money to needy Travellers,
that Heaven might repay it (^Spencer^) , but with it
let me beg one boon, that if some few days
hence you hear I am expired, you will for his
sake, to whom you were once a friend,
accompany my corps to the grave. [$I was so extreamly
transported vvith this excess of vertue, (for

Oh! now you have told me that, [$replied she,$]

his love was more superlative. But I hope
Captain (^Goodlake^) , [$continued she,$] you will excuse
me for my being so rash with you, 'twas your

disguise caused it. I must rather beg excuse,
[$replied I,$] that I have been so harsh to you, though
I doubt not your pardon; since, [$said I,$] 'tis now
in vain to lament (^Spencers^) death, and that he
hath divided his Estate betwixt us, let those
loves which we severally ought to him, be
joyned together in us. Alas! Sir, [$replied she,$] my

in it self; but those you have slain in the
conflict, makes it exceed all bounds of Pardon;
For death, [$answered the Gallant (^Spencer^) ,$] it
does not at all trouble me; but I have some
private thoughts torment me, more then ten
thousand tortures could; [$and herewith this
brave Soul fetching a sigh, could not restrain
some tears, which the thoughts of his beloved
Spouse made gush out. When the noble (^Bassa^)
seeing his discomposure, commanded the Guard
to depart, and leave the Prisoner alone with
him.$]
   [$The Guard readily obeyed the command of
their General, when he taking opportunity
from the Solitude addressed himself to his
Prisoner in these generous terms;$] Sir, [$ (said he) $]
though I am a Moor, a Nation strange to you
<P 2.1.122>
Christians; yet, think that I can be noble; but
in you I have observed such strange
contrarieties, that I cannot tell well how to reconcile
them; for when I consider your mighty actions
and late greatness of your Spirit, when my men
flew before you like dust before the wind, I
cannot but admire at your present passion, and
justly wonder why such a small effuse of blood,
let out by these sleight wounds, or the pale-fear
of grisly death should draw a tear for such a
Noble eye; Thou most worthy of thy Nation
[$ (replyed (^Spencer^) ) $] do not so much mistake me,
to think that wounds, blood, death, or all tortures
imaginable, could force one drop from hence;
but that I now suffer under, as far exceeds all
torments that ever the wicked art, or wit of
Man invented, as Hell doth Heaven in pains.
This it is, that like the burning Sun extracts
from my declining Soul, this dewy and
effeminate moisture: Sir, [$ (answered the (^Bassa^) ) $] if I
have yet gained in you an opinion, that I dare
be noble, impart to me your sorrow's, and if
any thing in my power can assist you, though it
be with the hazard of my life, rest assured I will
perform it. Your Nobleness most Illustrious
(^Bassa^) [$ (answered (^Spencer^) ) $] obliges me to relate
my misfortune, though I must despair of
remedy; yet if you have a heart not wholly
composed of Adamant, it must needs melt it, to
consider my misery; and think then Sir, if you
have ever loved, or if ever you loved one so fair,
so constant, so chast, as my dear Spouse;
whether it would not confound you, and make
<P 2.1.123>
whole Oceans of tears flow from your eyes, to
know that for your sake she was betrayed to a
black and remediless-fate? I confess 
[$ (answered the (^Bassa^) ) $] 't would perplex a well-biassed
Soul; but how can this be your condition? were
nor all your joy's but lately consummate, by
uniting your Souls, according to your own
manner of marriage, and were you not but
yesterday both honoured in the highest degree,
by the vertuous (^Mullisheg^) ? 'Tis  true, worthy
(^Bassa^) , [$ (replyed (^Spencer^) ) $] he honoured us at first
too much, but at length his lust outway'd his
honour, and as if his Soul had been of a darker
Eye then his Face; he sought to take away
that he had given me, and rob me of that
Jewel I prize far above my Life; but the fates
were yet happy unto me, in that I found means 
this night to convey my beauteous Spouse, the
Captain, and Lieutenant, and others aboard
Ship, and now my self intended to follow them,
but missing my way fell amongst your Guard,
where wonder not that I performed wonders,
and durst single oppose my self against your
multitudes; for it was the impression she had
left upon my heart, made me act things
beyond a man. But Sir, [$ (replyed (^Ioffer^) ) $] since
she is safe aboard, recal your noble spirits, and
let not your own fates thus distract you. Ah!
generous Sir, [$ (said (^Spencer^) ) $] the sting of all is
yet behind, I at her parting from me, swore by
the honour of a Gentleman, and by all the
vow's and loves had ever past between us, that
if I survived, I would visit her aboard before 
<P 2.1.124>
the morning Star appeared, which she seconded
with a solemn vow, that if I did not she should
certainly esteem me dead, and not Heaven it
self should hinder her from following me to the
Grave, This Great (^Bassa^) is it; Fear of her
safety not my own, that drew these tears from a
Souldiers eyes. [$'Twas strange what noble pitty
this relation bred in the heart of the thrice
worthy (^Moor^) :$] Noble Sir, [$said he,$] you have
indeed told me story would move the very
Rocks to pitty, and that I may let you know,
all moral virtues are not wholly and only seated
in the hearts of (^Christians^) ; Go freely, pass to
your Love and preserve her Life, I will not
desire you to return, but if you do not remember,
this Head of mine goes in exchange for yours,
which I cannot lay down in a better service.
[$My worthy Lord was so startled at this high
generosity of the (^Moors^) , that he knew not what
answer to return, nor indeed how to accept his
so obliging proffer; but at length considering it
would be the preservation of his dearest Spouse,
he resolved not to refuse the Courtesy, but
withall desiring the (^Bassa^) to oblige him by
some solemn Oath, to return at an appointed
hour:$] No, [$ (replyed (^Ioffer^) ) $] it will be sufficient,
if you give me your word to return by that
time to morrow, that the Sun shall be mounted
to the Meridian: Let God's and Men
[$ (answered (^Spencer^) ) $] conspire to make me
miserable if I fail one Minute; Let me then conduct
you, [$said the (^Bassa^) ,$] past all watches, [$and
therewithal himself in Person brought him to the
<P 2.1.125>
place where the Boat did attend him, who
received him with an inexpressible joy.$]
[^WHEN SPENCER COMES ABOARD THE SHIP BESS IS HAPPY TO SEE HIM.^]
<P 2.1.126>
[^...^] Alas! my dear
Soul, now I have seen thee, I must again leave
thee: [$These Words were like a Thunderbolt,
which almost before their noise was heard,
bereft my dear Lady of her senses, who fell
entranced at the feet of her beloved Spouse, but
our art and care soon recovered her, at which
she seemed somewhat displeased, crying out:$]
Wherefore do you in vain endeavour to ruin me,
for if that Tongue that gave the wound do not
again give present cure, not all (^Esculapius^) his
art can reprieve me from death. Alas! my
dear Love [$ (said (^Spencer^) ) $] arm your self with
patience since I must depart, and endeavour
not to make me forfeit by our passion, my own
and my Countries honour, the Faith and
Reputation of a Christian all which are pawn'd for
my return. What will the (^Moors^) say? and
how justly may they say, That we that are
(^Christians^) make great boast of Faith, but
they alone do honourable good and vertuous
works.
[^SPENCER EXPLAINS THE SITUATION TO HIS FRIENDS; BESS SPEAKS:^]
<P 2.1.127>
Oh Sir! do you now then prize my love no
better, then to rate it beneath the friendship
of a Barbarous Moor, or can you to save him,
betray and leave me to an assured death? Can
you thus reward the Pains and Travels I have
undergone for your sake; Alas! [$ (said the
<P 2.1.128>
generous (^Spencer^) ) $] do not thus torment me, I
must and will praise my Honour, and the Faith,
and Reputation of a Christian, above whatever
the Earth can yield: Shall (^Fesse^) report
hereafter, to the shame and disgrace of Ours, and
all other Countries of Christendom, to the
scandal and ignominy of our Faith and
Religion, that a barbarous Moor should exceed us in
Nobleness and Gallantry, No! I will first ten
thousand times Sacrifice this Life, rather then
make so great a forfeit. [$In summe, when
nothing could prevail to procure his stay, we
were inforced with patience to suffer his
departure.$]
[^KING MULLISHEG BECOMES AWARE THAT NEITHER SPENCER 
NOR BESS ARE IN HIS PALACE.^]
<P 2.1.130>
[^---^] 'Tis
most true, [$Answered the King,$] and thou
Trayterous Villain [$ (said he, turning to
(^Alcade Beigh^) ) $] that hast been a Sharer and
Conspirer with these English to rob us of our
Jewells and Treasure, shalt as sure as we are King
of (^Fesse^) and (^Morrocco^) pay the forfeit of thy
Treacherous Head. Alas! Dread Soveraign,
[$ (answered the (^Beigh^) ) $] 'twas willingness to
do you Service, which made me commit this
Error: Villain, [$said (^Mullisheg^) ,$] thou lyest;
't was bribes; therefore dispute no more,
but let our Guard load him with Irons, [$and
turning to the Messenger,$] but is (^Spencer^) then
escaped, [$said he?$] No dread King [$ (said he) $]
for though at the Bridge with his Gyant-like
blow's, he sent several of your Majesties
Subjects to their graves; yet when by a loud
Alarm we called the whole Watch to our
assistance, he was forced to yield to our
Numbers, and is at present Prisoner to the Great
(^Ioffer Bassa^) . 'Tis well then, [$answered the
King,$] for upon him will we revenge all our
injuries, go [$said he to his attending Guard,$]
command our (^Bassa^) to bring him, overpressed with
Irons to our Royal Presence.
[^BASSA GOES TO MULLISHEG.^]
<P 2.1.131>
Mighty King, [$answered the (^Bassa^) ,$] had
you with me beheld his unparrarel'd
Prowess, and withal seen his passions,
you would like me pitty these disasters,
wherein his unhappy Stars have
<P 2.1.132>
involved him, Insolent Villain [$ (replyed
(^Mullisheg^) ) $] presumest thou to prescribe us
Rules, we will know no pitty for an
injury of so high a Nature, and more then
our revenge we have vow'd his death;
therefore go fetch him forth. Let me
at least [$ (replied the (^Bassa^) ) $] for all the
services I have done you, beg of your
Majesty to spare him but some few
hours; still darest thou [$ (said the King) $]
Capitulate with us, we tell thee once
more that the least delay is death; Then
know mighty Prince [$ (said (^Ioffer^) ) $] That
he was my Prisoner, and is so still by
promise, for I presuming that such
Noble vallour could not be lodged alone
without those other virtues; Faith and
Honour gave him free liberty to go to
his Ship, only upon his promise to return
before the Sun felt any declension
towards the West; Nor do I yet doubt,
but your Majesty will find that
Nobleness in him which I have presumed.
Foolish (^Bassa^) , [$said the King,$] thus to
jeast away thy own Life, but jest thou
didst not, you are all Conspirators
against me, and by Mahomet shall all
<P 2.1.133>
receive the rewards of your Treachery;
Could'st thou think that a Stranger so
remote both in Country and Religion,
being imbarqued at Sea free from our 
hands, and in the embraces of his sweet
and lovely Bride, His Captain and
Sailors all aboard, and fortune it self
supplying him with a fair and prosperous
Gale, would expose all these to
voluntary dangers, and himself to a certain
death, only for a verbal promise? At
least let your Majesty [$ (replied the (^Bassa^) ) $]
grant me Life but till the hour be past,
and if he comes not, I shall willingly
embrace death, and glory that though a
(^Moor^) , I have excceded a (^Christian^) in
Nobleness. No fond Fool [$ (replyed
the (^Moorish^) King) $] thou shalt not live a
Minute, [$and therewith gave present
order to his Guard to see him put to
Death.$]
[^SPENCER ARRIVES AND BASSA IS RESCUED: MULLISHEG ACCUSES 
SPENCER OF SEVERAL CRIMES.^]
<P 2.1.135>
[^---^] I confess [$ (replied
(^Spencer^) , with an undaunted courage) $] that
I have done all thou chargest me with,
save only the stealing thy Treasure,
which though I could not do, because
thou gavest it; yet finding thee unworthy
in thy intentions towards us, I scorn'd
to take with me that which would have
been the price of my dishonour, &
therefore of all thy Gold and Jewels would
not permit one dram to be unbarqued; as
for that Death thou threatnest, know
proud (^Mullisheg^) , I am glad I owe thee
nothing, but what I have in my ability to
pay, if my Life be forfeit in taking it,
thou takest nothing but what I came
purposely hither to tender. Art thou so
resolute [$ (answered (^Mullisheg^) ) $] however out
of pitty to thee, we will yet propose thee
one way to save thy Life, nor any other
<P 2.1.136>
way hast thou to effect it, send then to thy
Ship and surrender up to me the Captain
and thy fair Spouse, or otherwise by all
the Rights of our Holy Prophet thou
shalt not live an hour. Dishonourable
Tyrant [$ (replied (^Spencer^) ) $] know that I so
much despise both thee and thy
Tyranny, that were there on one side all the
Tortures that either Turks or Devils
ever invented, threatned to be inflicted
on me; and on the other side, wert thou
Commander over all the Kingdoms of
the Earth, and should lay at my Feet all
their Crowns and Scepters, and make me
Monarch of the whole Universe; rather
then yield up the basest of my
Ship-Boyes to become thy slave, much less
betray my Spouse to thee and to thy
bruitish lust, I would endure ten thousand
Deaths; and so thou shalt [$ (cried
(^Mullisheg^) ) $] prepare to torture him.
   [$At that Word my Lady (attended
by the Captain, Lieutenant (^Forcet^) , and
my self, who never had forsaken her) 
having followed her beloved (^Spencer^) , with
a full resolution to die with him, or for

<P 2.1.137>
down on her knees before the (^Moorish^)
King;$] Behold cruel (^Mullisheg^) , [$said she,$] if
thou dost delight in blood, but spare that
of my beloved (^Spencer^) ; and in it's stead
I here present thee mine, and those of all 
my Train, to make a flood instead of his
small Rivulet: [$The generous (^Spencer^) was
extreamly distracted at our suddain
appearance, and turning to us,$] all you have
wronged me [$ (said he) $] above injury, and
how sufficiently to express my just anger,
I know not, for in you I die ten thousand
Deaths, that could otherwise have tasted
but one; [$and then turning to the (^Moor^) :$]
Mighty King, [$said he,$] show yourself at
least to have somewhat of humanity, by
dismissing these to their Ship, and since
my Life is only forfeit, take but that,
and at my Death, I shall proclaim you
merciful. Oh! no great King [$said my
Magnamous Lady,) $] It were injustice &
not mercy to take his Life, and spare
mine, since what he did was only for my
sake and safety; or if he have committed
any fault [$ (said we altogether) $] let all our
lives serve as so many victimes to expiate
his Crime, and appease your anger.
<P 2.1.138>
Alas! you need not plead for death,
[$ (replied (^Mullisheg^) ) $] you shall all assuredly
die, but especially you treacherous
Captain, on whom I will execute such a
revenge as shall make future generations
to read it: I came not hither great King
[$ (said (^Goodlake^) ) $] to be daunted with your
threats, but freely to offer my Life (who
am only guilty) to redeem my friends,
take then this Body and tear it in pieces
with the most exquisite Tortures that the
Savagest (^Barbarians^) did ever invent? and
spare but the rest, I shall endure them
contentedly. Thou shalt not doubt it,
[$replied the (^Moor^) ;$] but villain [$said he,$] what
infamous Strumpet was it that thou
betrayedst to our Royal Bed. For that
Mighty King [$ (said the Queen, who as
well by the several Circumstances, as by
(^Ruffmans^) Information was confirmed, she
that night enjoyed the King) $]  I must with
your pardon excuse him; for having had
private advice of your designs, I wrought
him to my purpose; nor was it any other
then my self whom you last night
embraced.
[^KING MULLISHEG REGRETS HIS ACTIONS AND SPEAKS:^]
<P 2.1.139>

prevalency over me? or shall all those
virtuous deeds, for which I have been so
long renowned in (^Fesse^) be utterly exiled,
shall the Christians still have the honour
to be sole heirs to goodness, and we
(^Moors^) barbarous and bloody. No [$ (said
