they dyd make a hedge (round in
compas,) and they had got a 
Cocow, and put her in it and sayde,$]
singe here all the yeare, and thou
shalte lacke neyther meate nor
drincke. [$The Cocow as soone as
shee was set wyth in the hedge,
flew her waye.$] A vengeaunce on
her [$sayde they,$] we made not our
hedge high ynough.

[}THE IIII. TALE.}]

   [$There was a man of Gotam 
the which went to the 
market to Nottingham to sell cheese.
And as hee was goynge downe
the hyll to Nottingham brydge,
one of hys cheeses dyd fall out of
<P A4V>
hys poake, and did runne downe

dyd trundle them downe the hyll
one after another: and some ran
into one busshe, and some into
another. And at the laste he sayde$]
I charge you all meete me in the
market place. [$When the fellowe

he said$] a vengeaunce on them al.
I dyd feare to see that my
cheeses dyd runne so faste, that they
runne beyonde the market: I am
sure that they be almoste now at
Yorke. [$He hyred [^SOURCE TEXT: byred^] a horse to ryde
after to Yorke to seeke hys 
cheeses wheare they weare not. But
to thys daye, no man coulde tell
hym of hys cheeses.$]

He beyng angrye sayde,$] art thou
worthy to keepe a Forge, to haue
men stunge here wythe Waspes?
O neyghboure [$sayde the smythe,$]

Gotam dyd caste theyr
heads together what they shuld
doe with theyr whyte hearyng,
and theyr red hearyng, and their
sprottes, and salt fyshe, One

[}THE VIII. TALE.}]

   [$On a time the men of Gotam

[}THE IX. TALE.}]

   [$On a tyme theare was one of

dyd twelue of vs come oute. [$And
they tolde themselues, and 
euerye man dyd tell a leuen, and the

<P B1V>
[$They went backe to the brooke
whear that they had ben fishing

& she hauinge a fayre heare,

he would cut it of, & he durste not
doe it when she was waking, but
when she was a sleape. So on a 
night he toke vp a paire of sheres
and layde them vnder hys beads
head, the whyche the wyfe 
perceyued. And then shee dyd call to
her one of her maydes and sayde,$]

<P B3R>

into the hall & burnte the heare.
This man had a horse the which
hee dyd loue aboue all thynges.
The wyfe went into the stable, &

layd it vnder hir husba~ds heade.
In the mornynge shee dyd ryse be

sheres wrapt in hys horse taile, &
did com to his wife saying,$] I cry
the merci for I had thought that
I had cut of thy heare to night, &
I haue cut of my horse tayle. Ye
[$sayd she$] selfe do selfe haue, manye
a man thinketh to do another ma~
a shrewde turne, and turnethe
oft tymes to his owne selfe.

[}THE .XIII. TALE.}]

   [$There was a man in Gotam
that layde a wager wythe

A bustard [$said they?$] it is an olde

The wife prayed hir husband (or

fethers. The man takynge hys

gentlemens seruauntes and sayde,$] I
pray you be not angrye wyth mee
for you shall see here that I had a 
bustard, for here be the fethers: [$&

mens seruants seing the goose 
fethers sayde,$] why knaue couldest

head of wod that was bare and
sayd,$] syr here is youre bare head.
I say [$sayde the skotyshman,$] the
mokyl deuill, is this a bare head?
Ye [$said the caruer.$] I say [$sayd the
Skotishman,$] I will haue a bare

whet herso~, kenst thou not a sew
that wil greet & grone, & her 
gryces wil run after her & cry a weke

pigge. Yea [$said the skotish ma~,$] let

in timber, & mek me a bird & set
it on his skalps, and cause her to
sing whip whir, whip whir. [$The
caruer sayde,$] I can not cause her

[}THE XIX. TALE.}]

   [$In old time whe~ as these afore
said Iestes was (as me~ of that
<P C1V>
cuntrey reporteth) that such
fantasticall matters weare done at
gotam (the which I can not tell
halfe.) The wyues weare 
gathered together in an alehouse  And
the one sayde to the other y=t= they
weare all profitable to their
husbandes.$] Whyche waye good
gossips [$sayd the Alewife. The fyrste
sayd,$] I shall tell you all good 
gossips: I can neither bake nor brew
nor I can doe no worke, 
whearefore I do make euery day holiday
& I go to the alehouse, bicause at
all times I ca~not go to y=e= church,
& in the alehouse I praye to God
to speede well my husband. And
I do think my praier shal do him
much more good then my labour
if I could worke. [$Then sayde the
second,$] I am profitable to my
husba~d in sauing of ca~dels in winter
<P C2R>
for I do cause my husband and al
my house folkes to go to bead by
daylighte, & to rise by daylight.
[$The thyrd wife sayd,$] & I am
profytable to my husbande in
spending of bread, for I will eate but 
litle, for to the drinckyng of a
galon or two of good ale, I care for
no meate. [$The fourth wife saide,$]
I am loth to spend meat & drinke
at home in my owne house, wher
fore I do go to the wine tauerne
at Nottingham, & do take wine,
and such things as god shal send
me theare. [$The fifte wyfe sayd$] a
man shall euer haue more
companye in another mans house then
his owne, (& most co~monlye in an
Alehouse is the best cheare in a
towne.) And for sparing of meate
& drynke and other necessaryes,
I do go to the alehouse. [$The sixt
<P C2V>
wife said,$] my husband hath woll,
and flax and tow: and to spare it,
I go to other mens houses to do
other mens worke. [$The seuenth
wife said,$] I do spare my husba~ds
wood & cole, and do sit talking al
the day by other mens fires. [$The
eight said,$] beefe, mutton, & porcke
is dere, wherfore I doe spare it, &
do take pigge, goose, hen, chicken
conye and capon, the which be of
lower pryce. [$The ninth said,$] & I
do spare my husbands sope & lye, 
for when hee shoulde be wasshed
once in a weeke, I doe wash once
in a quarter of a yeer. [$Then sayd
the alewife,$] and I doe keepe my
husbandes ale (that I do brew,)
from sowryng. For wheare as I
was want to drynke vp all, nowe
I do leaue neuer a drop.
<P C3R>
[}THE .XX. TALE.}]

   [$On Ashwednesday the priest
of gotam wold make a 
colacion to his parishoners and said,$]
freyndes the tyme is come that
you must vse praier and fasting, &
almes dedes, and this weke cum
you to shryfte, and I wyll tel you
more of my mynd, for as for
prayers, I thinke theare bee not
two persons in the parish can say
halfe their Pater noster. As for
fasting, you fast styll: for you haue
not a good meales meat through
the whole yeare. As for almes
dedes, what shuld you do to giue
any thyng, that hath nothing to
take to. But when that you doe
come to shrift, I will tel you more
of my mynd. [$After masse, y=e= good
man that did keepe the alehouse,
did come to shrift, & aboue al 
thinges hee confessed hymselfe to bee
<P C3V>
drunck diuers times in the yeere,
specially in Lent. The priest sayd$]
in Lent thou shouldest moste
refraine from dru~kenes, & abstaine
fro~ drinke. Not so [$said the fellow,$]
for it is an old prouerbe that fishe
must swim. Ye [$sayd the prieste,$] it
must swim in water. I crye God
mercy [$sayd the fellow,$] I thought
it shuld haue swom in good ale.

[}THE XXI. TALE.}]

   [$So one after another the men
of Gotam did come to shrift, &
whan they were shryue~ the priest
said$] I cannot tell what penau~ce
to geue you. If I should enioyne
you to prayer, there is non of you
that can say your Pater noster, &
you be now to old to learne. And
to enioyne [^SOURCE TEXT: enioye^] you to fast, it weare but
folyshnes, for you doe not eate a
good meales meate in a yeare.
<P C4R>
Wherfore I do inioyne the to 
labour wel the weeke, y=t= thou maist
fare wel [^SOURCE TEXT: farewel^] to diner on the sondaies:
and I wil come to dinner [^SOURCE TEXT: dnner^] and see
that it be so, and take part. 
[$Another man hee dyd enioyne to fare
well the monday. And another
the tuesday. And so one after
another, that one or other shoulde
fare well once a weeke, that hee
myght haue parte of the meate.
And as for almes deedes, y=e= priest
sayd,$] you be but beggers all,
excepte it be one or two,
therfore bestowe the
almes on youre
owne selues.
