[^HAVING FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE LOCAL SMITH'S WIFE, THE 
PRIOR OF CANTERBURY ARRANGES FOR THE SMITH TO BECOME THE 
FARRIER FOR HIS PRIORY, SO THAT SHE IS CLOSE BY.^]
[^---^] [$At this the
Smith was very glad:$] Nay more [$quoth the Prior$]
because thou shall haue more gaines out of the Dorter,
seeing thy wife is a good clenly woman, shee shal be
Landresse for mee, and the whole Couent. [$The Smith
hearing this, perceiued by the weathercocke which way the 
wind blew, shakt the head and began to smile: The
<P 5>
Prior demannded of him why he laught:$] marry syr [$quoth
he,$] seeing we are at meate, and mirth is good for
digestion, I will tell you a merry Jest. There was such a poore
man as my selfe that dwelt as I doe hard by a Priory,
and he had brought vp in his house a litle Lambe, which
growing to a sheepe woulde wander all abroade and
returne home safe at night without any hurt; at last this
litle sheepe beeing the poore mans treasure, seeing the
Priory gate open and the yarde full of grasse went in
and fedde there: The wanton Fryars that were idle,
would oft sport with the Lambe and play withall, and
pulled off the wooll of the backe, that it had almost left
nothing but the bare pelt: which the poore man espying
kept vp his sheep and would not suffer it to go any more
abroad: yet it had gotten such a sweet sauour in the 
Priory yarde, that assoone as it brake loose, it would thither;
where the Prior and the Fryars spying it againe, 
consented and eate it vp all: the good man came to aske for
his sheepe, and they laughing at him gaue him no other
mendes but the hornes: So my Maisters if my wife
should bee your Landresse, I warrant you, if I came to
inquire for hir, I might haue such fees as the poore man
had for his losse: No, no I am well I thanke you, if my
selfe may serue for a Farrier so it is, but my wife (of all
men shall not haue to deale either with Priors or
Fryars. [$At this they all laught, but the Prior not willing to
giue ouer the chase, thus made this answere.$] Why
Smith [$ (quoth he) $] thou art a foole, thou maist haue a 
(^prouiso^) for that, for though shee wash our clothes, yet shee
shall neither fetch them nor bring them home, neither
shall there euer a Fryar come at thy house, onely the
Scull of the kitchin, and I hope thou fearest not him.
No [$quoth the Smith,$] they bee these breechlesse yeomen
that I stand so much in doubt of: but vpon these
conditions aforesaide, that shee shall neither fetch them nor
carry them home, shee shalbe you Landresse, [$vpon this
<P 6>
they agreed, and the Smith went to his house and tolde
his wife all. Shee that was a wily wench thought with
hir selfe that whatsoeuer hir husband fisht for he would
catch a frog; and that dealt hee neuer so warily, yet shee
woulde make him one of the head men of the parish as
well as his neighbours. Shee coniecturing thus with hir
selfe, the next morning came the Scull early (by that the
Smith was vp and at his worke) with foule clothes,$] God
speede syr [$quoth he.$] I haue brought your wife the Priors
linnen; ah welcome good fellow [$quoth he,$] goe thy waies
vp the Chamber to my wife, shee is aboue, and I thinke a
bed: [$the Scul trotted vp the staires & saluted the woman:$]
Mistres [$quoth he,$] the Prior hath sent you his cloathes &
praies you they may bee done on wednesday next: they
shall be done [$quoth shee$] with all speede: and [$quoth the
Scull,$] his worship wild me in secrete to giue you a Ring
for a token, and to desire you to thinke that he loues you
as heartily as any woman in the worlde: [$the poore
woman seeing a gold Ring, and hauing neuer had any
before in hir life, helde hir selfe a proude woman, and 
bethought her what good gifts shee should daily haue if shee
had such a louer as the Prior: wherefore shee returned
him this answere by the Scull, y=t= shee had euer thought
well of him, but hir husband was a iealous foole & watcht
hir narrowly wheresoeuer shee went, but as far as shee
might, shee was his at command. Home went the Scul,
and the Prior was risen by that hee returned, and askt
him$] what newes: what newes [$quoth the Scull,$] marry
thus syr, assoone as I came to the doore I founde the
Smith hard at his worke, and I saluted him by the time
of the day, and asked him where his wife was, saying, I
had brought the Priors linnen. Goe vp the staires, good
fellow quoth he, for I thinke my wife is in bed, and Syr
there indeede I found hir, and truely Syr if you will
beleeue me, me thought shee lay too louely in hir bed to lie
with a Smith, so syr I gaue hir your token and tolde hir
<P 7>
what you bad me: and she made answere that your 
worship was the man whom shee had euer thought well of,
but hir husband was a iealous foole, yet as farre as shee
could shee was at his commaund. [$This satisfied the
Priors expectation, and on wednesday morning when the
Scull shoulde goe for his cleane linnen, the Prior
compounded with him and gaue him a brase of Angels to
keepe his counsaile: saying,$] (^Tom^) [$ (for so was the Sculs
name) $] thou knowest al flesh is fraile, and we are men as
well as others, though our profession be more holy,
therfore (^Tom^) so it is, y=t= I haue loued the Smiths wife a long
time, & now may I haue opportunity to fill my desires, I
wil this morning take thy clothes on, & besmeere my face
and with the basket hie for the cleane clothes, onely I
care for nothing if thou keepe my counsaile. Feare not
that syr, [$quoth the Scull,$] but I will bee so secrete as you
can desire: [$with that the Prior was briefe for because he
longd to be there, and on with the Sculs rags, and
taking his basket on his necke, hied him very orderly
to the Smiths house by that time day did appeare, where
he found him hard at worke:$] God morrow syr [$quoth the
Prior,$] I am come for the linnen, goe vp the staires
fellow [$quoth the Smith,$] thou commest very early, my wife
is yet in bed. [$Vp trudgd the Prior, and there he founde
his Paramour in a sweete sleepe, the Prior stept to hir
and kist hir, and with that shee wakte, and seeing the
Scull,$] why how now syr sauce, [$quoth shee,$] can you not
speake before you come vp? my husband is a wise man to
send such companions vp into the Chamber where I am
in bedde, twere no matter and the match were equall,
to make him weare the horne for it. Oh bee
content good loue [$quoth the Prior,$] for knowe I am not
(^Tom^) the Scull, but the Prior himselfe that sent thee the
Ring, who for thy sake is come thus disguised: [^---^]
[^THE PRIOR REVEALED HIS TRUE IDENTITY, AND THEY MADE LOVE. 
THEREAFTER, TWICE WEEKLY, THE PRIOR WOULD COME TO HER 
DISGUISED AS TOM. ON ONE PARTICULAR MORNING, HOWEVER, WHEN
THE PRIOR WAS TOO ILL TO VISIT, THE REAL TOM CAME TO 
COLLECT THE LINEN.^]
<P 8>
[^---^] Nowe
Smith [$quoth he$] good morrow, is thy wife vp. No [$quoth
the Smith$] but shee is awake, goe vp and carry your 
linnen a Gods name: [^---^]
[^THE SCULL RUSHES TO THE BEDROOM, AND SEEING IT IN 
DARKNESS, SLIPS INTO BED WITH THE SMITH'S WIFE, WHO 
MISTAKES HIM FOR THE PRIOR. HOWEVER, SHE IS SURPRISED 
WHEN HE LEAVES WITHOUT SAYING A WORD, AND ASKS THE PRIOR 
TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF, THE NEXT DAY.^]
I pray you tell me maister Prior [$quoth shee,$] what meant
you yesterday morning that you came so quiet, and slipt
away with such silence after you got out of bed: [$by this
the Prior perceiued that the Scull had cut a shiue on his
loaf, and so thought to dissemble the matter.$] Faith sweet
heart [$quoth he,$] I heard a noise, and thought it had beene
thy husband that had come vp so I coniectured [$quoth
<P 9>
the Smiths wife,$] and therefore after you were gone,
seeing you were freighted with your owne shadowe I
laught hartily: [$thus as long as they durst they chatted, 
but at last the Prior vp with his basket and away.$]
[^ON RETURNING HOME, THE PRIOR QUESTIONED THE SCULL, WHO
CONFESSED. AFTER MAKING HIM SWEAR AN OATH NEVER TO REPEAT
HIS BEHAVIOUR, HE BEAT HIM. THE SCULL, DESIRING
REVENGE, SOUGHT OUT THE SMITH, AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THE 
PRIOR'S VISITS TO HIS WIFE.^] 
[^---^] [$at this
the Smith fetcht a great sigh;$] alas [$quoth he,$] and am I a
Cuckolde? why not you [$quoth the Scul,$] as well as your
betters? Indeede [$quoth the Smith,$] that is all the
comfort that I haue, that my betters haue had as hard hap:
for the Abbot of saint (^Peters^) that is an holy man, had
but one Lemman, and yet shee was not content with
twenty morsels: and I am a poore Smith & a lay man,
no maruaile then if my fortune be as forked as the rest:
but by the holy Roode of Rochester [$quoth he,$] I will bee
so reuengd on the Prior, that after I haue taken him, he
shall hate Lechery the worse while he liues. I but [$quoth
the Scul,$] take heede thou plagust not me in steede of the
Prior. To auoid therefore all insuing danger, if I come
to morrow thou shalt knowe mee by this token, I will
aske thee whether thou hast drunke this morning or no:
<P 10>
if thou hearest no such watchword, then knowe it is the
Prior. So bee it [$quoth the Smith, and vpon this they 
drunke their drinke and departed. The next morning
the Smith was early at his worke, and the Prior that
longde to be with his Lemmon was assoone awake, and
vp hee got, and on with the Sculs apparrell, and to the
Smiths house, and after his accustomed maner bad him
good morrow and vp the staires. The Smith perceiuing
it was the Prior, because hee wanted his watchworde,
hied vp presently after him, and tooke the Prior in bed
with his wife:$] why how nowe Scull [$quoth hee?$] will no
worse meate go downe with you then my wife? Before
you and I part, I will learne you howe you make
(^Vulcan^) of mee without you were more like (^Mars^) then you
be. [^...^]
[^THE SMITH AND HIS MAN DRAGGED THE PRIOR OUT OF THE BED, 
THRUST HIM INTO A SACK, AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE STREET, 
WHEREUPON THE SMITH MADE HIS WIFE FLAIL THE SACK. WHEN
HER STROKES WERE TOO GENTLE, HE WHIPPED HER.^]
[^---^] [$the 
people that came by maruailed at this Antick, and askt the
Smith, what he was a doing?$] killing of fleas [$quoth the
Smith,$] that I found this morning in my bedde, and
because my wife is so idle and will not strike home, I
stand with my whip to whet hir on. Neighbours 
therefore giue good eare, and marke the end, and see when my
wife hath beaten them enough what foul fleas they be,
and by my example learne whensoeuer you take such
great fleas in your wiues bedde, to put them to the like
punishment. [$The people flocked together to see this
sport, and although the Prior was almost bruised to
death (though for fauouring of him the Smiths wife
<P 11>
bore many a lash) yet he durst not cry for feare of further
discredit, but lay still and suffered all with patience. At
last a multitude of people flocking together, it chaunced
that vppon serious businesse the Abbot of saint (^Peters^)
came by, who seeing such a throng, sent one of his men to
knowe what the matter meant.$] Oh may it please your
Lordship [$quoth the Smith,$] such a sight as you neuer
saw! wherfore for Christs sake I aske it, that you would
take so much paines as to come ouer the way and see:
[$the Abbot stept ouer the Channell, and when hee came
and saw the Smiths wife with hir flaile, and him with
his whip, he wondred, & the Smith told him as the rest,
that it was a flea that he tooke in his wiues bed: all this
while lay the Prior with a heauy heart, for feare the
Smith shoulde shake him out of the sacke: wishing to
abide twise as much torment, so hee might escape 
vnknowne. As the Abbot about this matter stoode 
questioning with the Smith, the Scull that mist the Prior that
past his howre, thought the Smith had plaid some mad
prancke with him, went and put on the Priors 
apparrell, and his Coole ouer his heade that hee might not be
knowen, and went downe to the Smiths house ward,
where seeing a concourse of people hee hasted him
thither. At last the Smith spied him and cryed,$] Oh my
Lord Abbot yonder comes the Prior of saint (^Austins^) , it 
was one of his fleas. [$Wel knew the Smith it was (^Tom^)
Scull, but his wife supposing it to be the Prior, and that
he in the sacke was the Scul that had deceiued hir, in
despight for reuenge laid on such blows, that shee needed no
whipping to mend hir strokes. When the Prior came,
& after most humble maner had saluted the Abbot, he
desired to knowe the cause of this strange sight:$] marry
[$quoth the smith,$] Maister Prior, I may thanke you for
this, for a flea of your Priory hath leapt from the
Dorter to my wiues bed, and finding it there this morning,
I put it in a sacke and caused my wife to thresh it, and for
<P 12>
that both you & Master Abbot, & al my neighbors shall see
what parlous fleas oft happen into womens beds; I will
shake him out before you all, [$& with that he vnbound the
sacke, and he threwe out the Prior, who beeing in the
sculs apparrell, was so besmiered and so bloudy, that he
could not be knowen:$] Looke here Maister Prior [$quoth
the smith,$] here is the scull of your Priory. Oh notable
knaue knaue [$quoth (^Tom^) scull,$] so to discredit our house,
what thinke you of this my Lorde Abbot? is this a
sufficient punishment or no, considering by this fault he
shal giue occasion of slaunder to the whole Priory? He is
[$quoth the Abbot,$] within the iurisdiction of your censure,
and therefore deale with him as you list. Marry [$quoth
the scul then thus:$] because it is an open fault, it shal haue
a more open punishment; for if it be smothered vp thus,
they wil say that I am a fauourer of sinne: [$with that he
cald to certaine of his couent, for most of the Monkes of
the Priory were come thither,$] howe say you brethren
[$quoth he,$] is it not best that he stand all this forenoone on
the Pillory, and haue a paper written on his heade 
containing the whole matter of his offence? and the smiths
wife shall stand vnder him with hir flaile, and the smith
with his whip: and so [$quoth the smith$] shall all
(^Caunterburie^) laugh at me that come into the market place to
proue my selfe a Cuckolde. No goodman scull [$quoth he,$] it
shal not be so, [$and with that he puld of his Coole and said,$]
Masters and neighbours, see here is the scul of the house,
and this beaten in the sacke is the Prior himselfe that
came to my wife in the sculs apparrell: [$at this all the
people clapt their hands, laught & made good game, to see
howe simply the Prior stood and in what a maiestrie the
scull was in the Priors abiliments. At the sight the
Abbot abasht, and the Friars were ashamde: but the scull
nothing amased, began afore all the people to say thus:$]
my Maisters [$quoth hee,$] I was once a scholler, though I
am now a scul, and then I learned this old saying in
<P 13>
Latin; (^ (\Caute, si non Caste\) ^) : Liue charily, if not chastly: #
Bee
not so forwarde in your follies that you discouer your
faults to the whole worlde, and especially was this
spoken to men of the Churche, for in that they knowe
much, and doe dehort others from vice, the people looke
their liues and their learning shoulde agree: but when
they offend so grossly as Maister Prior through his ill
example, to bring a whole house in slaunder, then are
they worthy of double punishment: for we know Friars
are men, and I warrant you, there is a great many in
Engla~d haue done as much to others as he hath done to
y=e= smiths wife, & yet haue scapt without discredit: I hope
my Lord Abbot, if you enter into your owne conscience,
you can verifie as much, and therefore seeing hee was so
carelesse of his credit, let him for euer after (to auoid
perpetuall infamie of the house) be banisht out of the 
Priorie. [$To this they agreed, and the people that heard this
collation said, (^Tom^) scull was worthy to be Prior:
wherupon the Abbot and the Fryars consenting, and seeing he
had good learning, turned away the old Prior and made
(^Tom^) scull Prior in his roome: thus was the Prior
punisht for his Lechery, the Smith reuengde for his
Cuckoldry, and the scull for his blowes stumbled on a good
promotion.$]

[^A COBBLER WHO FEARS BEING MADE A CUCKOLD MARRIES LATE IN LIFE. AS 
HE IS A JEALOUS MAN, HE WATCHES HIS BRIDE VERY CLOSELY.^]
[^...^] [$So suspitious and iealous was this Cobler, that
all (^Romney^) talked of his folly: and to vexe him as they
passed by, would say to him;$] ah neighbour good morrow,
now that you haue gotten a faire wife, we hope to haue
you one of the brotherhood, and that the Cuckow in
Aprill may sit and sing in your house as well as with your
poore neighbours. I feare not that [$quoth the Cobler,$] let
hir doo hir woorst, I will giue hir leaue, [$meaning that
he kept such narrow watch ouer hir, as he could neuer
be deceiued, and therefore euery day his wife sitting by
him when he was yerking of his shooes, and she at hir
wheele, then he would chat out this song.$]

[^THE COBBLER'S NEIGHBOUR, AN HANDSOME YOUNG SMITH, ALSO LOVED THE
YOUNG BRIDE. WHEN HE DISCOVERED THAT THE COBBLER WAS AWAY, HE WAITED
UNTIL THE MOTHER WAS SLEEPING AND THEN DIVULGED HIS FEELINGS TO HER.^]
<P 21>
[^---^] [$sundry speeches past betweene the Smith and
the Coblers wife, till at last shee rose, and gaue him hir
ha~d, that shee loued him better then any man in y=e= world,
and woulde if any occasion woulde serue, euer striue to
content him.$] Then sweete heart [$quoth he,$] doe mee but
this fauour, faine to morrow some occasion to go to your
Mothers, and come on the further side of the way fast by
such a doore, and then let mee alone for oportunity to
satisfie both our desires: [$To this shee agreed, and the
Smith went to his Shoppe: presently the olde 
woman wakte, the Cobler came home, and all was
well.$]
   [$At night when they were in bed, taking him about
the necke shee kist him, and tolde him that certaine of hir
friendes met to morrowe at hir Mothers, and that shee
woulde faine goe and see them,$] I pray you good husband
[$quoth shee,$] let your mother and I goe thither, I will not
part out of hir sight, neither will we make any long 
tarriance: [$y=e= husband for shame could not deny this request,
but granted it: whereupon the next morning shee got hir
vp, and on with hir holyday apparrell, and made hir as
fine as fine might bee: the Cobler seeing his wife so
trickt vp in hir cleane Linnen, beganne to bee iealous,
and calde his Mother aside, and charged hir by that loue
shee bare him, not to let his wife part out of hir company
till shee came home againe, which shee promised with an
oath: so away they went, & the Cobler he set him downe
and began to sing.$]
   [$The Smith that all this day was not idle, had
compounded with an olde woman by whose house shee
must passe, to fauour them with house roome, and
reuealed vnto hir all the matter: whose wife it was,
and howe hee woulde haue his purpose brought
<P 22>
to passe:$] by my troth sonne [$quoth she,$] I haue hard much
talke of that iealous Cobler, and I would do my
indeuour to make the Asse were a horne: [$vpon this they
resolued, & she likt well of his policie, & said loue had many
shiftes, at last the Smith spied his mistresse all in her
brauerie, comming with her mother in law: the old wife
was readye, as shee past by the doore, threw a great
bowle full of bloudy water right vpon hir head, that
all her cloathes, and cleane lynnen was marred, 
being so berayde that shee could goe no further:$] alas
mistresse [$quoth the old woman,$] I crie you mercie, what
haue I done? full sore it was against my will: but for
Gods sake come into the house, and shift you with cleane
linnen: if you haue none at home, I will lend you of the
best that I haue, goe in daughter, [$quoth hir olde mother
in law,$] it is a chance, and against an ill turne sometime
no man may be: ile goe home as fast as I can, and goe
fetch you cleane linnen, the whiles drie your gowne,
and make all things els ready. I pray you do good 
mother [$ (quoth she) and next way goes hir mother in lawe:
and assoone as she was out of doores, the old woman led
hir into an inwarde Parlour where the Smith was,
and there these two louers by this policie made the
iealous Cobler were the horne.$]
   [$Whiles thus they were solacing themselues, the old
wife she came stumbling home, and for haste had like to
breake hir necke ouer the threshould, her fall made the
Cobler start, and when he saw it was his mother, and
that he mist his wife, he was halfe mad, and askt his
mother hastily where she was: the old woman short 
winded was almost out of breath, and for a good space sat
puffing and blowing to fetch winde; at last she cryed
out:$] alas deare sonne, such a chaunce as neuer was hard
of: as we went through old (^Romney^) , hard by the church,
a woman threw out a bowle of bloudie water right
vpon your wiues head, which hath so berayed hir linnen
<P 23>
and hir gowne, that she could go no further, and so I as
fast as I could came running home for clean clothes: oh
for the passion of God mother [$quoth he,$] hie to hir chest,
and get hir cloathes ready, for it may be a fetch to make
the poore Cobler a Cuckhold; a horne mother is soone
grafted: [$with that the old woman got all in a readines,
and away ran the Cobler & his mother together.$] [^...^]
[^ONCE THE COBBLER SAW HIS TEARFUL WIFE SITTING BY THE FIRE, 
WAITING FOR HER CLOTHES, HE BEGAN TO SOFTEN. SHE AND HER 
MOTHER-IN-LAW WERE THUS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE THEIR JOURNEY, 
AND HE RETURNED TO HIS SHOP. MEANWHILE, THE SMITH WAS 
BUSILY PLOTTING HOW THEY BOTH MIGHT CUCKOLD THE SMITH AGAIN.^] 
   [$It chaunced within a fortnight after, that as the
Cobler and his wife lay in bed, she fell on a great laughter,
<P 24>
hir husband demaunding the cause, she made him this 
answer.$] I will tell you husband a strange thing, so it is,
that this other day when you went to buie Lether, my
mother and I sat in the shop, and she fel fast a sleepe, your
neighbour the Smith, he, as his custome is, came to the
window, and seeing my mother a sleepe, began to court
me with faire words and large promises, and told me,
that if I would find the meanes that when you were
out, I would let him lie with me, he would giue me
fortie shillings. I shakt him off as well as I could, but he
would haue no nay at all, but threw foure Angels into
my lap: wherevpon I tooke the golde, for me thought
they were foure fayre peeces, and promised him that to
morrow you went foorth, and my mother to, and then
he should finde me alone in the chamber. Vpon this hee
went away, and left me the gold, and therfore if it please
you, to morrow I thinke good you should faine your
selfe to go abroad, and my mother to, and then hide you
in a chamber hard by, and assoone as he is come in, you
may stand at the doore and heare all our talke: when 
you heare me consent, then break in, and take the
Cobler, and swindge him well, and I warrant you husband
there will diuerse commodities rise of it: for not onely
we shall haue this gold, and get more for amends, but
euer after be rid of such a knaue.
[^THE COBBLER AGREED TO HIS WIFE'S PLAN, SO THE NEXT MORNING HE
AND HIS MOTHER PRETENDED TO LEAVE HIS WIFE ALONE, WHEREUPON THE 
SMITH ARRIVED. WHILE THE SMITH SPOKE WITH HIS LOVER IN HER BEDROOM,
THE COBBLER AND HIS MOTHER RETURNED AND STOOD OUTSIDE THE DOOR, 
LISTENING.^] 
<P 25>
[^---^] [$with that he hard the smith offer faire to his wife:$]
nay [$ (quoth she) $] I haue kept promise with you, for I 
onely promised to let you vp into my Chamber: tush [$quoth
he,$] this is but a cauille [$and many words past betweene
them: the Cobler and his mother standing at the doore,
with her naye and his yea, till the Cobler had a new
browantler growne out of his old hornes; and then shee
answered him, seeing nothing would content him, hee
should haue his pleasure: with that the Cobler was
readie to rush in, but that his mother staid him, and bid him
harke further:$] and doost thou meane good faith, [$quoth the
Smith?$] I wherefore else [$ (quoth the Coblers wife) $] came
we into this place? why then [$ (quoth the Smith) $] heare
what I will say to thee: Doost thou thinke, though we
be heere in secret, that our faults will not be seene 
openly? that though thy husband knowes not of, and that it

betweene you and my wife, and truelie: [$and with that
the Cobler wept,$] I am heartily glad I haue such a
trustie friend, to whom in my absence at any time, because
my mother is an old woman, I commit the ouersight of
my wife: and truely neighbour [$quoth hee,$] I pray you
thinke neuer the worse of hir, for she told me the whole
matter, & appointed me to stand at the doore, that when
you should haue offered hir any discurtesie, I might haue
rusht in and haue taken you: so that I perceiue you are
as honest as she, and she as honest as you, and that your
meanings were both a like. I am glad of that [$quoth the
Smith,$] that you haue so vertuous a wife, I hope I
haue done the part of a freend, to pleasure my neighbour:
you haue doone so [$quoth the Cobler,$] and therefore ere we
part, weele drinke a quart of wine. [$So the Cobler 
bestowed good cheere on the Smith, and euer after
accompted him for his friend, and whensoeuer he went out of
towne, committed the charge of his wife to the Smith,
who at all times had free egresse and regresse to the 
Coblers house without suspition.$]

   [$This tale of the Smith made al the company to laugh,
and the cobler he was starke mad for anger, saying, that
if it had beene his case, he would haue giuen him wine
with a cudgell:$] tush Cobler [$quoth the Smith,$] neuer
thinke but our art can surpasse yours in such wenching
matters, and that a Smith can sooner make a Cobler a
Cuckold, then a Cobler a Smith: [$vpon this they fell to
iarres, & from words had falne to blowes, if they of the
Barge had not parted them: so at last they were quiet,
and made friends. And then the Cobler he began to
intreate that they would go forward in their merry
exercise, wherevpon a gentleman sitting by said;$] maisters,
it is so good to passe away the time, that to continue so
honest a sport, I will be next: and thus therefore I will
describe him.

[^A SCHOLAR OF CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY HAPPENED TO SEE A 
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN WHILE AT A HOSTEL IN CHERRYHINTON, 
AND IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE. THE WOMAN NOTICED THE
SCHOLAR'S ADMIRING GLANCES, BUT TURNED TO LEAVE.^]
[^...^] [$The Scholler seeing hir going out of
doores, thought of the old prouerbe: Faint heart neuer
woone faire Lady. And therefore called to hir thus:$] Faire
Gentlewoman [$quoth he,$] you may see we Schollers haue
litle maners, that holding the pot in our hands will not
make such a sweete saint as you drinke: howe say you
Gentlewoman, will it please you to pledge mee? [$The
wily wench hearing such a Schollerlike gratulation,
seeing by this salute, that Schollers had read of Loue,
more then they could say of Loue: and though they
coulde tell what was Latine for a faire woman, yet
could neither woe hir, nor winne hir, turned backe
againe, and with a lowe curtesie thanked him. Hee off
with his corner Cappe (for hee was a Batcheler in
Artes) and with a glauncing looke drunke to hir:
Shee like a wanton, pledgde him with a smile.
(^Rowland^) at this taking heart at grasse, stept to hir, and
tooke hir by the hande: beginning thus to holde hir in
chat.$]
   Your Towne here (forsooth) of (^Cherryhinton^) , hath
made me oft play the trewa~t to come hither for cherries:
and as mine Hostes can tel, full many a messe of creame
haue I eaten in hir house: for we schollers are good 
co~panions, & loue to be pleasant: especially if we might haue
the company of such faire Gentlewomen as your selfe:
<P 30>
Therefore Mistres, if I chaunce to come to towne to eat
a pound of cherries (if I may be so bold) I would trouble
you to take part with mee; and if I meete you at
(^Cambridge^) , the best wine in the Towne shall bee your
welcome: [$the wench (that had much adooe to keepe hir 
countenance) thought to feede him vp with faire speeches, till
shee made him as fatte as a foole, and therefore made him
this reply.$] Truely syr indeede many schollers come to
(^Cherryhinton^) to eate cherries: but syr, you are the first
man that euer I dranke withall, for schollers bee so full
of their learning, and fine tearmes, that Country
wenches cannot vnderstande them, but I for my part at the
first sight like of you so well, that if my leisure serue,
whensoeuer you come and please to send for mee, I will
as long as I dare beare you company, but nowe forsooth
time cals mee away and I must bee gone. With all my
heart [$quoth (^Rowland^) ,$] but truely wee must not part
without a kisse, [$which shee willingly tooke at his hands,
and went home:$] [^---^]

[^...^] [$All they flocked about hir, to heare what excellent

writ: they all in a synode peremptorily concluded, that
the greatest Clarkes were not the wisest men:$] and I
maruaile of that [$quoth one of the company,$] for two
reasons: for the one I haue heard this old said saw, that Loue
makes men Oratours and affection whetteth on
eloquence: Secondly, there was none more amorous then
(^Ouid^) (yet a profound scholler) insomuch that he writ three
bookes (^ (\De Arte Amandi\) ^) , and so did (^Anacreon Tibullus^) ,
& (^Propertius^) . I but [$quoth an other,$] as they were
schollers, so were they well brought vp in the Court, and
knew as many externall manners, as they did inwarde
principles: but ware my Maisters, when a scholler is
once brought vp in the Vniuersities, and hath no other
bringing vp but plaine (^Ergo^) to plod in, nor conuerseth
with none but his bookes, and then hap to fall in Loue:
trust me he will bee as ignorant to wooe, as the
ploughman to dispute, thinking that womens fancies are woon
with Figures, and their thoughts ouerreacht with the
quiddities of Art: but of all that euer I heard write, this
setteth downe his minde the most simply: and therefore
[$quoth (^Marian^) $] shall hee be answerd as foolishly, for I my
selfe will be Secretary. Nay [$quoth diuers of the

shee,$] trie but a womans witte: thats knauish enough

wrote thus.$]

betrothed husband,$] and so exceedingly well, that you shall
stand for foure and twenty knaues till Christmas next.
Tush [$quoth an other,$] womens wittes are like
Sheffielde kniues, for they are sometimes so keene as they
will cutte a haire, and sometimes so blunt that they

dunces.

a light at the doore, and he heard (^Marian^) cal him:$] oh

brother and two Gentlemen more are vp at Cardes, & they
haue but a set to play, and then they will to their rest:
alas sweete heart [$ (quoth he) $] I am almost sterued for cold,
yet the hope that I haue to enioy thy presence, doth 
comfort me, that I take all things with patience. [$The
Gentlemen that stood hard by and hard all this, laught at the
scholler, and vp they went againe to their chamber to be
merry: but still walkt poore (^Rowland^) , beating his ha~ds
about him for cold, and expecting still when his Louer
should cal him: wel there he trauerst his ground stil like
a (^pery-patetian^) , and only had the sight of the heauens to
contemplate, till it was about one of the clock, and then
came they all downe againe to laugh: & assoone as he saw
the candle at the chinke of the doore, he began to be
comforted, & came thither, shaking & beating of his teeth so
<P 39>
sore, that he could not speake.$] Where are you sweet hart
[$ (quoth she) $] alas how sorry am I for thy distresse, thinke
that the heart in my belly is as colde for greefe as thy

with cold, yet were it twise as frostie, & the night thrise
as long, I would walke heere, rather then procure thy
disparagement: gramercie sweet loue [$ (quoth she) & with
that she bid him be still a while, & the Gentlemen all fell
a laughing to heare how kinde a foole the Scholler was,
and with what patience, he bid his pennance:$] oh, [$quoth
the one of them,$] this is but an experiment of his
Philosophicall principles, for he reades in (^Tully^) :

make an instance of himselfe for such axiomes, I wil
rather be a warme foole, then so colde a Philosopher. [$Thus

downe, they heard a noise at the doore, which was this
poore (^Rowland^) creeping vnder y=e= shade for warmth, his
teeth beating so lowd, that they might heare them 
easely vp the staires, all this mooued not my yoong
Mistresse to pittie, but increast their laughter. Assoone
as hee heard them come downe the staires, almost dead,

[$quoth (^Rowland^) ,$]
take pittie of my life, for I am almost dead, doo but open
the doore, and let me sit heere vpon the staires, that I
may haue some shelter from the cold. Alas [$quoth she$]
sweete loue, thou shalt and thou wilt: but when the dore
is opened, it makes such a noyse, that it wakens the
whole house. Rather, [$quoth he,$] let me suffer death, then
you be discredited, for if I were to abide the stone of
(^Sisiphus^) , the wheele of (^Ixion^) , the gripe of                #
(^Prometheus^) , & the
hunger of (^Tantalus^) , yet had I rather pocket vp all these
tortures with patience, then bring thy credit within the
compasse of the least preiudice: [$at this period she left him,
and vp they went, smiling at the constancie of (^Rowland^) .
The Gentlemen they were sleepie, and went to bed, and
(^Marian^) , as far as I can coniecture, though it were 
somwhat before the mariage, that night made triall of hir
new betrothed husband, where from three, she lay with
him till six, and then it waxed day light, and she rose; and
remembring her louer went downe, opened the doore,
and found him almost sencelesse: there wiping hir eyes,
as though shee had wept, shee perswaded him that shee
was the most sorrowfull woman in the world for his
sharpe frostie night he had suffered, protesting she was
falne into an ague, for very feare & greefe she had taken
to see him in such distresse, & could by no meanes redresse
it:$] but good (^Rowland^) [$ (quoth shee) $] be content, hie thee to
(^Cambridge^) , and take some hot broaths, least by this
meanes thou fall into a sicknesse, & then for very sorrow
I dye: no [$quoth (^Rowland^) , & he could scarse speake or go,$]
feare not me, for the hope of thy after fauours, will be a
sufficient comfort for me: [$and with that taking his leaue
for his cold nights worke he had a kisse, and so departed.$]
[^FOLLOWING THIS, ROWLAND WAS ILL FOR THREE MONTHS. BY THE 
TIME HE HAD RECOVERED, IT WAS NEARING MARIAN'S WEDDING DAY, AND 
SHE DECIDED TO PLAY ONE LAST TRICK ON HIM.^] 
<P 41>
[^...^] [$As shee and
the rest of hir friends which were inuited to the 
nuptials were merilie iesting,$] oh Lord [$ (quoth shee) $] I had 
almost forgot my selfe, tomorrow must be the wedding,
and the bride is at Cambridge: why gentlemen it were
no bargaine if (^Rowland^) were not here: therefore [$quoth
she,$] I will send for him, and lay such a plotte that hee
shall be with vs all dinner, & yet tast none of our meat.
I pray you [$quoth her husband,$] let vs see your cu~ning in
that. Alas [$quoth one of the gentlemen,$] poore (^Rowland^)
is credulous, and whatsoeuer mistres (^Marian^) saith, hee
thinks it is Gospel: but if he wil be so simple as to think
that his last nights worke is not a sufficient warning,
hee is worthie of whatsoeuer befalles. [$Well, vpon this
(^Marian^) sent for him, and come hee did in the euening, 
where, to make my tale short, she made him walk in his
wonted state [^SOURCE TEXT: statie^] till one of the clocke: then    #
she let him into
a good fire, where he well warmed him selfe, and she
louingly sate by him, discoursing of the last nightes worke
<P 42>
that he abode so patientlie: at last she commaunded the
maide to lay the cloth that they might haue some
(^ (\quelque chose\) ^) for a readie supper, which they went busilie
about: for (^Rowland^) said he was verie hungrie. As the
cloth was laid, and they readie to sit downe the wench
came running in, and said that hir Maister was rising,
and seeing the light of the fier was comming into the
Parlor.$] Alas what shal I do [$quoth (^Maria~^) ?$] hide me some
where [$quoth (^Rowland^) $] whiles he be gone to bed. Come
[$quoth she,$] here stands a new truncke and a large, come,
skippe into it, and I will for a while rake vp the fire and
goe to bed while the old man be fallen a sleepe: [$with that
(^Rowland^) whipt into the truncke, and she lockt him in, &
straight in a pleasant humor went to hir new husband,
where shee lay al night, and left (^Rowland^) safe shut vp
for starting. Still laie hee expecting when she should
come, but hearing nothing, extremely wearie for
verie griefe hee fell a sleepe till the next morning.$]
[$When the poore scholler awakt and entred into 
consideration where he was, he began to be halfe in suspition
that he was mockt and abused, still he lay patiently till
hee heard them of the house say,$] God morrow mistres
(^Marian^) , God send you a good day, to day the Sun shines
faire, you shal haue a cleere daie to your wedding. [^...^]
[^ROWLAND WAS FORCED TO LISTEN TO ALL THE WEDDING FESTIVITIES FROM 
THE CHEST. THOSE FESTIVITIES CONTINUED UNTIL THE REMAINS OF SUPPER 
WERE CLEARED AWAY.^]

[^...^] [$When the cloth was taken vp
the Bride fetcht a great sigh:$] what wife [$quoth y=e=
Bridegrome,$] why sigh you? in a dumpe? repent you of the
match? no [$quoth shee,$] but I haue a blot in my conscience,
and now before you all I meane to reueale it. I was
once beloued of a Cambridge scholler, who loued me
intierlie and suffred much for my sake: [$then from point to
point shee recompted vnto them the whole discourse
of the loues and fortunes passed betweene
(^Rowland^) and hir, whereat the companie had good sport.$]
   A man hee was [$quoth shee,$] wise, proper, and well
proportioned: and for proofe hould the key, open the
truncke [$quoth shee,$] and I will shew you his picture.
[$ (^Rowland^) hearing this, armd himselfe to suffer al: and so
the truncke was opened & he rose out like (^Lazarus^) from
his graue.$] Good Lord [$quoth the companie,$] what is this
a spirit? (^ (\In nomine Iesus vnde venis? E purgatorio\) ^) [$quoth
(^Rowland^) . And with that all the companie laught while
they could sit. At last when they were wearie with
laughing (^Rowland^) had silence, hee boldlie said:$] thus I
am glad gentlemen that my mishap hath made you so
merrie, and that mistres bride hath so large a plaine
song to runne descant on; (^ (\Caueat Emptor\) ^) : this is but a
comedie, but looke for a tragedie when soeuer it falles.

down together, & I wil say my charme, & so we shal liue
at rest. [$ (^Peter^) y=t= thought som other frend had bin with his
Le~man, taking it in scorn y=t= hir husband (as he thought)
being fro~ home he should not be let in, knockt againe
amaine. With y=t= (^Myzaldo^) & his wife arose, lighted a
candle, & went downe to the dore where (^Peter^) was: Then
she wisht hir husband to kneele downe vpon his knees
while she said the charme. With that she began thus.$]
[^VERSE OMITTED.^]
   Now husband [$quoth she,$] spit: [$& with that he spit, and
Peter laught hartily, and wisht he might spit out his
teeth for being at home. This charme said shee thrise
<P 63>
ouer, and euery time made him spit, that (^Peter^) might be
assuredly perswaded that hir husband was at home. Vpon
this (^Myzaldo^) and his wife went to bed, and heard the
spirit no more: for (^Peter^) we~t laughing home to his lodging.$]
[^PETER DEVISED ANOTHER SIGNAL -- A STRING TIED AROUND HIS LOVER'S
TOE. BUT MYZALDO DISCOVERED THE STRING WHILE HIS WIFE SLEPT AND,
FEARING HE WAS BEING MADE A CUCKOLD, TIED IT TO HIS OWN TOE. WHEN IT
WENT TAUT, HE RUSHED OUT BUT PETER MANAGED TO SLIP AWAY. ENRAGED, 
MYZALDO RETURNED TO THE BEDROOM AND BEAT HIS WIFE, OR SO HE THOUGHT,
FOR HIS WIFE HAD CONVINCED HER MAID TO TAKE HER PLACE. NEXT MORNING, 
MYZALDO WENT TO INFORM HIS INLAWS.^] 
<P 64>
[$Vpon this they went home with (^Myzaldo^) to his house, and
there comming vp the staires they found their daughter
sitting verie sad: the husband fround and bretheren scoulded,
but y=e= mother whom nature more neerely toucht, said,$] what
cheere daughter? what stir is this betweene your husband &
you? what stir [$quoth hir daughter?$] marrie I would you &
my brethren had gone to my burying whe~ you went to my
mariage to wed mee to a dronckard, that all day goes out
<P 65>
about whores and curtisans, and at night comes home late,
and perhaps not all night, as he hath doone now, and so doo
I sit all day comfortlesse, and lie in the night like a widow
while he is abroad with his strumpets. And [$quoth the
mother$] he is this morning come to your brethren and me, with
an outcrie against you, that this night he tooke you with a
Lemman at the doore, and how he found it out by a string
tied to your toe. Fie vpon him dronkard [$ (quoth she) $] these
are his dreames, when he lies tipled in the Tauerne: but I
maruell where he hath beene to night: marry Dame [$quoth
he,$] I feare me your flesh and your bones knowe too well,
for I thinke you haue not one free spot on your body, I so
whipt you for your whoredome, and I thinke the sheetes in
the bed can witnesse, and the haire that I cut off your head
can testifie. Now mother [$ (quoth she) $] and good brethren, see
whether this is an arrand droonkard or not, that tels these
fables, saying, he beat me thus to night, when he toucht me
not, nor before this time since yesterday morning, came
within these doores: where he saies the sheetes are bloudie,
see brethren see, they are cleane: for my skin, take view of it,
if it be any way toucht: and for my haire, see how faire and
long it is: how hath he then done these prankes? alas, alas,
he hath falne amongst his whores in his droonkennesse, and
hath vsed them so, and now to the slander of me, to the
dishonour of my freends, and the perpetuall infamie of our house,
he hath thus without cause reuiled me, where yee see his
owne lying toong condemnes him. [$ (^Mizaldo^) , seeing neither
his wiues haire cut, nor hir bodie any way brused, fell into
a great dumpe, woondering whether he drempt it or no, in
so much, that at last he askt:$] whie Wife? was I not this
night at home? at home, in faith sir no, but with some of your
drabs, & I thinke thou camest home dronke. [$At this doubtful
demaund, hir brethren began to take hir part, & seeing what
he said was false, & al hir speeches probable, they raild on him
in most bitter termes, & told him in that he had maried their
sister who was an honest woma~, & he by all means sought to
depriue hir of hir good name without cause, who should be y=e=

protector of hir honor, they would not put it vp vnreuenged,
but would to the vttermost do him what iniurie the
extremitie of the law would affoord. Vpon this, the man seeing
how in all things his wife had disprooued him, thought
assuredly that he was not at home the last night, and therfore
desired hir to pardon him, and he would neuer after be take~
in the like offence, and so vpon that, by hir mother and hir
brethren they were made friends, and euer after (^Peter^) and
she with lesse suspition enioyed their loues.$]

[^WHILE WALKING IN THE FIELDS ONE DAY, A FARMER'S WIFE IS 
MET BY AN ABBOT. THE ABBOT SOON REVEALS THAT HE HAS 
STRONG FEELINGS FOR HER, BUT SHE WARNS HIM THAT HER HUSBAND 
IS AN EXCEEDINGLY JEALOUS MAN.^]
[^...^] Tushe [$ (quoth the Abbot) $] care not for that,
referre that matter to mee, I will straight cure him of
his iealousie, if then thou wilt bee my paramour. [$So
sore was the poore woman troubled with a iealous foole,
that shee was glad to graunt whatsoeuer the Abbot
would aske, so hir husband might bee mended of his fault:$]
make some excuse [$quoth the Abbot,$] send him to me to
morrow, and then let me alone: but whatsoeuer thou hearest
is befallen him, feare not, all shall be well. [$Vpon that the
Farmars Wife and the Abbot parted, shee to hir house, he
to his cloister, where hee called one of his Monkes, in
whome he did repose all his trust, and reuealed vnto him
the whole matter, and what plot hee had laid to bring his
purpose to passe: the Moonke condiscended to doe 
whatsoeuer the Abbot should commaund, and so vpon this
resolution they laught, and the next day came the Farmar to
the Abbot to haue a hie masse said for one of his Children
that was sick: the Abbot made much of him, and bad him to
<P 69>
dinner, and subtilly at his last draught conueied a dormatiue
potion into the cup, that presently after dinner he fell into a
dead sleepe; that his senses being gone all men thought he
was deade: wherefore presently one of the Monkes ran to
the good wife, and tolde hir what had happened to hir 
husband: shee cried out and wrung hir hands, and tolde it to hir
neighbours: whereupon shee and a great company both of
men and women went to the Abbey, and there was hee knit
vp in his winding sheete, the wife pittifully lamented, and
the neighbours comforted hir: the Abbot he saide he should be
buried in their Abbey because he died there, and therefore in
presence of them all solemnely buried him: which done, his
wife like a sorrowfull woman departed home to hir house
with hir neighbours.$]
   [$Assoone as night came, the Abbot and the Monke,
(whom hee had made priuy to this practise) went and
cunningly tooke him out of his graue, and carried him into a
deepe dungeon, where he could see no light, and there let him
lie starke naked, till such time as the potion had ended the
operation, and that hee should wake. At length the Farmar
awoke, and stretching himselfe, finding that he was naked, and
in a place lothsome, darke, and fearefull, he could not tel what
to thinke, but blest himselfe, and said,$] Lord haue mercie vpon
me, where am I? [$The Monke that was by attired like a
spirite, saide,$] thou art deade and in purgatory. Deade [$quoth the
Farmer:$] can dead men speak? Yea [$quoth the Monke,$] and eat
too, such meate and drinke as is appointed for the dead: This
day in the morning thou didst die, and thy wife did bury thee
in the Abbey, accompanied with all hir neighbours: and I
wretch a spirite of purgatorie, am appointed to torment thee
without ceasing, for that in thy life time thou wert iealous,
and didst misuse thy wife without cause, therefore am I
appointed to vexe thee threescore and tenne yeares without
ceasing: [$and with that hauing a whippe in his hande, the
Monke laide it on, and gaue him many a shrewde blowe: At
last he left him and went his way, and told the Abbot what he
had done.$]
[^THE ABBOT SPENT MANY NIGHTS WITH THE FARMER'S WIFE. WHEN 
SHE BECAME PREGNANT, THEY DECIDED TO RESURRECT THE PENITENT 
FARMER. HE WAS GIVEN A SECOND SLEEPING POTION, AND MOVED 
BACK TO HIS BURIAL SITE. THE MONK, MEANWHILE, FEIGNED
PRAYER SO THAT HE COULD BE CLOSE BY WHEN THE FARMER AWOKE.^]
<P 70>
[^---^] [$and
assoone as euer he saw him stir, he ranne away and cried out:
vpon this all the Monkes of the Cloister rose, and askt what
the matter was.$] Oh [$quoth hee,$] as I was in praier by the
Farmers graue, I heard a tumbling and a voice there either
of him or of a spirite? [$with that the Monkes went downe and
found that there was one aliue within the Tombe: then they
<P 71>
called the Abbot and tolde him, who slipping on his night
gowne, ran apace to see the miracle: when he came there, and
they were all gathered together, they lifted vp the stone, and
there lay he tumbling in his sheete: so they tooke him out and
vndid him, and he looked wan and gash, but spake to them
and tolde them, that the Lorde at the praiers of his wife had
restored him to life, and that hee had beene in purgatory, and
what punishment hee had abidden for his iealousie. The
Monkes were proude of this miracle, and knewe that their
Abbey should bee more famous for this strange wonder, and
straight sent for his wife and his neighbours: who when they
came, first the Abbot reuealed vnto them, howe that hee and
his Monkes hearing the continuall plaintes and praiers the
poore widow made for hir husband; he did likewise with
earnest Orisons intreat of God, that if it were his wil, he would
shew a miracle in him, and restore him to life:$] and nowe my
Maisters and friendes [$quoth hee,$] see the difference betweene
the praiers of an Abbot, and the praiers of a lay man: for
follow me and you shall see what effect they haue taken. [$With
that he carried them into the parlor where the Farmer was,
assoone as they sawe him, they were all amazed, and his wife
fel down in a sound:$] [^---^]
