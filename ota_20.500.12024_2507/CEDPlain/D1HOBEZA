   [$Question 1.$] 
Wherefore hath God placed vs in this worlde?
   [$ (^A.^) $] To know and serue him.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVill he be knowne and serued according to
our vnderstanding & wil: or according to that, which
it hath pleased himselfe, to declare and sette out vnto
vs touching the same?
   [$ (^An.^) $] According to that which hee hath
declared vnto vs concerning the same.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] VVher hath he declared and set out the same
vnto vs?
   [$ (^A.^) $] In that booke which wee cal the
Bible, comprehending togither with diuers
histories, the Law and the Gospell.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] VVho hath made this booke?
   [$ (^A.^) $] God himselfe, by the ministery of his
holy Prophets and Apostles.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] VVhat is the Lawe?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The doctrin which teacheth vs what
we ought to do, as wel towards God, as one
of vs towards another.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] VVhat is the Gospell?
   [$ (^A.^) $] That heauenlye doctrine which
teacheth vs, what we must beleeue to our
saluation thorow Jesus Christ only.
<P A1V>
   [$ (^Qu. 7.^) $] Doth this vvord contayne all that which we
must beleue and doe?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yea, without hauing any neede to ad
or ioyne anye thing thereto, or to take anye
thing therefrom.
   [$ (^Qu. 8.^) $] Say novv the articles of your beliefe.
   [$ (^A.^) $] I beleue in god, the father almighty. &c.

[} (^THE SECOND SECTION.^) }]
   [$ (^Qu. 1.^) $] Doth this doctrine teach vs that there is but
one onely God, or that there are more Gods then one?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It teacheth that there is but one God
only, and that we may not haue more.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVherefore say you so?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Because it must nedes be, y=t= he which
is God, shoulde bee aboue all other thinges,
and therefore hee may not haue a fellowe or
companion ioyned with him.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] Yet you in naming God haue seemed to
rehearse three, that is to say, the father, the sonne, & the
holy Ghost?
   [$ (^A.^) $] In dede there are three persons in one
only Godhead: but yet these three persons
are but one, and the selfe same onely God.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] Meane you that God is deuided into three
partes?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, for God cannot bee deuided, but
I say, that euery one of these thre persons is
one, and the selfe same onely God
altogeather perfect.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] How can this be?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is a misterye or secreat beyond al
<P A2R>
our vnderstanding, and yet notwithstanding
most certaine and sure, for God hath so
declared it, and set it forth vnto vs, by hys
holy word.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] Doe you then beleeue in one onely God,
the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yea: and by Gods goodnes, will dye
in thys fayth.

[} (^THE THIRD SECTION.^) }]
   [$ (^Qu. 1.^) $] How is the sonne of God called?
   [$ (^A.^) $] IESUS CHRIST.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVhat meane these words Iesus Christe?
   [$ (^A.^) $] (^Iesus^) is as much to say, as Sauiour,
and (^Christ^) is as much as annointed and
co~secrated to be our soueraigne king, hauing
power ouer all creatures, our soueraigne or
high prophet, who hath fullye declared vnto
vs the will of God his father, touching our
saluation, and our soueraigne or high priest,
which hath fullye appeased and pacified the
wrath of God against vs for our sinnes.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] VVhat hath he don and suffered to saue vs?
   [$ (^A.^) $] He was conceiued by the holy ghost,
and borne of the Virgin Mary, suffered
vnder Pontious Pilate. &c.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] Can God suffer or dye?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No,
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] Is not Iesus Christ true and very God
eternall, vvith his father and the holy ghoste?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yea.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] Howe then is he sayd to haue dyed?
<P A2V>
   [$ (^A.^) $] Because that being verye God, hee
was made man also, to the ende that in hys
person our nature might beare or suffer the
whole punishmente due to our sinnes and
transgressions.
   [$ (^Qu. 7.^) $] Do you meane that the sonne of God was
chaunged into man?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, because then he shuld be no more
God: & God can not eyther change himselfe
or be changed. But being of himselfe verye
God, hee hath taken our nature vnto
hymselfe, that so he might be very God and very
man.
   [$ (^Qu. 8.^) $] If he had not bin God, could he haue bine
our sauiour.
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, for it belongeth vnto God only
to pardon and forgiue sinnes, and to giue
eternall life.
   [$ (^Qu. 9.^) $] And if he had not bin man, could he haue
bin our sauiour?
   [$ (^A.^) $] If he had not bin man, he coulde not
haue dyed, and therfore we our selues should
haue bin subiect vnto death.

[} (^THE FOURTH SECTION^) }]
   [$ (^Qu. 1.^) $] Shall all the world be saued?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, for the greater part of the world
refuse their saluation.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVho then are they which shall be saued?
   [$ (^A.^) $] They that haue fayth and beleeue.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] And vvhat is fayth?
   [$ (^A.^) $] A certaine perswasion and assurance,
<P A3R>
which euery true Christian man oughte to
haue, that God the father loueth him, for
Iesus Christ his sons sake.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] VVherfore do you say for Iesus Christs sake?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Bicause that wee being altogither
corrupted and wholy peruerse in our selues,
God could not loue vs, but in respect of him
onelye, which is man altogether iuste and
perfect, that is to saye, Iesus Christe hys
sonne.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] Commeth this fayth of our selues?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, but from the onely grace and
goodnesse of God, which doth freely giue it
to his elect and chosen ones.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] And they which haue this faith ar they saued?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yea of necessity, for God hath giuen
his sonne to the ende that euerye one which
beleueth in him, should haue life euerlasting:
and he is not a lyer.
[} (^THE FIFTH SECTION.^) }]
   [$ (^Qu. 1.^) $] But vvhereby may a man know whether he
haue faith or no?
   [$ (^A.^) $] By good workes.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVhich be good workes, and which be euill?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Those onely are good which he
hymselfe hath commanded, and those euill which
he hath forbidden.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] Rehearse now the commandements of God?
   [$ (^A.^) $] (^Heare Israel. &c.^) The summe
wherof is, thou shalt loue the Lord thy God.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] To know Gods commaundements is not
<P A3V>
onely to know to say them, but men muste also
vnderstand that vvhich they say: wherfore I demaund of you
vvhat meaneth that vvhich is sayde in the thirde
commaundement, to take the name of GOD?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is to name God which we must
neuer doe, but vppon iust and good cause, and
with feare of his maiesty whom we name.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] Then it is by stronger and greater reason
more forbidden to sweare by God in vaine, that is to
say, to take him for a vvitnes and iudge, without iuste
and good cause vvhy?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is so in deede.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] VVhat meaneth it to sanctifie the Sabaoth
day or day of rest?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is to dedicate and consecrate it to
the glory of God.
   [$ (^Qu. 7.^) $] Ought vve not also to dedicate vnto him al
the rest of the dayes of our life?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yea but this day is particularly and
chiefely ordeyned for this end and purpose.
   [$ (^Qu. 8.^) $] Doe men forbid to trauaile or vvorke on the
saboth day, as thogh to labor wer a thing euil of it self?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, but they forbid ordinary and
vsuall labor, to doe a worke which is better and
more profitable.
[} (^THE SIXT SECTION.^) }]
   [$ (^Qu. 1.^) $] You haue said that they only are good works
which God hath commanded. VVherfore tel me can
we acco~plish & fulfil the commaundements of God?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, not so much as begin to doe anye
thing, but by a certaine singuler and speciall
grace of God. Yea there neuer hath bine or
<P A4R>
shall be a man, excepting Iesus Christ only,
which hath perfectly fulfilled the same.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVherefore say you so?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Because God will saue vs thorowe
his onely mercy in Iesus Christ.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] Yet so it is that a good life is the way to
saluation?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is true, that repentaunce &
amendment is ioyned with the forgiuenesse of our
sinnes: but yet followeth not therevpon that
we be saued by our workes.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] And vvhy shall vvee not bee saued by oure
vvorks, seeing that they are good?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Because they be not good ynough for
that purpose.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] VVherefore then are they good?
   [$ (^A.^) $] To set forth Gods honour: to winne
or else to strengthen our neighbours, and to
make vs know and feele in our selues, that
we are the children of God.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] Good vvorks then make vs not gods childre~?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, for contrariwise, a man must first
be the childe of God before hee can doe good
workes: but this is a marke or badge
wherby a man may know the children of God.
   [$ (^Qu. 7.^) $] VVhat then maketh vs the children and
sonnes of God?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The onely grace and mercye of God,
by his holye spirite, because hee hath elected
and chosen vs from before all
euerlastingnes, according to hys good pleasure.
[} (^THE SEUENTH SECTION^) }]
<P A4V>
   [$ (^Qu 1.^) $] The holy ghost then is he vvhich maketh vs
the children of God: but vvhat instruments or means
doth he ordinarily and commonly vse to bring vs to
that honour and keepe vs in the same?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The preaching of the worde, prayer,
and the vse of the Sacraments.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVhat call you preaching of the word?
   [$ (^A.^) $] An exposition of the writinges of the
Prophets and Apostles, which is don in the
Church by such as he hath called to that
holy ministry: of whom it is sayd: he that
receiueth you, receiueth me.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] Hovv doe you pray?
   [$ (^A.^) $] (^Saying.^) O our father which art in
heauen. &c.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] To whom speak you these words?
   [$ (^A.^) $] To God the Father.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] Hovv is he your father, seing that he hath
but one onely Sonne, that is to saye, IESVS
CHRIST?
   [$ (^A.^) $] First bicause that Iesus Christe his
eternall sonne, being made man is become
our brother: secondly bicause he loueth me in
Iesus Christ his sonne, with a greater then
a fatherly loue and affection.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] Albeit then that you direct not your speach
and words, eyther to the Sonne or to the holy ghost,
yet you doe not exclude or shutte out eyther the one
or the other.
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, for I can not cal him father but
in the name of his sonne Iesus Christe, nor
pray vnto him but by the holy Ghost.
<P B1R>
   [$ (^Qu. 7.^) $] And is it not lavvful for a man to frame or
make his prayer to the person of the sonne & of the
holy Ghost?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Yea in deede. For seeing that the
three persons are one only, and the selfe same
God, inuocation or prayer both equally
belong vnto them. And whether I call vpon
the father in the name of the son by the holye
ghost, or that I make my praier vnto y=e= sone
to lead and bring me to the father, or that I
pray the holy ghost to teach me the father &
the sonne, all commeth to one.

[} (^THE EYGHT SECTION^) }]

   [$ (^Qu. 1.^) $] And vvhat is a Sacrament?
   [$ (^A.^) $] It is a thing which God setteth
before mens eyes in his Church, to signifie
vnto vs for our saluation, an other thing which
men see not.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] And wherefore hath God ordeyned these
signes to his promises?
   [$ (^A.^) $] For to make vs so much the more
assured of the certainty of them.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] Hovve manye suche signes are there in the
christian Church?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Two, that is to saye, Baptisme, and
the holy Supper.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] VVhat see you in Baptisme?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Water.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] VVhat doth this water signifie vnto you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The bloud of Iesus Christ.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] To vvhat ende?
<P B1V>
   [$ (^A.^) $] To make cleane my sinnes, as the
water being occupied maketh cleane the
filthines of the body.
   [$ (^Qu. 7.^) $] Doth this water make cleane and purge sins?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, but it signifieth vnto mee, that
which washeth my sinnes, to wit, the bloude
of Iesus Christ.
   [$ (^Qu. 8.^) $] Meane you that this matter or substance of
the bloud of Iesus Christ vvasheth our soules?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, for our soules can not be clensed
with any matter as our bodyes. But this
bloud maketh me cleane, because that Iesus
Christ hath shed it for satisfaction and ful
recompence for my sinnes.
   [$ (^Qu. 9.^) $] Is there anye difference betwene                 #
[^SOURCE TEXT: betewene^] the water
of Baptisme, and common vvater [^SOURCE TEXT: vvatet^] ?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, as concerning the matter and
substance (for it is alwayes water) but there
is very great difference, as concerning the
vse: for the common water serueth to washe
and make cleane our bodely filthinesses, and
the water vsed in Baptisme, is a sacrament
of the washing of our soules.
[} (^THE NINTH SECTION^) }]
   [$ (^Qu. 1.^) $] VVhat see you in the supper?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The bread and the wine which is ther
giuen and receiued, according to the
ordinance and institution of God.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVhat doth this bread and this vvine
signifie vnto you?
   [$ (^A.^) $] The bread signifieth to me, the bodye
<P B2R>
crucified for me, and the wine signifieth vnto
me, the bloud shed out for me.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] To what end?
   [$ (^A.^) $] To testifie vnto me, & to assure me that
euen as this bread & this wine, are ordeyned
for the maintenance and nourishment of this
life, so our Lord Iesus Christ hath giuen his
body and his bloud for me, & giueth himselfe
to me, to the ende that from him, as from a
fountaine, there may flowe vnto me eternall
life.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] Are this bread and vvine our spirituall
nourishment?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, but they signifie vnto vs y=t= from
whence very eternall lyfe it selfe procedeth,
that is to saye, from him which hath suffered
his death and passion, to take away the cause
of our death, that is to saye sinnes, and to
renue vs vnto eternall life, thorow a spirituall
liuelinesse, which resteth and remaineth in
him.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] Is there any difference betvvene the breade
and vvine vsed in this sacrament, and common breade
and vvine?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, as touching the matter and
substance, (for it is alwayes bread and wine:)
but there is very great difference, as
concerning the vse: for ordinary and co~mon meates
are appoynted for the vse of this present life,
but this sacrament is ordeined to signify and
<P B2V>
seale vnto vs our spirituall and euerlasting
nourishment.
[} (^THE TENTH SECTION.^) }]
   [$ (^Qu. 1.^) $] VVherefore hath the Lord ordeyned &
instituted tvvo signes in his holy Supper, seing that in
Baptisme there is but one onely.
   [$ (^A.^) $] To assure vs that hee doth not feede
vs to the halues but wholly, being not only
our meate but also our drinke.
   [$ (^Qu. 2.^) $] VVhere is Iesus Christ nowe according to
hys humaine nature?
   [$ (^A.^) $] In heauen, from whence he shal come
to iudge the liuing and the dead.
   [$ (^Qu. 3.^) $] By what meanes can you then which are
on the earth receiue him?
   [$ (^A.^) $] As I receiue with my hande and my
mouth the Sacrament, that is to saye, that
bread and that wine, for the nourishment of
this body, euen so by the vertue, and power
of the holye ghoste, I doe in wardly and in
my soule receiue and imbrace thorowe fayth
our Lord Iesus Christ, very God and verye
man, that by him I may liue eternally.
   [$ (^Qu. 4.^) $] Doe they which haue no faith receiue Iesus
Christ in the Supper?
   [$ (^A.^) $] No, for Iesus Christ is not receiued
but by faith, yet doe they in deede receiue the
sacraments, but to their condemnation.
   [$ (^Qu. 5.^) $] Hovv so?
   [$ (^A.^) $] Because that they make no differe~ce
betwene common bread and common wine,
<P B3R>
and that which is the sacrament of the body
and bloud of Iesus Christ, whom they reiect
and throw from the~ thorowe their vnbeleife.
   [$ (^Qu. 6.^) $] How must a man prepare himselfe to come
worthely to the supper.
   [$ (^A.^) $] If he haue true repentance of the life
that is passed, confessing their sinnes before
God, and amending them towards God and
his brethren, so much as in him lyeth, wyth
a ful deliberation and purpose to doe better
in time to come, and imbracing Iesus Christ
by a true fayth in his promises and
Sacraments for the alone and onely sauiour.
   [$ (^Qu. 7.^) $] But hath Iesus Christ left it vnto our
libertye and choyse, whether vve will go to the supper, or
not goe to it?
   [$ (^A.^) $] In forbidding men to resort thither
vnworthily, he co~mandeth al them which haue
iudgement and discretion, to prepare
themselues that they may repaire worthily to it.
