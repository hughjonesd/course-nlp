[^A HUSBAND, JEALOUS OF HIS WIFE, ARIANA, HAS MADE HER ACCOMPANY HIM 
ON A HUNT. BUT ARIANA HAS FOUND A HANDSOME YOUTH, BOUND AND GAGGED, 
IN THE FOREST. THIS PROVES TO BE A TRICK TO ENABLE HIM TO SEDUCE 
ARIANA AS SOON AS SHE UNTIES HIM. SHE THINKS THIS IRONIC AFTER ALL HER 
HUSBAND'S EFFORTS.^]         
[^---^] [$She had no sooner
ended this Thought; but she hears
(^Crafty's^) Voice amongst the rest of the
Chasers, tho' in a far different Tone,$]
Holla, ho, ho, ho, (^Jolar, Caesar, 
Ringwood^) , [$&c. would the Hunters Cry:$]
But oho, oho, (^Ariana^) , Wife, (^Ariana^) ,
Wife, where are you? [$Would he bawl
out.$]
<P 34>
   [$She would fain have answered him,
but fearing the Transports of his Rage,
thought it best to be Silent, which
(^Courtall^) look'd upon as no ill Omen 
of his happy Success: He apply'd
himself to her in the best Language he
was able, and she as stoutly withstood
him; at last he told her down-right,
that since he had her in his Power,
he could use her as he pleas'd; 
however, 'twas not to satisfy his Lust, but
(if it were possible) to gain her Love
and Favour; on which he set a higher
Value, than on all the things in the
World beside. (^Ariana^) considering that
few who had the Substance in their
Hands would let it go for a Shadow,
could not but highly admire the
Passion of this Youth, and began now
to look on him with more
favourable Eyes; she promis'd him any
thing, so he would let her escape at
that time; in short, he made her
regally sensible, that his had been a
Passion of long standing, and that if she
would only permit him the Liberty
to love her, and now and then to see
<P 35>
her, 'twas all he design'd, and the
utmost reach of his desires: She at last
granted him so much, but told him,
he must be very circumspect and
cautious in his Addresses, for that should
her Husband have the least Suspicion,
she were undone for ever. (^Courtall^)
made her a Thousand Protestations of
his Fidelity and Secresy in every thing,
and desir'd her to bind and gag him
in earnest, and when she should meet
with her Husband, to bring him that
way as by chance, by which he did
not question to gain his Acquaintance.$]
[^ARIANA FOLLOWED COURTALL'S INSTRUCTIONS
AND ALTHOUGH CRAFTY WAS INITIALLY SUSPICIOUS,
HE WAS QUICKLY SATISFIED THAT THE YOUTH WAS NO
THREAT TO HIM.^]
<P 36>
[^---^] [$He soon put off his Fright, and went
in to unloose him; which he no sooner 
had done, but (^Courtall^) (first 
thanking him for his timely Assistance)
told him the dismallest Story of his
being robb'd of his Wife, by a Man
who had long pretended Love to her
before he was so unhappy as to marry
her, and that he was almost famish'd,
with Hunger and Cold, he having
been left in the condition he found
him in ever since yesterday about
Noon.$]

   [$ (^Crafty^) could not but pitty his
Misfortune, and hearing him say he was 
married, thought the less Danger,
<P 37>
invited him to go home along with
him, promis'd him all the Assistance
that he was capable of affording him.
(^Courtall^) return'd him a Million of
Thanks, but withal told him, if he
was a married Man, he must intreat
his Excuse, for that he had Vow'd
a mortal Aversion to the whole
Female Sex. These Words so pleas'd
the old Man, that now he was
pressing, and would take no denial. But
(^Courtall^) , to gain more on his
credulity, told him, if he would sell him
his Horse and Furniture, he would
pay him his Price, and go to some
remote Part of the Kingdom, where
he might never more be heard of;$]
for [$ (says he) $] my Friends and 
Neighbours will so Jeer and Scoff at me,
telling me I am but justly serv'd
for my Jealousie, that I had rather
be a Slave, and tug at an Oar, than
endure the Reproaches I am sure to
meet with. [^...^]
<P 38>
[^COURTALL'S WORDS SO PLEASED THE OLD MAN THAT HE OFFERED
HIM A HOME. HE ALSO OFFERED HIM THE USE OF HIS HORSE. HOWEVER, 
THE HORSE HAD RETURNED HOME SHORTLY AFTER ARIANA.^]
[^---^] 
[$She began to be troubled, and 
commanded her Servants to search out
every where to find their Master, and
to see what was the reason of his
Horses returning home empty. Every
one mounted a Horse, and to loose no
time, the Groom leaps upon the little
<P 39>
Nag, which (^Ariana^) had rid, whose
Side-saddle was not yet taken off,
and as Fortune would have it, he
gave this Horse the Reins and the
Spur, who having but lately come
from the Place where (^Courtall^) was,
made thither again, where he espy'd
his Master and this Gentleman 
walking on Foot in their Boots: He told
him his Mistress had sent all the
House in quest of him, fearing some
Misfortune had happen'd, seeing his
Horse return home without him;
(^Crafty^) made some Question to his
Man, and ask'd [^SOURCE TEXT: as'd^] how long his Mistress
had been at home? Who answer'd
him above an Hour ago. (^Crafty^) would
have had (^Courtall^) got up and rid,
but he told him, he had rather walk
it on Foot, besides he knew not how
to sit on a Side-saddle; wherefore the
old Man bids his Servant hast home,
and get a good Fire and a Bed made
with all speed, in the Lodge at the
end of the Orchard, and provide a
good Supper for the Entertainment of
that Gentleman, a Friend of his.$]
<P 40>   
   [$ (^Jeremy^) backs as fast as he could
Gallop, and was the first who brought
his Mistress News of his Master, and
withal deliver'd the Errand he was
sent about. (^Ariana^) was so pleas'd at
the Adventure, (for now she began to
admire young (^Courtall^) for his
cunning Admission) gave her Man a Crown
piece for the News, which (^Jeremy^)
took for a great Proof of the Love she
had to her Husband. (^Ariana^) found
but small resistance in her Heart,
and thought her self obliged to
return the tenders of one who lov'd
her so dearly, gave Orders that all
things should be quickly performed
that her Husband had commanded,
and that the Room might be made
the more fit for his Reception, she
went her self to see every thing
done, and took more than ordinary
care that his Bed should be well
made.$]

   [$ (^Courtall^) could by no means be
perswaded to enter the House, but
desired the old Man to Conduct him to
<P 41>
the Chamber assign'd, that none of
his Servants might see him. (^Crafty^)
not knowing that all things were in 
so good order as they were, made 
him many Excuses of the ill
Furniture he would find in the Room;
for says he,$] 'tis a Place where no
one has lain in since a Parson of
(^Kingston^) , who us'd to Study there;
[$and that all the use they put it to
now, was, that Mr. (^Lilly^) would 
sometimes (the House standing upon an
high Hill) make his Observations, and
erect his Schemes in it.$] 'Twas in
this Place, [$ (says he) $] that he made 
his Prognostication of the Three
Blazing Stars, and foretold their Effect
some Years after they were past.

   [$ (^Courtall^) listned to this Discourse,
which he hop'd would prove to his 
Advantage hereafter. But by this time
they were come to the Lodge;
(^Ariana^) not thinking her Husband would 
bring him to that Place first, stay'd
to expect when she should be sent
for; but she was much surpris'd to
<P 42>
see them both enter the Room, and
(^Courtall^) looking on (^Crafty^) with an
angry Countenance, told him, he had
not dealt so friendly by him as he
imagin'd he would, since he had
brought him into a Place where a
Woman was. (^Crafty^) endeavour'd all
he could to excuse it, telling him,
'twas more than he knew that his
Wife was there, and that this was
the first time he ever saw her so
Officious before, and that he doubted
not but that she had more than
ordinary Reason, or she would not have
done it now.$]

   [$ (^Ariana^) began to suspect the
Intentions of (^Courtall^) , took such a fancy to
him for this his last Project, that she
only long'd for an opportunity to
make him sensible that she was no
ways hard-hearted to one who shew'd
her such Proofs of his Passion; in
short, she begg'd her Husbands Pardon
for being out of her Chamber, and
told him the excess of Joy that the 
News of his Welfare had giving her,
<P 43>
made her so over Officious in 
performing his Commands. She made
the Gentleman a low Curtesy, and
withal, unseen to old (^Crafty^) , cast him
such languishing Looks, that (^Courtall^)
took them for happy Presages of his
future good Fortune; but the old
Man seeing him stand in such an
Amaze, ask'd what ail'd him, who
immediately reply'd;$] Oh! Sir, just
so would my treacherous false Wife
flatter me, so would she Speak, and
Act, as tho' she were all Obedience;
but dear Friend (for so I am resolv'd
hereafter to call you) have a care
and be warn'd by me, they are Saints
in their Looks, but Devils in their
Hearts. Who would not think but
this Lady of yours was all 
Goodness and Honesty? When at the same
time, perhaps, her Heart is employ'd
in thinking of her Lover. [$ (^Ariana^)
having left them, stood at the Door,
and listned to all that they said, and
was much surpris'd to hear (^Courtall^)
speak to her jealous Husband in that
manner: She knew not at present how
<P 44>
to resent it.$] Sir, [$ (says the old Man) $]
I have taken a Course to prevent my
Wifes loving, for (although I doubt
not her Virtue) I have always so
strict an Eye over her, that since she
was mine, she has never been in the 
Company of any, but I have been by.
O happy Conduct! [$ (replies (^Courtall^) ) $]
Would I had taken that Course, I had
never been brought to the Misery you
see me in. But Sir, [$ (goes he on) $]
Heaven forbid that I should harbour
the least ill Thought of your Lady,
or raise in you a jealous Fear of your
Honour, for I believe if any Woman
can be Virtuous she is, all I alledge,
is that you cannot be too
circumspect; and that when once they have
their Liberty of going abroad, they
know not how to stay at home;
therefore as a Friend I advise you,
beware how you take her out with
you, lest sometime or other, tho' she
speak not by Words, she may make
shrewd Signs with her Eyes, and
they are such Bablers they'll soon
discover the Heart.
<P 45>
   [$ (^Crafty^) gave him Thanks for his
care of his Honour, and the Caution
he had given him for keeping his
Wife at home, took his leave of him,
and going out of the Chamber-door,
he sees his Wife, who had
overheard all, who accosted him in this
manner:$] No Wonder indeed [$ (said she) $]
that your Head is so full of
Chimera's and Jealousies, when you bring
Men into your House on purpose to
teach you: A fine Lesson indeed you
have heard, and no doubt but you'll
put it in Practice, that is to say, go
you abroad where you will and junket
and take your Pleasure, but let your
poor Wife be still kept at home:
But I have been ever Obedient unto
you, I will not begin now to
withstand your Commands, be they what
they will, you are my kind and
loving Husband, and so I'll Esteem you;
but let that Rake-hell, that Fire-brand
of the Devil, that Wind-mill pated
jealous Fool, who as he says, has lost
his Wife by his Folly, and I am apt
to believe it a Truth, let him I say,
<P 46>
be turn'd out of my Doors, and made
a laughing-stock to the World; or
at least so confin'd to his Lodge, that
I may never see him abroad, for I
have Vow'd him Revenge for what
I have heard.

   [$ (^Courtall^) seeing her Husbands Back
towards him, who was keeping his 
Wife from entring the Room to rail
at his Friend, made her so many Signs
of his Love, and stood in so
languishing a Posture, that (^Ariana^) , was
better satisfy'd now of his Wit than
before, cry'd out,$] Oh! That I had but
a Heart, 'tis all I would wish, you
shall never know how I'de use it.
[$ (^Crafty^) did all that he could to 
asswage her Passion, and in short told
her, he spoke nothing that he would
take notice of, and by his future
Conduct she should see, how void of
Jealousy or Suspicion his Heart was;
he intreated her Patience, and 
pretended he was an old Friend and
Acquaintance of his, and that for
Charity-sake he had releas'd him from his
<P 47>
Bonds, in which those who had robb'd
him of his Wife had left him: And
that when he had eas'd his Mind
and his Body, and gotten a little
Repast, he wou'd be more Temperate.$]
No Husband [$ (answer'd (^Ariana^) ) $] he has
some further Design than what he
pretends, and Heaven grant it be not
to make us both Miserable: I wish
it be not my Honour he seeks to
ensnare, and under the Cloak of 
becoming your Friend, would be your
greatest Enemy: I pray God he do
not do something to raise your 
Suspicion, and make you grow jealous of
me: I fear you have harbour'd a
Viper in your warm Bosom, who as 
soon as he shall recover Strength will
sting you to the Heart.

   [$ (^Crafty^) could not but Smile at his
Wife's Suggestions, and with a
Thousand fair Words and Promises he got
her to her Chamber, and call'd for 
(^Isabel^) her Maid to divert her with
singing, while he himself went down
<P 48>
to the Kitchen, where he made them
hasten a Supper for (^Courtall^) .$]

   [$ (^Ariana^) was mightily pleas'd to see
how they had both top'd the old 
Man, and knowing the Intrigue could
not be carried on without a Third
Person, first Swears (^Isabel^) to Secresy,
then tells her the whole Story, and
desired her Assistance, which she might
the easier afford her, since she lay in
a lower Room of the Lodge, and
since she was one to whom old
(^Crafty^) had long made an Amour. (^Isabel^)
was a Girl of a sprightly Wit, and
had a good Presence of Mind, promis'd
to be as Secret in the Affair as a deaf
Muse, and to give her all the
furtherance she was able. She told her
Mistress, if she would not be Jealous,
she would so order Matters, that she
would make the old Man so Blind
by his Love to her, that he should
see nothing else, and withal, if at
any time she should give him a 
meeting in Private, it should be only to
weedle his Gold from him, which
<P 49>
she doubted not but she should 
deserve for the good Offices she would
render her. (^Ariana^) was now so much
in Love with (^Courtall^) , that she
agreed to any thing to gain her Ends:
She not only promis'd not to be 
Jealous, but gave her free leave to use
her Husband as she thought fit for
her best Advantage, so she could
procure some way or other that Night
of procuring her the Sight of her
Lover. (^Isabel^) bid her leave it all to
her Management, and not trouble her
self any further. So while the old
Man was ordering Supper, (^Isabel^) goes 
to (^Courtall^) , and made him Happy in
the Hopes she gave him of that Night
enjoying as sweet and delicate a
Bedfellow as ever lay by Man's Side.$]

   [$She was just going out, when old
(^Crafty^) met her, and being in so
convenient a Place, could not forbear
giving her Twenty Kisses, which she
permitted with more Freedom than
formerly, and which so enflam'd the
old Man, that he proffer'd her a Purse
<P 50>
of Gold, would she consent to his
Love. (^Isabel^) made sure of the Gold,
and told him, that since he had daily
given her such bountiful Testimonies
of his Love, if he could any ways 
contrive to absent himself from his 
Wife, and come to her Chamber in 
the Lodge that Night, she should be
ready with open Arms to receive 
him.$]

   [$ (^Crafty^) was so transported with his 
Joy, that he promis'd not to fail,
tho' he ventred his Life in the
Adventure;$] there is no such hazzard,
[$replies (^Isabel^) ,$] you need only pretend you
are troubled with your old
Distemper the Gout, and cause a Bed to be
made for you in another Chamber,
seeming so kind to your Wife, as that
you would not disturb her Quiet.
My better Angel [$ (says (^Crafty^) giving
her a Kiss or Two,) when they were 
interrupted by the Servants who were
bringing in the Meat, they parted,
he with the Supper up to his Friend,
and (^Isabel^) to her Mistress, to give
<P 51>
her an account how the Business was
order'd.$]

   Alas! (^Isabel^) , [$ (says (^Ariana^) ) $] what
Comfort can accrue unto me of all
this? How shall I accomplish my
Designs, when the old Man is lying in
the very Room through which I must
pass, and who every Night locks you
up in your Chamber, and takes the
Key with him? No matter [$ (answers
(^Isabel^) ) $] we will do well enough for
that; do you pretend to be Ill, and
go to your Bed, and when he has
taken his good Night of you, slip
on my Night-gown and come down
to the Garden, and stand behind the
great Barbary-bush, where I will 
appoint him to meet me, so shall he
carry you in in my stead: Now that
he may have no Suspicion I will be
just behind the Door, so that as you
come in, slip out of his Hands, and
I will be ready to supply your Place:
I need not tell you then how easy 
'twill be for you to get to your 
Lover.
<P 52>
   [$In short all things were so manag'd,
that the old Man having taken his
leave of his Friend, and pretended the
Gout to his Wife, who seem'd to be 
as much troubled with a Pain in her 
Head, as he with a Pain in his Foot,
they both took their kind leave of
each other; when (^Isabel^) whispering
him as she went out, told him, she
would stay for him behind the great
Bush at the Entrance into the Lodge.
He was no sooner gone out of the
Chamber, But (^Ariana^) putting on her 
Maid's Night-gown, goes out with
her, where they seeing the old Man
come, separated, (^Isabel^) behind the
Porch of the Door, and (^Ariana^) behind
the Barbary-bush, where the old Man
coming, gave her more Gold, and
Twenty sweet Kisses, telling her in a
very low Voice, lest his Friend who
lay above should hear him, that there
were just Twenty Pieces. He charg'd
her for her Life not to speak a Word,$]
for, [$says he,$] there is a Friend of mine
who lies above Stairs, that I would
not for all I am worth should know
<P 53>
of our meeting; [^---^]
[^AS PLANNED, ISABEL AND ARIANA
CHANGED PLACES SO THAT THE LATTER COULD BE WITH HER
LOVER. HOWEVER, WHEN ARIANA WAS READY TO LEAVE SHE 
DISCOVERED THAT HER SLEEPING HUSBAND HAD HER BEDROOM 
KEY WITH HIM. SO ARIANA SOUGHT COURTALL'S HELP.^]
[^---^] [$at length she was forced to get up
Stairs again, and recount her 
Misfortune to (^Courtall^) , who remembring that
(^Crafty^) had told him a Story of (^Lilly's^)
<P 54>
erecting his Schemes, and taking his
Observations in that Lodge, turn'd it
to his Advantage, and putting his Head
out at the Window, (which by the
way was so streight he could not get
his Body out) he cry'd out so loud,$]
the Devil, the Devil, [$several times,
that it awak'd the old Man, who got
on his Cloaths as fast as he could,
and went up to see what was the 
matter;$] [^---^]
[^THE CRIES WOKE CRAFTY WHO, ON INVESTIGATING, FOUND THE TWO DRAPED 
IN BEDSHEETS AND MISTOOK THEM FOR GHOSTS. HE FLED TO THE MAIN HOUSE 
WITH THE TWO IN PURSUIT SO THAT ARIANA COULD GET TO HER OWN BED. 
MEANWHILE, ISABEL ASSUMED HER GHOSTLY ROLE AND RETURNED WITH COURTALL
TO THE LODGE.^]
<P 55>
   [$The Noise the old Man made waken'd
all the House, and (^Ariana^) being in
Bed call'd out to her Husband to come
to her help, which brought the good
Man into the Room, with a Light,
who ask'd her why she so loudly
call'd him:$] For nothing now, 
[$ (answer'd she) $] but I was dreaming that
your Friend, as you call him, 
knowing that I lay this Night alone, had
cunningly Stole into the House, and
was offering me Violence. No, no,
poor Man [$ (says (^Crafty^) ) $] he is in a most
lamentable Condition, for he has made
such an Out-cry of a Devil, that I
am raising my Servants to see what is
the matter. [$The Servants being all
ready and well Arm'd, took each a
Light in his Hand, and to the Lodge
<P 56>
they go, where they had no sooner
entred, but they heard (^Isabel^) under
the Bed-cloaths, crying,$] ah dear Devil,
forgive me this Fault, and I will
never commit the like again. [$The old
Man seeing her in this Agony, was
so much concern'd for her, that taking
the Cloaths off from her Face, he
us'd all the Arguments he could
invent to put her from her Fright;
which being perform'd, they ascended
the Stairs, and lifting up the Latch of
(^Courtall's^) Door, entred, where they
found him (as they imagin'd) in a
profound Sleep. (^Crafty^) went to him,
and waking him, demanded why he
made so hideous an Out-cry, who
answer'd him, if he made any, 'twas in
his Sleep, which he thank'd God, he
had taken very well.$] No, [$says the
old Man,$] nor did you see nothing
about a quarter of an Hour ago?
Not any thing, [$ (says he) $] for I was
so wearied and harrass'd with 
watching all the last Night, and my
Troubles had made me so heavy, that had
a Cannon been fir'd in my Chamber,
<P 57>
I believe it would hardly have wak'd
me. [$The old Man knew not what
to think of it, and being loath to
discover what he saw, for fear of
discomposing his Friend, took his leave
of him, and begg'd his Pardon for
disturbing his Rest, which he would
not in any case have done, had he
not fancy'd he heard him call out;
they bid one another most kindly good
Night. The old Man now began to
be asham'd of his Error, and he
believ'd, 'twas only his Guilt that had
made him fancy such a thing which
never had been; he kept the Secret
to himself, and return'd to his Wife's
Bed, telling her, that he had fancy'd
in his Sleep to have heard his Friend
call out, but it was all a Mistake;
however, it had cur'd him at present
of his Gout, for which he thought
his labour well bestow'd.$] Nay
Husband [$ (reply'd (^Ariana^) ) $] I have as much
cause to be thankful as you, for it
has quite taken away the Pain in
my Head. [$So they both turn'd their
Backs to each other most lovingly
<P 58>
like Man and Wife, and slept till
the Morning.$]

   [$It was Two or Three Days e're
the old Man could perfectly recover
the Fright, during which time (^Isabel^)
did all she could to confirm him in
an Opinion, that it was nothing but
his Brain which had Coin'd these
Chimera's; and she so well plaid her
Part, that the old Man became more 
Amorous than before, and solicited 
another Assignation; but (^Isabel^) to make
him more eager, pretended Twenty
Excuses, she told him her Conscience
had sorely accus'd her for what she
had done, and that should (^Ariana^) get
the least Intelligence of their Intreague,
she was ruin'd for ever. But the old
Man soon clear'd the Scruple in her
Conscience by more Gold, and told
her, his Wife was so loving, that she
would never suspect such a thing. In
short, another Assignation was made,
and (^Isabel^) to avoid all Suspicion, lest
any should see them in the Orchard
as they were entring together, had
<P 59>
procur'd of him the Key of the Lodge,
and promis'd to let him in at the
dead of the Night.$]

   [$ (^Courtall^) was made acquainted with 
the Design, and lay in a longing
Expectation for his Mistresses coming:
The old Man and his Wife made
their mutual Excuses, she was again
troubled with the Pain in her Head,
and he with the Gout in his Foot,
which now he pretended to Torture
him so much, that by no means would 
(^Ariana^) leave him till she saw him in
Bed, which no sooner was done but 
to (^Courtall^) she flies, and in less than
half an Hour the old Man was at
the Door, which (^Isabel^) had left a
jar for the purpose, he slips off his
Breeches and Night-gown, and to Bed 
he goes.$]

   [$ (^Courtall^) perswaded (^Ariana^) not to stir
till her Husband was gone, but she
calling to mind how the last time
when he was tir'd with his Solace
with (^Isabel^) , that he came to his own
<P 60>
Bed again, fearing the same might
happen now, she ventur'd to go down,
knowing the Door was left open;
but unluckily her Husband was awake,
and hearing something come softly
down Stairs, jogg'd (^Isabel^) , and ask'd
her if she heard nothing; she
answer'd him as half asleep half awake,
what should she hear? When (^Ariana^)
fell over a Stool that was left in the
middle of the Room; and the sudden
noise of the Fall so surpris'd her,
that she gave a loud Shriek; the old
Man knew it was her Voice, and 
was leaping out of Bed to have seiz'd
her, when (^Isabel^) catch'd fast hold of
his Neck, and clung so fast, that her
Mistress, without being seen, made her
escape to her own Chamber. (^Isabel^)
upbraided him with his whimsical
Fansies, and told him, she heard
nothing, and that for all the World she
would not admit his Embraces again.
(^Crafty^) took no notice of what she
said, but made all the hast he could
to his Wife's Chamber, who
pretended to be fast asleep. He knew not at
<P 61>
first whether he had best wake her
or no, till at length his Jealousy 
prevail'd, and he wak'd her with a
Thousand Reproaches for her having been
in (^Courtall's^) Chamber in the Lodge:
She for a while seem'd not to
understand what he meant, till he had plainly
open'd the matter; but she instead of
being surpris'd, told him,$] now Sir, see
that my Words the other Day are come
to pass, and this (^Courtall^) (as you
call him) has rais'd such Whimsies in
your Head, that I must never expect
one quiet Nights Rest so long as he
stays in the Lodge. Heaven knows
[$ (goes she on) $] I have not been out of
the Chamber since I came last to Bed;
[^---^]
[^ALTHOUGH ARIANA SATISFIED SOME OF CRAFTY'S SUSPICIONS, HE 
STAYED AWAKE AFTER MEETING ISABEL THE NEXT NIGHT. ON HEARING 
A NOISE, HE RAN OVER TO INVESTIGATE BUT WAS MET BY COURTALL 
WHO HUGGED HIM TIGHTLY SO THAT THE UNSEEN ARIANA MIGHT ESCAPE. 
HOWEVER, THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.^]
<P 62>
[^---^] [$ (^Isabel^) wak'd at the Noise, and taking
her Mistress by the Hand, made her
lie down in her Place in the Bed,
and lay her self upon her, so that
when the old Man, who by this time
found it was (^Courtall^) he had got, ask'd
him what made him to steal so softly
down Stairs?$] Why truly [$answer'd he,$]
not knowing you lay your self below
here, I heard a whispering, and
something else I need not Name, which
gave me the Curiosity to come down
<P 63>
and see who it was, little suspecting
it was my Friend, for I both thought 
you and your Wife lay in the upper
House. 'Tis very true [$answer'd the
old Man,$] tho' to Night it seems, we
lay both in this Lodge; therefore
Sir take it as you please, I must search
your Chamber; [$so without more ado,
running up Stairs, and seeing a glimpse
of Fire in the Chimney, he lights a
Candle, and diligently search'd all the
Room about, but finding No-body,
went down Stairs, and look'd under 
(^Isabel's^) Bed, and all about her
Chamber; at length (^Isabel^) ask'd him, what
'twas he look'd for, and desir'd to speak
with him; the old Man seeing the 
Doors and Windows fast, went to her
as she lay in Bed, her Mistress half
Dead with Fear under her;$] are you
not asham'd [$ (says she) $] to make my
Disgrace and your own so Publick?
For certainly this Man will bruit it
over all the Country, your Wife is 
safe enough, fear not, and 'tis only
your Jealousy which creates these false
Imaginations. [$ (^Crafty^) began to consider
<P 64>
what she told him, and was loath to
be found tardy himself by his Friend,
who had so rail'd at the
Misdemeanours of others: Up goes (^Crafty^) , and
begs him a Thousand Pardons, for
being in Bed below with his Wife,
(who says he is now in the Bed) $]
she would not let me rest till I had
got out of Bed; for says she, the
Man who so much you Esteem, and
think so Honest and Virtuous, has
only made his Excuse to get to this 
Lodge, where no doubt he has his
Concubine; forgive dear Friend [$ (goes
on the old Man) $] for I Name but her
Words, and Women you know when
once they harbour an ill Thought of
a Man, are as hard to be broke of it,
as when they love a Man, to be
debarr'd of Enjoyment. [$ (^Courtall^) told him,
he was sorry his Lady should harbour
such Thoughts of him, and tho' at his
first coming into the House she heard
their Discourse, yet could not but
wonder how he should so much merit
her Aversion,$] but [$says he,$] they will
have their Fagaries and Fancies let us
<P 65>
Men do or say what we will: You
are in the right indeed, dear Friend,
[$ (answers (^Crafty^) ) $] therefore I hope you'll
the sooner pardon this Fault: What
you have said and done, I forgive
with all my Heart, [$ (answers (^Courtall^) ) $]
but she I can never pardon, till she
ask it her self, or that she shews a
through Reconcilement [^SOURCE TEXT: Reconcilememt^] by accepting
my Bed, which is easier and fitter
for her than that where she is. [$The 
old Man was all this while in
nothing but his Shirt, and so was 
(^Courtall^) ; but hoping thereby to get the
old Man out of the Lodge, he Swore,
that unless they would accept of his
Bed, and let him rest in theirs, he
would not stay any longer in the
Lodge than he could put on his 
Cloaths. (^Crafty^) was at a stand, and
fearing (^Isabel^) and himself would be
discover'd, put out the Candle, 
telling him, since he was so resolute,
rather than be depriv'd of the Honour
of his good Company, he would
perswade his Wife to remove; but it
would not be seemly for her to 
<P 66>
appear in the Light: So going to (^Isabel^) ,
he takes her by the Hand, and says,$]
come my dear Wife, since my Friend
will be no otherwise satisfied for the
Affront we have done him, let us 
for an Hour or Two exchange Beds.
[$ (^Isabel^) gave the old Man half a
Dozen soft Kisses, which so inspir'd the
old Man with new Vigour, that he
thought it an Age while she was
getting up Stairs.$]

   [$ (^Courtall^) , who had perceiv'd (^Ariana^)
in the Bed, which made him so 
earnest to get (^Crafty^) away, leaps into
her Arms, and return'd the same
Compliment to his Wife, the old Man
was paying his Maid; but (^Ariana^)
taking the Key out of the old Man's
Breeches, which were still under the
Beds-head, softly unlocks the Door,
and goes to her own Chamber, 
ordering (^Courtall^) to lock the Door
after her, and put the Key where they
found it.$]

   [$She dress'd her self as fast as she
<P 67>
could, and calling up the Servants,
made them take Arms and Lights,
and go with her to the Lodge; where
she play'd such a hunt up, that she
frightned old (^Crafty^) out of his Wits
almost; she called to him at the 
Window, and bid him open the Gate,
or she would break it open: (^Courtall^) ,
by her Order, had fastned the Door
at the Stair-foot, so that 'twas
impossible for (^Crafty^) to get (^Isabel^) into
her Chamber: Wherefore (^Ariana^) making
the Gate of the Lodge be broke
open, enters with her Servants, and
unbolting the Stair-foot Door, leaving
her Servants below, takes a Candle in
her Hand, and goes into the
Chamber, where she found her Husband and
(^Isabel^) in their Shifts. The poor old
Man had nothing to say for himself,
but falling on his Knees, humbly begg'd
Pardon, and Vow'd ever after to give 
her her free Liberty.$] I wonder not
now [$ (says he) $] that you pretended so
much Kindness to (^Courtall^) , 'twas that
he might be the Pander to your loose
Desires. [$ (^Isabel^) fell on her Knees too,
<P 68>
and begg'd Pardon, but (^Ariana^) bid
her rise, telling her, she blam'd not
her so much to love a Man, whom
she thought all the World that saw
him must needs (as she her self did)
doat on him: Then with Tears 
falling down her Cheeks, she spake such
soft and tender things, that she
almost melted the old Man's Heart
into Tears, who promis'd her, would
she forgive him this Crime, he would 
ever hereafter be the most tender,
kind, and indulgent loving Husband
in the World; she should Command
Him and his Estate; she should wear
what Cloaths she pleas'd, have what
Jewels, and go where and when she
desired, and that for her Satisfaction,
he would give (^Isabel^) a piece of
Money to keep all Secret, and put her
away.$]

   No [$ (says (^Ariana^) ) $] (^Isabel^) shall still
keep the Place she has with me,
who, I know, had she not been 
overperswaded with your alluring Tongue,
and more powerful Gold, would
<P 69>
never have wrong'd so good a Mistress.
No, I'll be Sworn would I not
[$ (reply'd (^Isabel^) ) $] and Heaven knows this
is the first, and shall be the last time,
therefore dear Madam, if I may find
Favour in your Eyes, forgive us this
Fault, and my diligent Service and 
Fidelity hereafter shall demonstrate,
how sensible I am of my Offence, and
how careful I will be for the future,
of giving you the least Umbrage of
Suspicion. It is not but that I look
upon you (^Isabel^) [$ (reply'd (^Ariana^) ) $] 
equally Guilty with that ungrateful
Man; but I will keep you in my
Service, that you may be a perpetual
Memento to him of his Transgression:
So rise both, I do forgive you; [$so
sending away the Servants with an
Excuse, that she only came there
upon the Suspicion of Thieves, which
she mistook, and was only a
Gentleman of her Husband's Acquaintance,
who unknown to her, their Master
had lodg'd there: They being gone,
she whisper'd to (^Courtall^) to lie as
tho' he were in a Sound Sleep:$] [^---^]
