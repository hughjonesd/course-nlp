[}SCENE. 2.}]

   [$ (^Enter Menechmus talking backe to his
wife within.^) $]

If ye were not such a brabling foole and
mad-braine scold as yee are, yee would
neuer thus crosse your husbande in all
actions. Tis no matter, let her serue me
thus once more, Ile send her home to
her dad with a vengeance. I can neuer
go foorth a doores, but shee asketh mee
whither I go? what I do? what busines?
what I fetch? what I carry? * As though she were a 
Constable, or a tollgatherer. I haue pamperd her too much: she
hath seruants about her, wooll, flax, and all things necessary
to busie her withall, yet she watcheth & wondreth whither
I go. Well sith it is so, she shall now haue some cause, I mean
to dine this day abroad with a sweet friend of mine.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Yea mary now comes hee to the point that prickes
me: this last speech gaules mee as much as it would doo his
wife; If he dine not at home, I am drest.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] We that haue Loues abroad, and wiues at home, 
are miserably hampred, yet would euery man could tame his
shrewe as well as I doo mine. I haue now filcht away a fine
ryding cloake of my wiues, which I meane to bestow vpon
one that I loue better. Nay, if she be so warie and watchfull
ouer me, I count it an almes deed to deceiue her.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Come, what share haue I in that same?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Out alas, I am taken.
<P B1R>
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] True, but by your friend.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] What, mine owne (^Peniculus^) ?
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Yours (ifaith) bodie and goods if I had any.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Why thou hast a bodie.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Yea, but neither goods nor good bodie.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Thou couldst neuer come fitter in all thy life.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Tush, I euer do so to my friends, I know how to    #
come
alwaies in the nicke. Where dine ye to day?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Ile tell thee of a notable pranke.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] What did the Cooke marre your meate in the 
dressing? Would I might see the reuersion.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Tell me didst thou see a picture, how (^Iupiters^) #
Eagle 
snatcht away (^Ganimede^) , or how (^Venus^) stole away (^Adonis^) .
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Often, but what care I for shadowes, I want        #
substance.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Looke thee here, looke not I like such a picture?
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] O ho, what cloake haue ye got here?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Prethee say I am now a braue fellow.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] But hearke ye, where shall we dine?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Tush, say as I bid thee man.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Out of doubt ye are a fine man.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] What? canst adde nothing of thine owne?
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Ye are a most pleasant Gentleman.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] On yet.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Nay not a word more, vnlesse ye tell mee how you 
and your wife be fallen out.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Nay I haue a greater secret then that to impart to
thee.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Say your minde.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Come farther this way from my house.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] So, let me heare.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Nay farther yet.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] I warrant ye man.
   [$ (^* Men.^) $] Nay yet farther.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Tis pittie ye were not made a water-man to row in  
a wherry.
<P B1V>
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Why?
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Because ye go one way, and looke an other, stil    #
least 
your wife should follow ye. But what's the matter, Ist not 
almost dinner time?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Seest thou this cloake?
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Not yet. Well what of it?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] This same I meane to giue to (^Erotium^) .
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] That's well, but what of all this?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] There I meane to haue a delicious dinner prepard
for her and me.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] And me?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] And thee.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] O sweet word. What, shall I knock presently at her 
doore?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] I knocke. But staie too (^Peniculus^) , let's not  #
be too
rash. Oh see shee is in good time comming forth.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Ah, he now lookes against the Sun, how her beames 
dazell his eyes.
[$Enter (^Erotium.^) $]
   [$ (^Eroti.^) $] What mine owne (^Menechmus^) , welcome sweete
heart.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] And what am I, welcome too?
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] You sir? ye are out of the number of my welcome
guests.
   [$ (^* Pen.^) $] I am like a voluntary souldier, out of paie.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] (^Erotium^) , I haue determined that here shal be  #
pitcht 
a field this day; we meane to drinke for the heauens: And
which of vs performes the brauest seruice at his weopon the
wine boll, your selfe as Captaine shall paie him his wages 
according to his deserts.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Agreed.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] I would we had the weapons, for my valour pricks
me to the battaile.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Shall I tell thee sweete mouse? I neuer looke vpon
thee, but I am quite out of loue with my wife.
   [$ (^Eroti.^) $] Yet yee cannot chuse, but yee must still weare
<P B2R>
something of hers: whats this same?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] This? such a spoyle (sweete heart) as I tooke from
her to put on thee.
   [$ (^Ero.^) $] Mine owne (^Menechmus^) , well woorthie to bee my
deare, of all dearest.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Now she showes her selfe in her likenesse, when shee
findes him in the giuing vaine, she drawes close to him.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] I thinke (^Hercules^) got not the garter from      
(^Hypolita^) so hardly, as I got this from my wife. Take this, and   #
with
the same, take my heart.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Thus they must do that are right Louers: especially
if they meane to beggers with any speed.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] I bought this same of late for my wife, it stood mee
(I thinke) in some ten pound
   [$ (^Penicu.^) $] There's tenne pounde bestowed verie 
thriftily.
   [$ (^Menechmus.^) $] But knowe yee what I woulde haue yee 
doo?
   [$ (^Erotium^) $] It shall bee done, your dinner shall be 
readie.
   [$ (^* Men.^) $] Let a good dinner be made for vs three. Harke
ye, some oysters, a mary-bone pie or two, some artichockes,
and potato rootes, let our other dishes be as you please.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] You shall sir.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] I haue a litle businesse in this Cittie, by that   #
time
dinner will be prepared. Farewell till then, sweete (^Erotium^) :
Come (^Peniculus^) .
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Nay I meane to follow yee: I will sooner leese my 
life, then fight of you till this dinner be done.
   [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
   [$ (^Erotium.^) $] Who's there? Call mee (^Cylindrus^) the Cooke
hither.

[$ (^Enter Cylindrus.^) $]

(^Cylindrus^) , take the Hand-basket, and heere, there's
<P B2V>
ten shillings is there not?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Tis so mistresse.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Buy mee of all the daintiest meates ye can get, ye
know what I meane: so as three may dine passing well, and
yet no more then inough.
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] What guests haue ye to day mistresse?
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Here will be (^Menechmus^) and his Parasite, and my
selfe.
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] That's ten persons in all.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] How many?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Ten, for I warrant you, that Parasite may stand for
eight at his vittels.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Go dispatch as I bid you, and looke ye returne with
all speed.
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] I will haue all readie with a trice.
[$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
[}ACT. 2. SCEN. 1.}]
[$Enter (^Menechmus^) , (^Sosicles^) . (^Messenio^) his seruant,
and some Saylers.$]

   [$ (^Men.^) $] Surely (^Messenio^) , I thinke Sea-fairers neuer   #
take
so comfortable a ioy in any thing, as when they haue
bene long tost and turmoylde in the wide seas, they hap at
last to ken land.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Ile be sworn, I shuld not be gladder to see a whole
Country of mine owne, then I haue bene at such a sight. But
I pray, wherfore are we now come to (^Epidamnum^) ? must we
needs go to see euerie Towne that we heare off?
   [$ (^Menech.^) $] Till I finde my brother, all Townes are alike to
me: I must trie in all places.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Why then let's euen as long as wee liue seeke your
brother: six yeares now haue we roamde about thus, (^Istria,
Hispania, Massylia, Ilyria^) , all the vpper sea, all high           #
(^Greece^) ,
all Hauen Towns in (^Italy^) , I think if we had sought a needle
all this time, we must needs haue found it, had it bene aboue
ground. It cannot be that he is aliue, and to seek a dead man
<P B3R>
thus among the liuing: what folly is it?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Yea, could I but once find any man that could
certainly enforme me of his death, I were satisfied; otherwise
I can neuer desist seeking: Litle knowest thou (^Messenio^) how
neare my heart it goes.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] This is washing of a Blackamore. Faith let's goe
home, vnlesse ye meane we should write a storie of our
trauaile.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Sirra, no more of these sawcie speeches, I         #
perceiue I
much teach ye how to serue me, not to rule me.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] I, so, now it appeares what it is to be a         #
seruant. Wel
yet I must speake my conscience. Do ye heare sir? Faith I
must tell ye one thing, when I looke into the leane estate of
your purse, and consider aduisedly of your decaying stocke,
I hold it verie needfull to be drawing homeward, lest in
looking your brother, we quite lose our selues. For this assure
your selfe, this Towne (^Epidamnum^) , is a place of outragious
expences, exceeding in all ryot and lasciuiousnesse: and (I
heare) as full of Ribaulds, Parasites, Drunkards, Catchpoles,
Cony-catchers, and Sycophants, as it can hold: then for
Curtizans, why here's the currantest stamp of them in the world.
Ye must not thinke here to scape with as light cost as in
other places. The verie name shews the nature, no man comes 
hither (^ (\sine damno\) ^) .
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Yee say very well indeed: giue mee my purse into
mine owne keeping, because I will so be the safer, (^ (\sine         #
damno\) ^) .
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Why sir?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Because I feare you wil be busie among the 
[^SOURCE TEXT: among the the^] 
Curtizans, & so be cosened of it: then should I take great paines
in belabouring your shoulders, so to auoid both these harms,
Ile keep it my selfe.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] I pray do so sir, all the better.
[$Enter (^Cylindrus^) .$]
* I haue tickling geare here yfaith for their dinners: It 
grieues me to the heart to think how that cormorant knaue
(^Peniculus^) must haue his share in these daintie morsels But
<P B3V>
what? Is (^Menechmus^) come alreadie, before I could come
from the Market? (^Menechmus^) how do ye sir? how haps it
ye come so soone?
   [$ (^Menech.^) $] God a mercy my good friend, doest thou know
mee?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Know ye? no not I. Where's mouldichappes that 
must dine with ye? A murrin on his manners.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Whom meanest thou good fellow?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Why (^Peniculus^) worship, that whorson            #
lick-trencher,
your Parasiticall attendant.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] What (^Peniculus^) ? what attendant? My Attendant?
Surely this fellow is mad.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Did not I tell ye what cony-catching villaines yee
should finde here?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] (^Menechmus^) , harke ye sir, ye come too soone    #
backe
again to dinner, I am but returned from the Market.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Fellow, here thou shalt haue money of me, goe get
the priest to sacrifice for thee. I know thou art mad, els thou
wouldst neuer vse a straunger thus?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Alas sir, (^Cylindrus^) was wont to be no stranger #
to you,
know ye not (^Cylindrus^) ?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] (^Cylindrus^) , or (^Coliendrus^) , or what the    #
diuell thou art,
I know not, neither do I care to know.
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] I know you to be (^Menechmus^) .
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Thou shouldst be in thy wits, in that thou namest
me so right, but tell me, where hast thou knowne me?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Where? euen heere, where ye first fell in loue with
my mistresse (^Erotium^) .
   [$ (^Men.^) $] I neither haue Louer, neither knowe I who thou
art.
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Know ye not who I am? who fils your cup &
dresses your meate at our house?
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] What a slaue is this? that I had somewhat to breake
the Rascals pate withall.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] At your house, when as I neuer came in (^Epidamnum^)
till this day.
<P B4R>
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Oh thats true. Do ye not dwell in yonder house?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Foule shame light vpon them that dwell there, for
my part.
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Questionlesse, hee is mad indeede, to curse himselfe
thus. Harke ye (^Menechmus^) .
   [$ (^Men.^) $] What saist thou?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] If I may aduise ye, ye shall bestow this money which
ye offred me, vpon a sacrifice for your selfe: for out of doubt
you are mad that curse your selfe.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] What a verlet art thou to trouble vs thus?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Tush he wil many times iest with me thus. Yet when
his wife is not by, tis a ridiculous iest.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] VVhat's that?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] This I say, Thinke ye I haue brought meate inough
for three of you? If not, ile fetche more for you and your
wench, and snatchcrust your Parasite.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] VVhat wenches? what Parasites?
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Villaine, Ile make thee tell me what thou meanest
by all this talke?
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] Away Iack Napes, I say nothing to thee, for I know
thee not, I speake to him that I know.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Out drunken foole, without doubt thou art out of
thy wits.
   [$ (^Cyl.^) $] That you shall see by the dressing of your meat. Go,
go, ye were better to go in and finde somewhat to do there,
whiles your dinner is making readie. Ile tell my mistresse ye
be here.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Is he gone? (^Messenio^) I think vppon thy words
alreadie.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Tush marke I pray, Ile laie fortie pound here dwels
some Curtizan to whom this fellow belong.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] But (^I^) wonder how he knowes my name.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Oh ile tell yee. These Courtizans assoone as anie
straunge shippe arriueth at the Hauen, they sende a boye
or a wench to enquire what they be, what their names be,
whence they come, wherefore they come, &c. If they can by
<P B4V>
any meanes strike acquaintance with him, or allure him to
their houses, he is their owne. We are here in a tickle place
maister, tis best to be circumspect.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] I mislike not thy counsaile (^Messenio^) .
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] I, but follow it then. Soft, here comes somebodie
forth. Here sirs, Marriners, keep this same amongst you.
[$Enter (^Erotium^) .$]
   Let the doore stand so, away, it shall not be shut. Make
hast within there ho: maydes looke that all things be readie.
Couer the boord, put fire vnder the perfuming pannes, let all
things be very handsome. Where is hee, that (^Cylindrus^) sayd
stood without here? Oh, what meane you sweet heart, that
ye come not in? I trust you thinke your selfe more welcome
to this house then to your owne, and great reason why you
should do so. Your dinner & all things are readie as you
willed. Will ye go sit downe?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Whom doth this woman speake to?
   [$ (^Ero.^) $] Euen to you sir, to whom else should I speake?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Gentlewoman ye are a straunger to me, and I
maruell at your speeches.
   [$ (^Ero.^) $] Yea sir, but such a straunger, as I acknowledge ye #
for
my best and dearest friend, and well you haue deserued it.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Surely (^Messenio^) , this woman is also mad or    #
drunke,
that vseth all this kindnesse to mee vppon so small
acquaintance.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Tush, did not I tell ye right? these be but leaues
which fall vpon you now, in comparison of the trees that wil
tumble on your necke shortly. I tolde ye, here were siluer
tong'de hacsters. But let me talke with her a litle. 
Gentlewoman what acquaintance haue you with this man? where
haue you seene him?
   [$ (^Ero.^) $] Where he sawe me, here in (^Epidamnum^) .
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] In (^Epidamnum^) ? who neuer till this day set    #
his foote
within the Towne.
   [$ (^Ero.^) $] Go, go, flowting Iack. (^Menechmus^) what need al  #
this?
I pray go in.
<P C1R>
   [$ (^Men.^) $] She also calls me by my name.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] She smels your purse.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] (^Messenio^) come hither, here take my purse. Ile  #
know
whether she aime at me or my purse, ere I go.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Will ye go in, to dinner sir?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] A good motion, yea and thanks with all my heart.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Neuer thanke me for that which you commaunded
to be prouided for your selfe.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] That I commaunded?
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Yea, for you and your Parasite.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] My Parasite?
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] (^Peniculus^) , who came with you this morning when
you brought me the cloake which you got from your wife.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] A cloake that I brought you, which I got from my
wife?
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Tush what needeth all this iesting? Pray leaue off.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Iest or earnest, this I tell ye for a truth. I     #
neuer had
wife, neither haue I, nor neuer was in this place till this
instant: for only thus farre am I come, since I brake my fast in
the ship.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] What ship do ye tell me off?
   [$ (^* Mess.^) $] Marry ile tell ye, an old rotten weather-beaten
ship, that we haue saild vp and downe in this sixe yeares, Ist
not time to be going homewards thinke ye?
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Come, come, (^Menechmus^) , I pray leaue this     #
sporting
and go in.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Well Gentlewoman, the truth is, you mistake my
person, it is some other that you looke for.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] Why, thinke ye I know ye not to be (^Menechmus^) ,
the sonne of (^Moschus^) , and haue heard ye say, ye were borne
at (^Syracusis^) , where (^Agathocles^) did raigne, then             #
(^Pythia^) , then
(^Liparo^) , and now (^Hiero^) .
   [$ (^Men.^) $] All this is true.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Either shee is a witch, or else shee hath dwelt   #
there
and knew ye there.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Ile goe in with her (^Messenio^) , Ile see further #
of this matter.
<P C1V>
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Ye are cast away then.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Why so? I warrant thee. I can loose nothing,
somwhat I shall gaine, perhaps a good lodging during my abode
heere. Ile dissemble with her an other while. Nowe when
you please let vs go in, I made straunge with you, because
of this fellow here, least he should tell my wife of the cloake
which I gaue you.
   [$ (^Ero.^) $] Will ye staie any longer for your (^Peniculus^) your
Parasite?
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Not I, Ile neither staie for him, nor haue him let
come in, if he do come.
   [$ (^Erot.^) $] All the better. But sir, will yee doo one thing for
me.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] What is that?
   [$ (^Ero.^) $] To beare that cloake which you gaue me, to the
Diars, to haue it new trimd and altred.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Yea that will be well, so my wife shall not know it.
Let mee haue it with mee after dinner. I will but speake a 
word or two with this fellowe, then ile follow yee in. Ho
(^Messenio^) come aside: goe and prouide for thy selfe, and these
shipboyes in some Inne, then looke that after dinner you
come hither for me.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Ah maister will yee be conycatcht thus 
wilfully.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Peace foolish knaue, seest thou not what a sot she
is, I shall coozen her I warrant thee.
   [$ (^Mess.^) $] Ay maister.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Wilt thou be gone?
   [$ (^* Mess.^) $] See, see, she hath him safe inough now. Thus
he hath escaped a hundreth Pyrates hands at sea: and now
one land-rouer hath bourded him at first encounter. Come
away fellowes.
<P C2R>

[}ACT. 3.}]

[$Enter (^Peniculus.^) $]

* Twentie yeares I thinke and more, haue I playde
the knaue, yet neuer playd I the foolish knaue as I
haue done this morning. I follow (^Menechmus^) , and he goes
to the Hall where now the Sessions are holden: there
thrusting our selues into the prease of people, when I was in
midst of all the throng, he gaue me the slip, that I could
neuer more set eye on him, and I dare sweare, came directly
to dinner. That I would he that first deuised these Sessions
were hang'd, and all that euer came of him: tis such a
hinderance to men that haue belly businesses in hand. If a man be
not there at his call, they amearce him with a vengeance.
Men that haue nothing else to do, that do neither bid anie
man, nor are themselues bidden to dinner, such should come
to Sessions, not we that haue these matters to looke too. If it
were so, I had not thus lost my dinner this day: which I think
in my conscience he did euen purposely couzen me off. Yet
I meane to go see: if I can but light vppon the reuersion, I
may perhaps get my peny-worthes. But how now? is this
(^Menechmus^) comming away from thence? dinner done, and
all dispacht? what execrable lucke haue I?
[$Enter (^Menechmus^) the trauailer.$]
   Tush I warrant ye, it shall be done as ye would wish, Ile
haue it so altered and trimd anew, that it shall by no meanes
be knowne againe.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] He carries the cloake to the Dyars, dinner done, the
wine drunke vp, the Parasite shut out of doores. Well, let me
liue no longer, but ile reuenge this iniurious mockerie. But

   [$ (^Men.^) $] Good goddes, who euer had such lucke as I? Such
cheare, such a dinner, such kinde entertainment? And for a
farewell, this cloake which I meane shall go with me.

I am sure he is now flowting at me for the losse of my 
dinner.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] She tels me how I gaue it her, and stole it from my
wife. When I perceiued she was in an error, though I knew
not how, I began to sooth her, and to say euery thing as she
said. Meane while I far'd well, and that a free cost.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Well, I'le go talke with him.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] Who is this same that comes to me?
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] O well met fickle-braine, false and treacherous

you should so giue me the slip, come before and dispatch the
dinner, deale so badly with him that hath reuerenst ye like a

these, I warrant her, ile make the best hand I can of them. Is
she gone? Doo not all the gods conspire to loade mee with
good lucke? well I see tis high time to get mee out of these

   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Oh sir, this is an other matter, touch him in the
former cause.

from me, when you haue done, come forth brauely in your

Hall, I neuer returned till this very instant, as you two met
me.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] Go too, go too, I know ye well inough. Did ye think
I would not cry quittance with you, yes faith, I haue tolde
your wife all.

cause of my griefe, and what he hath told me. I say my cloake
is stolne from me.
   [$ (^Men.^) $] My cloake is stolne from me?

her.

farewell.
   [$ (^Pen.^) $] God a mercy for nothing, that can neuer be, for    #

But I durst laie a wager, I can gesse neare the matter: I
suppose it is some brabble between her husband and her. These
yoong women that bring great dowries to their husbands,
are so masterfull and obstinate, that they will haue their own

him. And (^Erotium^) shee sheweth plainly what she is: who
because I require the cloake again to carrie to my wife, saith
I gaue it her, and flatly falles out with me. How

He called his wife bitch, and all to nought.

ouer me here with a Chariot and horses, and to kill mee, and
teare me in peeces. This thou didst, (^I^) know what I say.

thou hast kild thy father, and beaten thy mother. Doo ye

this? These men say I am mad, who without doubt are mad
themselues. I stirre not, I fight not, (^I^) am not sicke. I speake
to them, I know them. Well what were I now best to do? I
would goe home, but my wife shuttes me foorth a doores.

ribbes and shoulders, as for his belly and throate. When I
think vpon the rewards of a sluggard, I am euer pricked with
a carefull regard of my backe and shoulders: for in truth I
haue no fancie to these blows, as many a one hath: methinks
it is no pleasure to a man to be basted with a ropes end two
or three houres togither. I haue prouided yonder in the 
Towne, for all our marriners, and safely bestowed all my
