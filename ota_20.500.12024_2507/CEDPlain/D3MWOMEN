[}WOMEN WILL HAVE THEIR WILL:

   [$ (^Mistris New-come.^) $]
How doe you good Mistris (^Custome^) ? I
made bold to give you a visit, to see how
you doe.
   [$ (^Mistris Custome.^) $] M. New-come, pray draw
neare and sit downe; come, you are heartily,
heartily welcome.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] I shall be a trouble to you, I see you 
are busie.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] No, no, not so busie, but I can spare so 
much time as to discourse with you a while; how 
doth your husband doe? what, is he at home? or 
where is his Rendezvouz?                                             
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] I thank you Mistris (^Custome^) ; he is
not at home, nor is his Rendezvouz farre from
home; but what, have you a Feast here
suddenly, that you are so Decking, Adorning, &
Trimming up your house with this fine Rosemary
and Bayes? I beleeve there is some such doings,
is there not?
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] No truely, here is no Feasting, but
what doth fall out according to the Time.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Time; pray now what Time?
<P 3>
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Why, (^Christmas^) , woman; have you
forgot it? Indeed these Wars and Jars would almost
make one forget their Christen name, if they were
not often called on, to put one in remembrance.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Indeed (^Christmas^) can hardly be
beaten out of many folks heads, which is a very
strange thing.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Not so strange as true, woman; I
should rather, and sooner forget my mother that
bare me, and the paps that gave me suck, then
forget this merry Time; nay, if thou hadst ever seen
the Mirth and Jolitie that we have had at those
Times when I was young, thou wouldst blesse thy
selfe to see it.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Nay, undoubtedly I might very well
beleeve you without swearing; for surely, there
was then excessive Sports, Pastimes, & Revels,
that it would make a bodies haire stand an end
to heare and see it.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Didst thou never heare of my
Grand-father? why, he was second cousin to the Earle of
(^Dum-belly^) , Cup-bearer to (^Bacchus^) , Knight of the
Vapour, and Esquire of the Pipe; he was a great
Polititian, Monopolist, and Project-monger; 'tis
very strange you never heard of him.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] I have heard of the like, if not the
same; but what of him?
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] What of him; nay, nothing of him,
but I say my Grand-father was his second cousin.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Well, and what of that?
<P 4>
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] What of that? Nay, by the masse, I
forgot where I was; this 'tis to have such a scurvy
head-piece, by Lady I know not what I was going
to say.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] It was about your Grand-father at
(^Christmas^) .
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] O me, O me, 'tis true, 'tis true; I see you
keep your brains warmer then I doe, which makes
you so ripe-witted: but for feare I should forget
againe, Ile tell thee; my Grand-father kept a brave
house at (^Christmas^) , (it makes ones teeth dance in
ones head like Virginal-Jacks with the very
conceit on't) for according to his owne Verses:)
[^VERSE OMITTED.^]
   This I say, the very conceit of this is enough to
make one chew the Cud; for my part, it makes
me methinks look two yeares younger then I did
before, every time I think on't; indeed they were
brave Times, pray God send us such again, and we
shall once more have a merry world.
<P 5>
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] This was in the times of old, when
men wore trunck-Hose.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Nay, by Lady (God forgive me for
swearing) it is not so long since; for my father
kept a brave house to at that Time, though he
pinched for it all the yeare after; he had all the
Varieties as the earth could afford, for Boyled,
Baked, and Roasted.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] I have seen but a little of this Sport,
yet of that little I have seen too much; for it
would make the stander by ashamed to see what
the feeder devoures, and what gods they make
of their bellies, that one would think that people
did take in twelve moneths Provision into their
panches, or that they did ballast their bellies for
a voyage to (^Constantinople^) , or to the (^East-Indies^) .
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Indeed all this as you speake is true;
for I think verily, if it were not for Dancing,
Frisking, Playing, Toying, Christmas-Gamboles [^Christmas IN ITALICS #
IN SOURCE TEXT^] , and
such kind of jogging Exercises to shake it down,
it were impossible they should devoure so much
as they do. Then to see Cook hot and Cook cold,
Cook young and Cook old, Scullion & Scullions
mate, all in a sweat, like so many Monarchs of the
Marrow-bones,Marquesses of the Mutton,
Princes of the Pyes and Pasties, Lords, High-Regents
of the Spits and Kittles, Barons of the Griddiron,
and so be Commanders of the Frying-pannes
during this Festivall. I say, to see them Act their
Tragi-comicall Feasts, would make a man or
<P 6>
womans stomacke elevate its selfe into another
temper.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] And all this hurly-burly is for no
other purpose but to stop the greedy mouth of this
(^Leviathan^) , or Land-whale, (^Christmas^) .
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Well, 'tis true; but now forsooth
(^Christmas^) must be cryed downe, (^Reformation^) must be
cryed up; if they were weighed in a ballance, then
I know (^Christmas^) would goe downe without
crying: but there are some now adayes, a Crew of
Tatter-demallians, amongst which the best could
scarce ever attain to a Calves-skin-Sute, or a piece
of Neck-Beefe and Carrets to dinner on a Sunday,
or scarcely ever mounted (before these times) to
any Office above the degree of Scavenger or
Tything-man at the farthest; and now forsooth these
Reformado's, upon pretence of Reformation,
shall destroy and overthrow the most Famous and
Commendable Customes of this Land; especially
for the observing and keeping of this Great Day:
what, are we forsooth wiser then our fathers, that
brought us up, and educated us in this Wisedom?
'Tis a strange thing to me; it can't be beaten
into my braines, that this can be just and honest.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] (^M. Custome^) , you were best to discourse
with some of these which thinke it not fitting to
keep that Time in such a Revelling way,
perhaps and no doubt but they will give you reasons
against it; & I partly know you to be a rationall
woman, and that you will permit reason to bear
the sway.
<P 7>
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Reason, reason; as if any man could
shew a reason for not keeping of (^Christmas^) , you
spake as bad as blasphemie: (^Christmas^) , that hath
been a Custome ever since the world began, should
now with a puffe of reason, through the
Ramshorne of selfe-conceit, with the walls of (^Jericho^) ,
be layd flat to the ground.    
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Nay, (^M. Custome^) , although it is a
Custome very Ancient, yet it is not so old as the
world; there you are somewhat mistaken.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] As for the world, I doe not know its
age; but for (^Christmas^) , I am sure it was kept in my
Grand-fathers great Grand-fathers time, in my
Grand-fathers time, & in my fathers time, & none
of these did ever think it Superstition or Idolatry;
and for my part, I will keep it as long as I am able,
let all the powers on earth stand to oppose it.
[^VERSE OMITTED.^]
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Then you are resolved.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] I am for that matter, come what will
come; ah now (methinkes) my braines are whet
upon the conceit on't; I could wish now at this
Time, that the Valiantest Champion of all the
<P 8>
Round-headed Disputants, to encounter with me
in this Argument: I tell thee, If I had the tongue
of (^Hermes^) , who (as my Husband saith) was
Prolocutor to the gods; or if I had as many fingers
as (^Camaldus^) , who was feigned to have an hundred
hands. If surging (^Neptune^) , was converted into
Inke, or the rugged-ragged-face of our antient
mother (^Tellus^) , were Paper, yet could not the
verball, volubilitie, or elocution of my voyce, nor the
agilitie, dexteritie, or facultie of my hands, nor the
spacious, unmesurable number-lesse, white
innocent Paper; no, none of all these could either speak,
write, or by any other meanes declare the
aboundance of Arguments, comprehended within the
notion of my braine for this unlimited Subject.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] For my part, your Eloquence is
too harsh for me.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Oh, I have it by heart; I have heard
my Husband, when Gentlemen have been
drinking here at my house, rabble out aboundance of
this Fustian-stuffe, which gives them a great deale
of content, especially when they have almost seen
the Devill in a Prize Jerkin, and every thing look
with (^Janus^) faces.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Then I perceive by you that you
cannot possibly be wrought on to leave this Old
Ceremony, your mind is so unchangeable.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Unchangeable, can the Black-moore
change his skin, or the Sunne alter his continued
course? Yet sooner can these things be done then
<P 9>
my mind changed, for to keep old (^Christmas^) once
again.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] It is an old saying, and true, That
which is bred in the bone, will seldome or never
out of the flesh.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Thou sayest true; My great
Grand-father, my Grand-father, my father, and now my
selfe, these nine and fortie yeares have kept this
Festivall Time, and this yeare above all the rest
ought to be kept, for it is the yeare of (^Iubile^) , as
the Bishop of (^Armagh^) said, when he preached
before the King; and I for my part am fourescore
and one yeares old: So that here is (^Iubile^) upon
(^Iubile^) , yeare-Iubile [^Iubile IN ITALICS IN SOURCE TEXT^] for   #
my birth, and the year
(^Iubile^) for my keeping (^Christmas^) : and therefore shall
not we be merry mine owne S. (^Nichol.^) a (^Cod^) ?
(^We will be merry, let all say what they will,
As we have kept it, so wee'l keepe it still.^)
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] What, will you keepe it in spite of
Authoritie?
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] What Authoritie? I am sure my
father and mother had the greatest authoritie over
me ever since I was borne, and other authoritie I
knew none before I was married, & now it seems
I am under a crabbed Husbands authoritie, and
besides him I will be subject to none, and I am sure
he is as strong for (^Christmas^) as the greatest of our
Ancestours; and therefore that Authoritie will
not curb me.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Then it seemes you know no other
authoritie?
<P 10>
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] No by our Lady, not I: neither doe I
desire to know any, for he is crabbed enough of
any conscience; if I should tell you all, you would
say so too: therefore the Devill take all other
Authority, if it be no better then a dogged,
crosse-graine Devillish Husband.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Why, then you count the
Parliament no Authoritie?
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] I hope Gossip you are not come to pick
quarrells with me in my owne house?
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] No truely (^M. Custome^) , not I, neither
would I have you to entertaine such a hard
conceit; for my part I was never so well read in
such Principles, nor ever took any degree at the
Universitie of (^Billingsgate^) .
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Perhaps you are of your mothers
tutor-age then, for I am sure she was an
Oyster-woman of that Colledge for one and twentie yeares,
to my owne knowledge; and had her tongue as
nimble as an (^Italian^) Mountebanck.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] What my mother was, is nothing to
me.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] But you are a Chip of the Old Block:
for what doe you mean, in telling me of the
Parliament?
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] I meane the two Houses of
Parliament which have jumped together in one
Opinion, for the putting downe and destroying of this
(^Romish^) Beast (^Christmas^) ; for which, they are to
be commended.
<P 11>
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] It is a strange thing; let the Devill
never so cunningly hide his head, we shall know
him by his Cloven foot; nor let the Asse never
so craftily hide his feet, yet we may know him by
his Eares: and howsoever covertly you have
carried your selfe, I know you, both by head & heels:
I see you are one of the New Faction, and a great
Student in (^Spittle-Colledge^) ; but that is nothing
to me: yet what do you mean by Calling
(^Christmas^) a (^Romish^) Beast? pray explain your self at large.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] To leave all manner of
Circumstance, which is not pertinent to our Subject in
hand --
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] By Lady neighbour, I think you are
one of these New Teachers, you handle your
matter so excellent; but I trouble you, pray proceed.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] The word ( (^Christmas^) ) if learnedly
weighed in it we shall find matter of dangerous
Consequence: As,
   1. If we consider what the word or name is,
(^Christ^) .
   2. If we consider who gave him this name.
   3. Where he was Christned, or had the name
given him.
   4. By what authoritie they gave him this name.
   Of which I shall proceed in order, according to
my weak abilitie: And first for the word;
(^Christmas^) is a word which deciphers a Scorpion, which
is a venomous Beast, which carries a sting at
his tayle, and so doth (^Christmas^) ; for the word
<P 12>
(^Masse^) is a sting in the tayle of that (^Romish^)
Beast: Secondly, we must consider who gave
him this name, & that was his God-fathers and
God-mothers in Baptisme; from whense ariseth
this doubtfull question? who they were, and that
was Pope (^Boniface^) , Pope (^Fireface^) , and Pope
(^Joane^) ; but by reason of their non-residence here
in (^England^) , the Bishops took that office upon
them and stood as shitten Gossips: Thirdly, the
place where, this is by the learned held in great
Dispute, but I beleeve in his infancie he was
sickly; and therefore according to the Church
of (^Englands^) Tenets he was twice Christned,
that is to say, at home here in (^England^) and
afterwards confirmed at (^Rome^) , the Mother
Church of all such Antichristian Heresies: but I
shall be over-tedious, therefore I will come to
the fourth Deuision,and that is by what
authoritie they doe these things: this will take up a
great deale of time to open and explaine unto
you, if I would doe it to purpose; therefore I
will omit it, onely certifying you thus much, that
there is no power under the Sun that hath any
authoritie to erect or build up, neither to destroy
and pull down any thing, save what is in the will
of the two Houses of Parliament.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] That word waked me, indeed I was
almost asleep; what, you say that the Parliament
hath power to pull down (^Christmas^) ; I pray then
what will they put up in the roome on't,
<P 13>
Stage-Playes, Dancing upon the Ropes, & (^Hocus Pocus^) .
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] No, it shall be like other Times, not
one day higher or lower then another; for it is
not for us to stand upon Times and Seasons.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Fie upon't, fie upon't, away with't, away
with't, I doe not know this Parliament, 'tis no kin
to me; If this is the Authoritie you talked of,
God deliver me from such Authoritie; this is
worser Authoritie then my Husbands, for though
my Husband beats me now and then, yet he gives
my belly full, and allowes me money in my purse;
which as I take it, the Parliament will not; for I
remember men come for money, money, and if I
aske them what it is, for they still keepe in one
tune like the Cockoe, and tell me it is for the
Parliament; God deliver me from those that will
neither let us eate our victualls and be merry,
though they don't pay for it; nor yet if they
could helpe it, leave us any money in our purses.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Then you doe not regard these
Powers, let them say or doe what they will.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] No indeed, not (^I^) ; is it not fitting I
should do what I will with mine own? Cannot I
keep (^Christmas^) , eat good Chear, & be Merry,
without I goe and get a Licence from the Parliament?
Marry gap, come up here, for my part Ile be
hanged by the neck first; must I be subject to them
I never saw in my life? No, no, neighbour, they
are mistaken in me; though they set up
Scare-Crowes to scare fooles withall, they shall not
fright me.
<P 14>
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Truely neighbour, if these Powers
and Authorities will not make you leave off this
Superstitious and Idolatrous Feasting, some
other sharper and more rigorous power must.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Must, doe you say? How now, you
said you did not come to Scold, but I see you will
Scold before you goe: I see now by the Masse,
there is no making hony of a Dogs-turd; that
which is bred in the bone will never out of the
flesh; your mother I faith hath taught you your
lerry, almost as perfect as she hath it her selfe: must
make me?
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Yes, must make you: I do not goe to
eate my words (^Gillian^) ; what I have spoken Ile
speake againe, I have those which shall
maintaine me in it, I care not who knows it, and that
is the honest godly partie of the Armie, of which
societie my Husband is a member; therefore
take heed what you say.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] What have I to doe with the Army, I
have nothing to say to the Army.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] But the Armie hath something to
say to you then: for if no power will tame you,
they can and will tame you; were you as fierce
as a Lyon, they will new-mould you into better
breeding, and make you leave off your
Superstitious Feasting, and turne to Fasting, if you doe
not mend your manners.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] As for the Armie, no doubt but there
may be some honest men amongst them, but all
<P 15>
the world knowes what thy Husband was, a poore
man which ran out of his Countrey for debt, and
afterwards betooke himselfe to be Master (^Percyes^)
Groome, to rub his Horses heeles in (^Drury-Lane^) ;
And now such as he is, must come to tame those
which are ten times better then themselves; this
is a fine world indeed.
   [$ (^M. New.^) $] Huswife, farewell; I have with
silence heard things of a dangerous Consequence
against the Parliament and Armie; therefore
looke to it, for you shall surely suffer for it; these
things cannot be let slip without severe
punishment, either with the deprivation of Life and
Libertie, or at least the losse of your Goods.
   [$ (^M. Cust.^) $] Devill, doe thy worst; if they are
honest men they will not doe it: Yet all this
Chattring shall not put me off from keeping
(^Christmas^) .
