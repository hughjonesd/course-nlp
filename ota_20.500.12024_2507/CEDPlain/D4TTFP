   [$ (^Council.^) $] Mr. (^Prance^) , did you give Evidence against #
(^Green^) , (^Berry^) and
(^Hill^) , for the Murder of Sir (^E. B. Godfrey^) ?
   [$ (^Prance.^) $] Yes Sir, I did.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Was (^Brown^) a Witness too?
   [$ (^Prance.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] Was (^Elizabeth Curtis^) ?
   [$ (^Prance.^) $] I Don't know, but I think she was.
   [$ (^Coun.^) $] (^Eliz. Curtis^) , were you a Witness for the     #
Murder of Sir (^E. B. 
Godfrey^) ?
   [$ (^E. Curtis.^) $] Yes if it please your Honour, my Lord.
   [$ (^Cryer.^) $] Sir (^John Nicholas^) , Sir (^Philip Floyd^) ,   #
(^William Bridgeman^) Esquire;
make room there Officers, go out, make room for the Witnesses to
come in. [$These three Gentlemen were sworn.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Sir (^Phillip Floyd^) , were these Papers      #
owned by (^Thompson^) , (^Farwel^) ,
and (^Pain^) , look on them.
   [$Sir (^Ph. F.^) $] My Lord, these are the two Papers I indorst   # 
with my own
hand, and they owned them to be their Writing, (^Farwell^) writ one of
them, and (^Pain^) the other, and they acknowledged that             #
(^Thompson^) Printed
them, and (^Thompson^) likewise confest the same before the Council. #
[$Sir
(^John Nicholas^) , and Esquire (^Bridgman^) spoke to the same       #
effect.$]
   [$Sir (^Fra. Withins.^) $] My. Lord, and you Gentlemen of the     #
Jury, you see that
(^Farwell^) and (^Pain^) owned the Writing of them and (^Thompson^)  #
the Printing
of them.
   [$Mr. (^Saunders.^) $] Which was it that (^Farwell^) did own.
   [$Sir (^J. Nicholas.^) $] (^Farwell^) did own the first read in   #
Council, and the other
the second, but I cannot certainly say which, but I markt them.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do you believe those Notes and Minutes to be   #
true?
   [$Sir (^John.^) $] Yes I took the Notes my Lord.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] Sir (^Philip^) , did (^Thompson^) own the      #
things produced the 29th of
(^March^) as (^Printed^) by him?
   [$Sir (^Phil.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^L. J. C.^) ^] Read the        #

[$Both the Letters being Read, and (^Nath. Thomsons^) Intelligences,
(^Numb.^) 125. and 127. Read likewise.$]
[$ (^Serj. Maynard^) Spake here very Learnedly, and descanting on    #
these
Letters, and Pamphlets, but with so low a voice that was not         #
Intelligible
to the Writer.$]
   [$Mr. (^Sanders.^) $] My Lord, Of all this Charg'd there is       #
nothing against
(^Pain^) but the second Letter. My Lord, he owns it as a very rash and
<P 4>
unadvised Act, but no malicious Act. (^Pain^) nor none of his Family
(My Lord) have been Enemies to the (^Government^) , or charged with
malicious designs against it, but this Act its Foolish and           #
Inconsiderate,
and we cannot Justify it, we submit our selves to your Lordship.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You have promised to prove it, and I will hear #
whatsoever
you can prove, I will hear any kind of proof you can make for it. It
is a business of mighty concern, and therefore not slightly to be past
over.
   [$ (^Council,^) $] We are sorry at what we have done, and we have #
offered
to give (^the Brothers^) any Satisfaction they desire, or we are     #
Capable
of.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Do not say so, for they told me themselves     #
that they would
make out what they had said by five hundred Witnesses.
   [$ (^Council.^) $] (^Farewell^) and (^Pain^) are not (^Papists^)  #
as they are reputed to be, but
are Protestants, for they have received the (^Sacrament^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray call your Witnesses, and make the best    #
on't you can.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] -- (^Boales^) , -- (^Scot^) , Mr. (^Pains^)      #
Witnesses.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] You shall be admitted to prove any thing you   #
can, because
they did say, that they would (^prove^) it by five hundred           #
Witnesses, and
make it as plain as the day.
   [$ (^C. Thomp.^) $] Since their hearing before the Council they   #
Vaunted in
(^Thompsons^) Intelligence, that they were ready with threescore     #
Witnesses
to prove all they had said.
   [$ (^Council,^) $] Call (^Thomsons^) Witnesses.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] (^William Ward^) , (^Fra. Hacker^) , (^Tho.      #
Scot^) . 
   [$One of them present, said$] (^I'le go call the rest^) .
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] And will you come again?
   [$ (^Council,^) $] I am Council here for Mr. (^Thompson^) , who   #
by the Direction
of Mr. (^Pain^) , and (^Farewell^) , Printed these Papers upon their #
promise to
make them good, and they have both confest that they were Written by
them, and Printed by him, although now they design to cast the       #
(^burden^)
upon his Shoulders; My Lord, as its a great mercy (the Murder being
Committed) that Persons concerned therein, have been Detected and
Punished, so it is a great mercy that the Authors of these Letters are
Discovered, and so also of the two Intelligences, they were as much  #
the
Authors of the one as the other; My Lord, (^Thompsons^) Intelligence #
is well
known to be (^open^) to all that will come and put any thing into    #
it, and
he is paid for his pains.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] He will be paid (^for his pains too, I hope^) .
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] (^Edward Fisher^) , (^John Hazard^) , Mr.        #
(^Culling^) , (^John Rawson^) and his
Wife, Witnesses for (^Farewell^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] (^Hazard^) , begin, what say you Sir?
   [$ (^John Hazard,^) $] My Lord, It was early in the Morning about #
six a
Clock, and happened the same day after Sir (^E. B. G.^) was found, Mr.
(^Pain^) desired me to walk with him, and coming towards the White
House we understood Sir (^E. B. G.^) was found, I had known him full
twenty Years before, and therefore knew him at first sight, his Shoes
<P 5>
were clean Bottom and Top, with (^Seeds^) sticking to them, as if he #
had
been in a Hay-mow.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Where was he?
   [$ (^Hazard,^) $] Upon a Table when I saw him, Then Mr. (^Pain^)  #
desired me
to go to the place where he had lain in the Ditch, and Mr. (^Pain^)
conducted me to the place, where I saw several Gobbits of Blood by the
Ditch side.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] (^William Batson^) , -- [$Sworn.$]
   [$ (^William Batson,^) $] Mr. (^Farewell^) and I walked into the  #
Fields in the
Morning.
   [$ (^Williams,^) $] Did you invite Mr. (^Farewell^) to go thither?
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] No, he desired to walk.
   [$ (^Williams,^) $] Did he carry you to the (^White-House^)       #
before he went to the
place where his Body lay?
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] No.
   [$ (^Williams,^) $] Did (^Farewell^) bring you to the place where #
the Body lay,
when it was carried to the (^White-House^) ?
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] Yes Sir, (^Farewell^) shewed me the (^place^) , #
and then conducted 
me to the House.
   [$ (^Council,^) $] How came you to go to this place?
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] The News was brought by a Fellow who was not    #
believed,
and by consent (^a Porter^) was sent out to inquire the Truth, when  #
the (^Porter^)
returned, he said the Body of Sir (^E. B. G.^) was found, and        #
carried to
the (^White-House^) , we (^ran^) thither and were there quickly, and #
there was
not above six there beside our selves.
   [$ (^Council,^) $] Did (^Farewell^) when he carried you to the    #
Ditch, say that was
the place?
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Council,^) $] Did (^any Body^) shew you the place beside     #
(^Farewell^) .
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] I had no acquaintance with any but him.
   [$ (^Council,^) $] Did any shew you the place, but (^Farewell^) , #
I say?
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] No Sir.
   [$ (^Council,^) $] Did he go directly?
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] We went directly, we went the straitest way to  #
the place,
and past over some Ditches. 
   [$ (^Council,^) $] Was any there beside Mr. (^Farewell^) and you, #
at the time you
went over Ditches, Did any direct you?
   [$ (^Batson,^) $] No.

[$Another Witness -- call'd and Sworn.$]

   [$ (^Witness,^) $] My Lord, That Morning the Murder was           #
discovered I went
with two or three of my Neighbours to see as others did, and when we
came to the (^White-House^) I saw Sir (^E. B. G.^) lie on the Table, #
his face
looked swarthy, and he seemed as though he had been (^Strangled^) ,
thence I walked to the Ditch, where they said his Body had lain,     #
(^they
showed^) me (^Blood^) there, but whether (^his^) or no, I cannot     # 
Swear.
<P 6>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was it a (^Frost^) then?
   [$ (^Answer,^) $] I do not know whether it was a Frost or no, it  #
is so long since,
it to me looked like (^Blood^) that was (^laid there^) , rather then #
any thing
else.
   [$ (^Another Witness,^) $] My Lord, I was Carpenter to my Lord -- #
and I
was sent for to the (^White-House^) , and as I went to take Orders,  #
I heard
the Report that Sir (^Edmond^) was found, I went on to my designed   #
place,
and when I came there, I saw Sir (^Edmond^) lie dead on the Table, I
turned his Coat up, I saw two wounds within an Inch and half of one
another, the one went no further then the bone, and the other        #
through his
back, and they brought to me the (^Sword^) which they said, they had #
pull'd
out of his Body. There was an Order to get him stript, I pull'd off  #
his
Shoes, his Shoes were (^clean^) , I pull'd off three pair of         #
Stockings, and a
pair of Socks, I pull'd off his black Breeches and Drawers, We set   #
him
on his breech upon the Table, with his Leggs hanging down, unbuttoned
his Coat and Wastcoat pull'd them off, but we could not bend his Arms
when we came to his Shirt, so we tore it open. Upon his Back, there
was some Blood, but upon his (^Flannel^) there was none. I have one  #
thing
more to say, There was a place Black round about his Throat, which
looked as if he had been (^Strangled^) , and his Neck was weak and   #
loose,
and had no strength at all in it, by which (^its Evident he was      #
Murdered^) .
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] The (^Blood^) is one of the Arguments which   #
induced me to do
what I have done: For as to the (^Circle^) about the Throat it is no #
more
then sometimes attend Persons in an Ordinary way, I was not present
in the Court at the Tryal of the (^supposed^) Murderers, when it was
strongly pretended there was no (^Blood^) there, whereas I'le Swear  #
there was
near a (^handful of Blood^) (My Lord) and I will tell (^you who laid #
it there^) .

Call (^Rawson^) and his Wife.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] (^Rawson^) and his Wife -- [$Sworn.$]
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] This man was the man that helped the Body out #
of the Ditch,
and carried it to the House, let him speak to it.
   [$ (^Rawson,^) $] I was the Person who upon the first Discovery   #
of the Body,
pull'd him out of the Ditch, when I had so done, pull'd the Sword out,
which was run through him, and then removed him to the House, There
was (^Blood^) , or like (^Blood^) and (^Water^) came from him, and   #
carrying him
into the House, while going in at the door his Back did swing against
the side of the door, and there was some (^Blood^) and (^Water^)     #
left there,
and likewise upon the Table where he was laid, and the Floor, and some
in the Cellar.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did the (^Blood^) run from the Body on the     #
(^Table^) , from thence
to the (^Floor^) , and then into the (^Cellar^) .
   [$ (^Rawson,^) $] There (^was Blood^) in all these places, but I  #
cannot say how it
came there, unless it came from the Body.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Upon your Oath do you know that was (^Blood^) ?
   [$ (^Rawson,^) $] I will not Swear whether it was clear (^Blood^) #
or no. [$ (At which
was a great noise in the Court.) $]
[^SOURCE TEXT HAS NO PAGES NUMBERED 7 OR 8.^]
<P 9>
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] Silence.
   [$ (^Farewell.^) $] My Lord, I desire the same Question may be
asked (^Rawson's^) Wife; Whether the Blood did not run from the
Body on the Table on the Floor, and down into the Cellar.
   [$ (^Raws. Wife,^) $] As Sir (^E. B. Godfrey's^) Body laid along  #
on the
Table, the Blood and Water ran from the Table on the
Floor.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] And did it run into the Cellar too?
   [$ (^Raws. Wife,^) $] I am sure the Bottles were wet with Blood
there.
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] My Lord, now to the next Point, it is the
difference between Mr. (^Bedlow's^) and Mr. (^Prance's^) Evidence, I #
have
the (^Journal^) of the House of Lords, and I will undertake to
prove it. Call (^John Stanly^) .
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] (^John Stanly^) , Come into the Court.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What is it you would have of him?
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I would have him prove the Copy of the        #
(^Journal^)
of the House of Lords.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What use do you then make of it?
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I say there is a great difference between the
Evidence of (^Bedlow^) and him, and I will produce the Journal to
prove that whereas (^Prance^) said he was (^strangled^) with a
Handkerchief, (^Bedlow^) in his Depositions before the House of Lords
asserted he was (^stifled with a Pillow^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Can you prove that (^Bedlow^) gave that        #
Evidence?
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] Yes my Lord, by Mr. (^Whinyard^) ,            #
(^Walker^) , and 
others. Call them.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] Mr. (^Whinyard^) , Mr. (^Walker^) , Mr.          #
(^Hobbs^) , Mr. (^John
Chase^) , Mr. (^James Chase^) , -- [$sworn.$]
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I ask Mr. (^James Chase^) but this Question,  #
Who it
was (^unbuttoned^) his Collar?
   [$ (^James Chase,^) $] That day, after the Body was found, I went
in company to the Field, and then to the place where they
said the said Body had been; I look'd into the Ditch, and
could see no sign of Blood there; but on the side of the Ditch,
four or five yards distant, was some, (^as appeared to me^) ;
which they said had followed the Sword when it was pull'd out 
of the Body. Then I went where the Body lay, and view'd it.
I saw two wounds under the left Pap, his Throat was (^black^) and
blew upon opening the Collar near the breadth of an Hand,
and his Face was very much swelled: I believe he was 
(^strangled by others^) , for I cannot believe all those Injuries    #
could
otherwise attend him after he was dead.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] Mr. (^Hobbs^) -- [$sworn.$]
<P 10>
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I desire that Mr. (^Hobbs^) may be ask'd, If  #
he did not
propose to Mr. (^Michael Godfrey^) that his Brothers Body might
be opened, whereby he might certainly know whether he
was murdered or no.
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] My Lord, I did believe he was (^strangled^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr. (^Hobbs^) , Did you desire his Body might be
opened? And did you say, It might be very well, if Mr.
(^Michael Godfrey^) would send for a Doctor and Surgeon from the
Court, to have him opened, that all might be fully satisfied
that he was murdered?
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] My Lord, I was satisfied in my self that he
was (^strangled^) , and had those wounds from others; I did
not advise it for my particular Information, but that of
others.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray what (^colour^) was his Face?
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] He was (^black^) and (^swarthy^) , and the    #
white of his
Eyes and the Blood Vessels were as full as those that are troubled
with Sore Eyes.
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I desire to know if he had Fly-blows in his
Eyes?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Had he Fly-blows in his Eyes?
   [$Mr. (^Hobbs,^) $] No my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^John Chase,^) $] I walked to see this Body which I heard  #
was
found, I found a great (^Contusion^) upon the left Muscle. I
troubled my self no more at that time. I was desired after this by
Doctor (^Lloyd^) to go with him, and coming there to review the
Body, I observed a Swelling under the left Ear, together with
several other Contusions, which were very surprising, for (my
Lord) I never found any so (^contused^) in all my life. My Lord,
When we had heard the Matter of Evidence and the Persons
charg'd with the Crime, Mr. (^Farewell^) one day called me aside,
and told me what proof he could make in this Business against
the Evidence. Then said I, Mr. (^Farewell^) you are my Friend, I
would advise you for your good; I believe nothing can be
made appear against it. I saw not Mr. (^Farewell^) for a
considerable time after: Afterwards on the (^Eve^) of (^Easter-day^) I
met Mr. (^Farewell^) , and it was thus; I had been drinking a
Glass of Wine with some Friends, Mr. (^Farewell^) came in and
asked for one; so they knowing him, called for another
Bottle. Said I, Because Mr. (^Farewell^) is come, I will drink
another Glass with him, although I was taking my leave. We
fell into some Discourse, and talking of this Subject, he told
me, That Six Months before I had given him (^good Counsel^) , if
he could have taken it.
<P 11>
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] Mr. (^Smith^) the Cook, Mr. (^Tho. Smith^) , Mr. # 
(^Brown^) ,
-- [$sworn.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr. (^Farewell^) , What would you have from    #  
these
Witnesses?
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] My Lord, I would have you to ask, Whether Sir
(^E. B. Godfrey's^) Eyes were not Fly-blown?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr. (^Brown^) , It's proposed to you by Mr.    #
(^Farewell^) ,
Whether the Eyes of Sir (^E. B. Godfrey^) were Fly-blown?
   [$Mr. (^Brown,^) $] No my Lord, not that I saw.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was there any specks that were like Fly-blows?
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] My Lord, I'll call two Witnesses more, and will
prove it.
   [$Mr. (^Brown,^) $] No my Lord, I saw no (^specks^) like Fly-blows.
Mr. (^Farewell^) was with me, and told me his Eyes were
Fly-blown, and would fain have me said such things, if I would
have said them.

[$ (^ (A great Noise about the Court.) ^) $]

   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] My Lord the Kings Justice commands all Persons to
keep silence upon pain of Imprisonment.
   [$Mr. (^Brown,^) $] He came another time, and told me, that I
was wrong in my (^ (\Affidavit\) ^) , as though he knew it better than
my self.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Where was this?
   [$Mr. (^Brown,^) $] He was at my House.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Was Mr. (^Pain^) with him?
   [$Mr. (^Brown,^) $] My Lord, I did not know Mr. (^Pain^) , and 
therefore cannot say whether he was there or no.
   [$ (^Council,^) $] Do you know Mr. (^Thompson^) , was he with
him?
   [$Mr. (^Brown,^) $] I know not (^Thompson^) , therefore cannot    #
say that
he was.
[$ (^Cryer,^) Mr. (^Nath. Thompson^) and Mr. (^Pain^) , being        #
called, did
not appear.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] What do you ask Mr. (^Smith^) ?
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] The same Question about the (^Blood^) , and 
whether he did not carry some of it away in his Handkerchief?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Pray tell Mr. (^Farewell^) Whether you took up #
any
of Sir (^E. B. Godfrey's^) Blood, and carried it home in your
Handkerchief?
   [$Mr. (^Smith,^) $] My Lord, When I went that way Sir (^E. B.     
Godfrey's^) Body was removed, before I got thither; I viewed the
<P 12>
place where they said he laid: and indeed I was ask'd, 
Whether I saw any Blood there?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you not take any of Sir (^E. B.            #
Godfrey's^) Blood
in your Handkerchief?
   [$ (^Smith,^) $] No not I, my Lord.
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] Call (^Rawson^) and his Wife. My Lord, I will #
prove
by these Witnesses that his Eyes were (^Fly-blown^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] (^Rawson^) , Mr. (^Farewell^) enquires of you, #
If you saw
any thing like Fly-blows in Sir (^E. B. Godfrey's^) Eyes?
   [$ (^Rawson,^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Did you observe the Flies busie at that time   #
of the
year?

[$ (^A great Laughter in the Court, the time being
in the midst of^) Octob. (^and Snowy Weather^) .$]

   [$ (^Rawson,^) $] I did see something like Fly-blows.
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] Call (^Rawson's^) Wife.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] (^Rawson's^) Wife, come into the Court.
   [$ (^Rawson.^) $] I must fetch her then.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] Make Room there for (^Rawson^) and his Wife.
   [$ (^People,^) $] They will not come.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] Make Room for them if they will come. (^Rawson's^)
Wife, (^Rawson's^) Wife, come into the Court.
   [$ (^Answ.^) $] Here.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] Make room there, stand clear there, make room.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Woman, Mr. (^Farewell^) desires to know if there
were (^Fly-blows^) in the Eyes of Sir (^E. B. Godfrey^) .
   [$ (^R. Wife,^) $] My Lord, people said they were (^Fly-blows^) .
[^SOURCE TEXT: (^Fly-bows^) ^]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] He asks too what you say to the Corners of his #
Mouth
and Nostrils.
   [$ (^R. Wife,^) $] I did not take much notice of them; but they   #
did say
they were (^Fly-blown^) .
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I have seen many a one who have dyed a natural
death, in whom I have seen as much alteration as in him, and
my Lord, I can prove, that the Discolouring of the Face, and the
Circle about the Neck, might have another cause then they make
the World believe. [$ (^Cryer,^) $] Call -- the Kings Surgeon.
-- [$Sworn.$]
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] (^Farewell^) says, That many persons dying a   #
Natural
Death may look as he did.
   [$ (^Surg.^) $] My Lord he was certainly (^strangled^) , and      #
sometimes
persons may be (^strangled^) and yet look pale: If that which
<P 13>
strangled him had been taken away while his Body was warm, the
Vessels would have been less, and his Face would have been
very Pale: Therefore it's evident that that which (^strangled^) him, 
was not removed till his Body was cold, which was the occasion
of that blackness; for the Knot remaining, the Blood could not
run away: He had as high a Colour as if in a Scarlet Feavor;
and the Blood that was seen by me four yards from the Ditch,
I put my finger into it, and it smelt like Blood a fortnight or three
Weeks from any Body. My Lord, I presume it was Blood came
off the Womb, (^&c.^) His Neck was very much swell'd and
black, on one side of his Mouth he was discoloured; where-ever
any Man is bruised while he has life, or while warm, the parts
so bruised when dead will soonest corrupt; as is a common
thing. Mr. (^Chess^) the Apothecary unbuttening his Collar found
two great Creases about his Neck, and desired me to come and
see it; and the mark was like that of a strait Ring upon a Finger,
and while we with-drew to drink two or three Glasses of Beer,
there remained only this Crease above.
   [$Sir (^F. Winington,^) $] Do you believe he killed himself now
Mr. (^Farewell^) ?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Were his Eyes (^Fly-blown^) and Shut?
   [$ (^Surgeon,^) $] There was something in the Corners of his Eyes
that looked like matter; but I can't say it was (^Fly-blown^) . His
Eyes were open and Blood-shotten, like a Man that has had an
extraordinary violence used towards that part; or like a Man
that hath had an extraordinary Cold.
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] Were not his (^Eye-lashes^) closed?
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Were his (^Eye-lashes^) closed?
   [$ (^Surgeon,^) $] No my Lord, his Eyes were open.
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] When I saw him his Eyes were shut I am sure.
   [$ (^Surgeon,^) $] I am sensible, my Lord, that a (^great Storm^) #
of Hail
and Rain had faln the (^Night before^) , and that his Cloths were as
(^dry^) as mine, and as whole as mine.
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I will tell your Lordship the reason of that, #
he
was removed by the Constable at Seven a Clock the Night
before, and they made a great (^Fire^) , and so dried his Clothes.

[$ (^ (A Laughter in the Court.) ^) $]

   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Mr. (^Farewell^) , Will you call any more      #
Witnesses?
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I will call no more, my Lord, I am look'd upon
with an (^evil eye^) ; they'll censure me as a (^Papist, &c.^)
<P 14>
   [$ (^Council,^) $] You are Guilty of a worse Crime, Sir.
   [$ (^Farewell,^) $] I submit my self to the Law.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] It matters not what (^Religion^) you are of,   #
since ye are
guilty of such Crimes.
   [$ (^Serj. Maynard,^) $] Here is a high Offence against the
Government and Justice of the Nation, against the
Reputation of a Person of Worth and Integrity, after
they had murdered his (^Person^) , to endevour the
murdering of his (^Good Name^) . These persons have
undertaken to manage it; all the Witnesses Mr. (^Farewell^) has
brought, have contradicted him in all he have said.
No (^Blood^) , no (^Fly-blows^) , but Stranglings, Stabs, and
Bruises; and for a Man that should stab himself, how
could he bruise himself too in that manner? Yet they
have asserted they would prove it by 500 Witnesses,
but could he produce but one substantial one, it were
well for him. But what have he or they to do with a
matter of this nature? The Justice of the Kingdom
has past upon (^Green^) , (^Berry^) , and (^Hill^) for the said
Murder upon (^Clear Evidence^) ; but suppose something might
have been said, it became them not to arraign the
Government and the Justice of the Kingdom in its
Administrations. Sir (^E. B. Godfrey^) was certainly murdered,
and we know by whom. I'll produce two or three
Witnesses that shall produce (^more than ever yet^) ; and if there
were no more, there would be Evidence enough. My
Lord, I desire that Mr. (^Prance^) may tell us the manner of
his Murder and the Circumstances.
   [$ (^Sol. General,^) $] Mr. (^Farewell^) has told us (^many       #
Lies^) , and
he leaves the World to make Inferences from them, and
has brought Witnesses to prove some pretended
Contradictions, and therefore Sir (^E. B. Godfrey^) murdered
himself; this Fellow is guilty of the (^highest malice^) in the
World, he has told you all these things which appear
false, and from those falsities they would have inferred
another, that (^he murdered himself^) .
<P 15>
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] Brother (^Maynard^) , I have given him leave to
bring what Evidence he would, not that I think it
(^material^) ; and if he could have proved never so much, his
(^malice^) had been never the less; but we see that his own
Evidence runs counter to him. What had he to do in
that Case? to what purpose should he write (^Books^) about
the Government, to traduce the Justice of it? This
ought not to be done under whatsoever pretences. It
has been sufficiently proved that Sir (^E. B. Godfrey was
murdered^) , but there are other Witnesses yet can speak
to it. -- Call them.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] (^John Okely^) , (^Mary James^) .
   [$ (^People,^) $] Make room for the Witnesses there.
   [$ (^Cryer,^) $] (^Mary James^) .
   [$ (^Sol. General,^) $] Gentlemen, It's beyond contradiction
that Sir (^E. B. Godfrey^) was (^murdered^) , and therefore shall
not need further (^Witness^) to prove it; we shall leave it to
you, and shall not trouble our selves or you any further
about it.
   [$ (^L. C. J.^) $] They did design, and would, no doubt of it, 
have been very much satisfied, if they could have made
some (^probable proof^) that he kill'd himself: But I was
desirous to hear what they could say for themselves. All
the Evidence they call, go as much against them as
can be; the Evidence is as plain as the day that the Man
was killed, and (^kill'd by Strangers^) . Besides, Sirs, a
private person must not undertake to controul the
Justice of the Nation: To say he was a just person that
suffered, and I will justifie it; this is not to be indured:
but I was willing to hear all that could be said, and
whether a doubt could be made; and you see his very
Evidence conclude him kill'd, and kill'd by Strangers.
They are all Three in this Mischief, there is a
Combination of them to affront the Publick Justice of the
Nation, but the end of this Design is to make you believe
here was no (^Popish Plot^) ; the (^Snake^) lies under the
<P 16>
(^Bush^) , if they could have vomited it, and made a 
tolerable Proof, That Sir (^E. B. Godfrey^) had not been (^kill'd^) .
But it's very plain if that could have been brought to
be (^a Doubt^) , then presently you would have had a full
Cry, (^Oh this is a Sham, a Sham^) , a thing raised against
the Papists; and then the Plot and all such things had
been nothing. I leave it to you, Whether upon this
Evidence you do not believe them (^all Guilty^) of 
Traducing the Government and the Justice of the
Nation.

   [$After which, the Jury having a while consulted 
together, gave in their (^Verdict^) without going from the
Bar,
(^That the said^) Nathaniel Thompson,
(^Mr.^) Farewell, (^and Mr.^) Pain, (^were
all^) Guilty (^of the Matter contained in
the Information^) .
(^ (Upon which the People gave a great Shout.) ^)
And Mr. (^Farewell^) was carried back to the 
(^Kings-Bench^) , but (^Thompson^) and (^Pain^) not appearing, the
Judgment of the Court is daily expected against them
all Three.$]
