   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Whose Lodgings did you go to?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] The Lodgings of Mr. (^Layer^) : Mr. (^Layer^)    #
was at home, and desir'd us to
go to the (^Gryffin^) Tavern in (^Holborn^) and he would meet us     #
there; we went, and in
a little while Mr. (^Layer^) came to us, and then Dr. (^Murphey^)    #
told him that I was
the Gentleman he had spoke to him of. Mr. (^Layer^) was glad of my   #
Acquaintance,
and told me that he had had such a strong Recommendation of me, that #
he
was fully satisfyed in me; and then he held a Discourse about a      #
Rising that was
to be in the Kingdom in favour of the Pretender, and that it would   #
be back'd by a
great many of the Army and the Guards, and several other Gentlemen.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] The Overt Act is laid in (^Essex^) , and #
here is an Evidence given
of an Overt Act in (^Middlesex^) ; with Submission they can give no  #
Evidence of an
Overt Act in another County, till they give Evidence of an Overt Act #
in (^Essex^) ,
where the Indictment is laid.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Jus.^) $] All they say of Matters in the County of   #
(^Middlesex^) , unless they
give Evidence of Overt Acts in the County of (^Essex^) , it          #
signifies nothing.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] My Lord, with Submission they ought not  #
to be suffer'd to
give Evidence of any Overt Act in (^Middlesex^) , before they give   #
Evidence of some
Overt Act in (^Essex^) ; for the proving some Overt Act in (^Essex^) #
is the only Thing
which can entitle them to prove any Overt Act elsewhere. For by the  #
Method
they would go on in, the Jury may be captivated with a Story of the  #
(^Gryffin^)
Tavern, and of Mr. (^Layer's^) other Assignations and Actions in     #
(^Middlesex^) , which
cannot be imputed to him upon this Indictment until some Treason be  #
proved in (^Essex^) :
I hope therefore the King's Counsel shall receive your Lordship's    #
Directions to go
on regularly, to begin to give an Account of the Overt Acts in       #
(^Essex^) , before they
go into another County.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Jus.^) $] Mr. (^Hungerford^) , you must give them    #
leave to go on in their own
Method, of that that first happen'd in (^Middlesex^) , and           #
afterwards of what
happen'd in (^Essex^) ; and if you dare not trust them and us, but   #
will have your own
Method, it would be to put us into Confusion.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] My Lord, we insist upon it in point of    #
Law, that we are intitled
to give Evidence of Overt Acts of the same Species of Treason laid   #
in the
Indictment, though done in any County in (^England^) , provided we   #
also prove an Overt
Act in the County of (^Essex^) ; which we must do, otherwise this    #
will pass for 
nothing. Mr (^Lynch^) , go on, and give my Lord and the Jury an      #
Account of what
Mr. (^Layer^) said, when you were together at the (^Griffin^) Tavern.
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] The first thing he told me was, that he was very #
glad to meet me, that
he had had a good Recommendation of me from Dr. (^Murphey^) , as     #
being a Man he
could confide in; and beginning his Discourse of an Insurrection in  #
the Kingdom,
he told me, that they were back'd with a great many of the Army and  #
the Guards,
that there was a great many of the Nobility and Gentry of the        #
Country that
would come in to 'em: He told me then, that he wanted a Man of       #
Resolution that
would take upon him the seizing of some Person of Note, as a         #
General, or some
other great Man. The Discourse run all upon the same thing.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Recollect as well as you can, the         #
Particulars Mr. (^Layer^) told you
relating to this Design.
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He told me the general Design of the Revolution  #
in the Kingdom, in
favour of the Pretender, and that they were back'd by a great many   #
of the Army,
and a great many of the Nobility and Gentry; and then he told me he  #
wanted a
Man of Resolution, to undertake with some others, to seize a great   #
Man, as a
General or some other great Man: At that Time I took upon my self to #
do it, so
at that time we discours'd no more.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] How long were you together?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] About half an Hour.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] When had you the next Meeting?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] A Day or two afterwards.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] At what Place?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] At the same Tavern, the (^Griffin^) Tavern; when #
I came there I sent a
Boy for Mr. (^Layer^) , as he had ordered me to do when I wanted to  #
see him.
<P 48>
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Jus.^) $] When was your first Meeting?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] About the Month of (^June^) .
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Jus.^) $] And the 2=d= Meeting was two or three Days #
after the first?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] At your parting after the first      #
Meeting, what did Mr. (^Layer^)
say to you?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Mr. (^Layer^) told me, if I had occasion to      #
speak to him that I shou'd not
come to his Lodgings, but go to a Tavern and send for him, which I   #
did; I sent
a Boy for him, and he came to me. Then talking over a Glass of Wine, #
he
told me that he had pitched upon me to seize the Earl of             #
(^Cadogan^) , and that I
shou'd chuse as many Persons as I thought fit who wou'd answer the   #
same
Design; and he being the principal Man in the Army, it wou'd         #
discourage the
King's Party, and animate the Pretender's Party; which as I said     #
before, I agreed
to undertake, and to do the utmost of my Endeavours to do it.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Was you to do it alone, or was you   #
to have any
Assistance?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, I was to have Assistance.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] What Assistance?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Such that I shou'd chuse, such People that I     #
cou'd confide in.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Did you undertake it?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, I did undertake it, and to pitch upon such  #
Persons as shou'd be
proper to assist me in it.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Was any thing said at that time relating  #
to any Person, who
was to have the Conduct of the Design?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He told me that there was some great Man that    #
did not want Wit,
Courage or Resolution, and was at the head of this Affair, who wou'd #
at a proper
time give me an Order to effect something further about it.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Had you any more Discourse with the       #
Prisoner about this
Affair?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, we had several Discourses about it.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Tell my Lord and the Jury what more        #
Discourse you had, if
you can remember.
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] The chief Part I was to act was to seize the     #
Earl of (^Cadogan^) , with such
Gentlemen as I should think proper to answer the end of seizing him.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Was there any other Meeting, and     #
when and how long
after?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] After that I came to a Tavern in (^Holbourn^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] How long after?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Some few Days; it was at the (^Castle^) Tavern   #
in (^Holbourn^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att.Gen.^) $] Who was with you at that Tavern?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I came to the Tavern and sent for Mr. (^Layer^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did he come to you?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, he came to me.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What Discourse had you with him at that    #
time? 
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] We had no particular Discourse, but in general   #
we talk'd about the
Uneasiness of the Nation, and the fair Opportunity there was to rise.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray give an Account of what else pass'd.
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I say, the same Discourse that we had had at two #
Meetings before, he
repeated, and said, now is a fair Opportunity, the Uneasiness of the #
People being
such, to bring about a Revolution, since they would be back'd by the #
Army and
the Guards, and several other People. Soon after that we parted.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] When had you any other Meeting?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Some Meetings we had at Mr. (^Layer's^) House in #
(^Southampton-Buildings^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] How long after?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] A few Days only.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] At the several Meetings at his       #
House, what was the Subject
of your Discourse?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] It was always upon the same, about the Rising    #
and Uneasiness of the
People, and the fair Opportunity of bringing about a Revolution, of  #
the
Disposition of the Army and the Guards.
<P 49>
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Did he give you any Encouragement?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] After I met him at his House in                  #
(^Southampton-buildings^) , I told him of
my Uneasiness, because he had told me at the beginning, that these   #
Things would
be soon put in Execution: I told him, if they were delayed, I was    #
afraid they
wou'd not succeed. He then animated me, by telling me that there was #
no fear
of its succeeding; and that I should not be discouraged, for there   #
was a Great
Man, a Man of Wit and Conduct, that was at the Helm, and that had the
Management of the Scheme: That I should always keep a good Heart;    #
and that
Things went on very well.
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $] Did he tell you in whose Favour this was to be?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes; in Favour of the Pretender. He mentioned    #
him by the Name
of King.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Do you know any thing about his      #
going into the
Country?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] After I met him at his House, he went into the   #
Country, and staid
sixteen or seventeen Days; at his Return, I went to see him, and     #
expressing how
uneasy I was about the Delay.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] About what Time was this?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I believe it was in (^July^) . And then I told   #
him again how uneasy I was
at the Delay. To which he answer'd, Keep a good Heart, all Things go #
on
very well.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Had you any Apprehensions that all   #
was to be done at
home, or that you was to have any foreign Assistance?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] In my Discourse to him of the Uneasiness I was   #
under at the Delay,
I asked him if he had any Promise of any Succour from any Power      #
Abroad? He
told me, if we once made a Beginning, we should not want them: But   #
did
insinuate, that we should not want Encouragement from the Court of   #
(^France^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] When you expressed your Uneasiness at the  #
Delay, what did
he say to encourage you?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] The reason he told me was, that Things went on   #
very well, and would
very soon be put in Execution.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] In what manner did you express your        #
Uneasiness?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Nothing but that I was uneasy, and I was afraid  #
that Things did go
wrong.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] What did you say, did you say any thing   #
relating to your own
Circumstances?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] In the Beginning I told Dr. (^Murphey^) ,        #
because it would be a long
while, some five or six Weeks, before I was to be introduced to Mr.  #
(^Layer's^)
Company, that I came on my own particular Business, and my           #
Circumstances
would not permit me to be long here at my own Expence. At the        #
meeting with
Mr. (^Layer^) , when I first made this Complaint to him, Mr.         #
(^Layer^) told me I should
not want for a small Matter, to maintain me in (^England^) .         #
Accordingly Mr. (^Layer^)
gave me some Money.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Do you remember how much that was?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I cannot remember.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did he give you Money at any other Time?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Mr. (^Layer^) gave me some Money the first Time, #
and afterwards he sent
me some Money by Dr. (^Murphey^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Did he give you any Money at any     #
other Time?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, the last Time I was with him I had more.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] How many Times had you Money of him?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Five or six Times.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Do you know what the Sums did amount to    #
together?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I can't recollect; but I believe about eight or  #
ten Guineas.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What was it given you for?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] To keep me in (^England^) , and to assist in the #
intended Design of a
Revolution.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] After you went to him, upon his      #
Return out of the 
Country, do you remember the Discourse that pass'd between you then?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes: After I came to his House, I expressed my   #
Uneasiness at the
Delay: Upon which he encouraged me, giving me to hope that Things    #
went on
very well, and our Design would effectually take Place.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Did you ask him any thing about the  #
Army?
<P 50>
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I asked him if he had any Encouragement from the #
Guards and the
Army? He told me, Yes, he had; that a great many of the Officers     #
would not
engage themselves now, being well paid; but he said he had spoke     #
with several
Officers of the Guards, who had assured him, that most of the common #
Soldiers
would come in, as soon as we made a Beginning.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Did he mention any thing of the Time?
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] When you asked him if he had any          #
Encouragement from the
Army, what did he say?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He told me, That he had Encouragement from a     #
great many of the
Officers of the Army: That he had discoursed with several Serjeants  #
of the
Guards, who told him that the common Soldiers would be glad, after   #
they had
made a Beginning, to come in to 'em.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] Did he give you any Reason for this?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Mr. (^Layer^) told me, the Serjeants told him so #
before they were
encamped, and complained of their ill Usage, and hard Usage from the #
subaltern
Officers.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Was you acquainted with any Time, or #
Day that was
fixed?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] There was no fix'd Time: Mr. (^Layer^) told me,  #
it was to be on the
rising of the Camp; because they could not talk with the Soldiers so #
well, while
they were encamped, as they could afterwards, when they were in their
Quarters.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Was there any Consultation of        #
viewing any one's House?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Afterwards, in Discourse he told me, that it was #
fit to go and view
the Earl of (^Cadogan's^) House; in case it was necessary to seize   #
the said Lord in his
House.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Where is his House?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] In (^Pickadilly^) . Accordingly we appointed a   #
Day to go; and I came
to his Lodgings, and we took Coach, and away we went; and talking to #
him
about it, he told me, he was very well acquainted with my Lord       #
(^Cadogan^) , and
had some Business with him, about an estate which his Lordship was   #
about buying:
We went to his House, but my Lord was not to be spoke with, or was   #
not within, I
don't remember which, but we were conducted into his House; we       #
view'd the
inner Part of the House, afterwards we went into the Garden, we      #
viewed the
lower Part of the Garden, then we went out in the Yard, and took a   #
View of
the Avenues round about the House. I don't remember exactly the      #
Time, but
it was that Day that a Soldier should have been shot in              #
(^Hyde-Park^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Had you any Discourse about the      #
Feasibleness of it?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, that it was easy to be done; if we had but  #
some resolute
Gentlemen to stand by us, that it was very feasible to be done.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Had you any Talk at that Time        #
relating to the (^Tower^) ?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He told me, the (^Tower^) would be immediately   #
surrender'd to the Party;
on the Day the Plot was to be put in Execution, a certain Officer of #
the Guards
would take upon him to mount the Guards there, who would facilitate  #
the
Delivery of the (^Tower^) to them.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Was there any Talk of the Mint?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, afterwards: He said there would be no doubt #
of the Mint; they
would be glad to take the Opportunity to shake off their             #
Confinement: And that
they would put Arms into their Hands, according as they repaired to  #
their 
Party.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] When did you see the Prisoner next after   #
the Time that you
speak of, of viewing my Lord (^Cadogan's^) House?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I saw him at his own House, and at several       #
Taverns in the City; and
once he wrote to me, desiring me to come to his Lodging;             #
accordingly I went,
and when I came to his House, I met with a little Paper that was     #
left for me,
directing me to go to the (^Queen's-head^) Tavern in                 #
(^Great Queen's-street^) , near
(^Lincoln's-Inn-Fields^) , and to enquire there for one Mr.          #
(^Wilson^) ; which I did, and I
was conducted into a Room where they said Mr. (^Wilson^) was, with   #
Mr. (^Layer^) ,
and another Man, who seem'd, by his Clothes, to be a Serjeant of the #
Guards.
I do not know the Man.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What pass'd then?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] We staid a little while there, we talk'd over    #
the Business, and drank
good Success to the Enterprize.
<P 51>
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Your Lordship will please to take    #
notice, That when he
went to Mr. (^Layer's^) Lodging, he found a Letter there, directing  #
him to go to the
(^Queen's-Head-Tavern^) , and enquire for one (^Wilson^) ; that when #
he came there,
(^Wilson^) was there, and Mr. (^Layer^) and another Man.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] What passed at that Time?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Nothing material.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] You talk'd about drinking good Success to  #
the Enterprize:
Who drank that?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] We all drank that.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did the Prisoner at the Bar drink it?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, he did. I told the Prisoner, when he went   #
out, that I was
mighty uneasy at the Delay of this Affair. He told me, I need not be #
uneasy, for
every Thing went on well; and they had a Nobleman at the Helm, who had
Authority from the Pretender, and would lose no Opportunity when a   #
fit Time
offered.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] What did he call the Pretender?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He called him the King. I was uneasy at the      #
Delay, for fear of being
discover'd.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] What Reason did he give you, why you      #
should not be
uneasy?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Because their Designs were quickly to be put in  #
Execution; and there
was a Nobleman at the Helm who would put the Design in Execution, as
having full Power and Authority from the King to act as he thought   #
proper.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] Did you ask who that Nobleman was?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes; but he never told me his Name, but said,    #
that I should, in a
proper Time, be presented to him, and receive my Commission and      #
Orders from him
to seize my Lord (^Cadogan^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] My Lord, we shall now gratify the    #
Prisoner's Counsel,
with an Account of what happened in (^Essex^) ; I hope they will not #
be impatient
to hear that: Therefore, pray acquaint my Lord, and the Jury, when   #
you went
out of Town with Mr. (^Layer^) .
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] My Lord, I was at Mr. (^Layer's^) House the Day  #
when the Bishop of
(^Rochester^) was sent to the (^Tower^) ; he ask'd me, if I would    #
ride abroad with him
the next Day to take the Air; I consented to it, and came the next   #
Morning to
his House; and Mr. (^Layer^) asked me, if I mounted with Furniture:  #
I told him
no; but that I had a double Barrel Fowling-piece, which if his       #
Servant would
carry, would do as well. He then desired me to go and stay for him   #
without
(^Aldgate^) , and get my Gun ready loaden, for he had that about him #
which he would
not lose for any thing in the World. I went and staid till about ten #
or eleven a
Clock, when Mr. (^Layer^) met me, and gave the Gun to his Servant to #
carry. On
the Road he told me, we were going to my Lord (^North^) and          #
(^Gray's^) , whom he was
very well acquainted with, and that he would recommend me to him as  #
a Friend
of his. When we got to the (^Green Man^) , he told me, we had better #
go in and
dine there, because Dinner-time would be over before we could get to #
my Lord
(^North^) and (^Gray's^) . Whilst Dinner was getting ready, we had   #
several Discourses
on the same Subject, of the Uneasiness of the Nation, and its        #
Inclination to a
Revolution, and how to bring it about; upon which, he pulled a Paper #
out of
his Pocket, and gave it me to read the latter Part of it.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Can you remember what it contained?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I remember some Lines of it; which was, in       #
general, to invite the
Nation to an Insurrection, and to shake off the Calamities and       #
Miseries they
endured under the present Ministry. And it was mentioned in the said #
Paper, that
the Earl of (^Cadogan^) was actually in their Custody; thereby       #
encouraging the Army
to revolt, with an Offer of three Guineas to every Horseman and      #
Serjeant, and
two Guineas to every Corporal, and one Guinea to every common        #
Soldier, to be
paid immediately on their joining the Party, and a Promise of farther
Preferment.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you read this?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I did, out of the Paper in Mr. (^Layer's^) Hand.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Do you know whose Hand-writing it was?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] According to our Discourse, I thought it might   #
be his writing.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] But he produced it?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, my Lord, he produced it.
<P 52>
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] You say you imagine, from some Discourse  #
between you, that it
was his Hand-writing; what Reason was there, in all his Discourse,   #
that
induced you to think so?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He talk'd of it as being of his own making;      #
besides, there were several
Interliniations, Dashings-out, and Interliniations afterwards. He    #
was very well
satisfied and easy as to me, and said, he could wish that he could   #
bring Matters about
so, as that I could have the sole Direction of seizing some of the   #
Ministry, and
namely, my Lord (^Townshend^) , my Lord (^Carterett^) , and Mr.      #
(^Walpole^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there any Discourse about seizing the  #
King?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He said, when the Design was put in Execution,   #
the Army would
declare in their Favour, and they would send a strong Guard to take  #
care of the
King's Person.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] How to take care of the King's Person?     #
What was you to do?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Nothing but to secure the King's Person; by what #
he told me, it was
for the Publick Good of the Kingdom; that they did not mean, nor had #
they
any Design on the King's Person, but only to keep him in Security    #
from any
Insult.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What more passed at that Time?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Nothing more in particular.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Had you any talk relating to the Army?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I said before what related to the Army.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Was there any Discourse about a      #
Scheme or Plan?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He told me there was a Scheme laid on that Foot, #
of which I told you
the first Step was to seize the Earl of (^Cadogan^) , and then,      #
according as the Army
came over, to take care and seize the King's Person; and he thought  #
the proper
Time to put this in Execution, would be at the Rising of the Camp in
(^Hyde-Park^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Was there any Objection made to this?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No; I made no Objection, only shew'd my          #
Uneasiness at the long
Delay.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] When you so express'd your           #
Uneasiness, what did he say? 
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He told me, if I could think or propose any      #
Thing more proper, that
I should do it. After that we rode toward (^Epping^) , and went to   #
my Lord (^North^) and
(^Gray's^) ; and there Mr. (^Layer^) introduced me as his Friend. We #
staid there all
Night, and dined there the next Day. In the Evening we came away in
Company with another Gentleman that I did not know; but we talk'd on #
the Road about
the Situation of my Lord's House; and Mr. (^Layer^) told me, he had
recommended me to his Lordship, as his particular Friend, and ask'd  #
me how I liked him.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Did he ask you any Questions? Do you #
remember what he
called his Lordship?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I don't remember any other Name but (^My Lord^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] When he ask'd your Opinion of him,   #
and how you liked
him, did he describe him in any other manner, or only called him     #
(^My Lord^) ?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] He only called him my Lord (^North^) and         #
(^Gray^) ; he only ask'd me how I
liked my Lord (^North^) and (^Gray^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Liked his Lordship, for what?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] That was all.
   [$Mr. (^Reeve.^) $] Had you any Talk with him about the Person    #
that was to have the
chief Command?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes; but he never named the Person.
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $] Had you never any Discourse who was to command #
the Party that
was to seize my Lord (^Cadogan^) ?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I was to command that Party.
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $] Was you any other time at my Lord (^North^)    #
and (^Gray's^) ?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes; another time I went to my Lord (^North^)    #
and (^Gray's^) , where I found
Mr. (^Layer^) , and express'd to Mr. (^Layer^) the Uneasiness I was  #
in at the long Delay,
and that I was afraid our Hopes would vanish; and told him, if       #
things were not
soon put in Execution, I would withdraw myself. Mr. (^Layer^) bid me #
not be
uneasy, Things might perhaps be sooner put in Execution than I       #
imagined.
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $]  Where was this?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] At (^Epping^) , at my Lord (^North^) and         #
(^Gray's^) .
   [$Mr. (^West.^) $] Did you come home together?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No; I came home that Night: Mr. (^Layer^)        #
remained there.

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 54>
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] I don't know whether your Lordship will    #
indulge us to ask the
Witness a Question or two now.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Jus.^) $] Propose your Questions, and we will tell you.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Whether he hath any Offer of Pardon        #
propos'd to him to induce
him to give Evidence against the Prisoner at the Bar; which if he    #
hath, we
apprehend will invalidate his Evidence
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No, Sir; I have no Promise of Pardon at all: I   #
only do this out of
Justice, to make what Reparation I can, and to save the Blood of many
People.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] I beg Leave to ask him a few more          #
Questions. I think you say
the first time you were introduced into this Gentleman's Company,    #
the Prisoner
at the Bar was at the (^Griffin-Tavern^) in (^Holborn^) , and that   #
he then told you he had
great Designs in hand; and that there was an Insurrection design'd,  #
and they
wanted a Person of Resolution to seize a General: This, you say, was #
the first
Time that ever you saw the Prisoner at the Bar. How came you to have #
that
Share of Confidence in a Man that you never saw before?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I told you I was in Discourse with Dr.           #
(^Murphey^) a great many Days and
Weeks before I saw Mr. (^Layer^) ; I told you how every Day I saw    #
him, and always
discours'd about the Insurrection, and how he told me then that he   #
would
recommend me to a Man that had the Management of the greatest Part   #
in this
Affair; and I ask'd every Day when I should be introduced to him: He #
told me,
the Time was not come yet; but when it was a proper time, he would   #
introduce
me.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] I think you give that for a Reason, why    #
you had that 
Confidence in him, because you had been recommended by one Dr.       #
(^Murphey^) . How
came you to have that mighty Dependance on Dr. (^Murphey^) ?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Because Dr. (^Murphey^) and I had been           #
acquainted several Years ago.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] I hope you was not in any wicked Design    #
with Dr. (^Murphey^) ,
and so much acquainted, as to recommend you in a Case of Treason.
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] There was a common Friendship between us.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] How came he to trust you? Would you have   #
trusted him in a
Business of Treason?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] We have been concerned in Affairs together.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] How long was you at the (^Green Man^) with #
Mr. (^Layer^) ?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I can't say exactly the Time.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] I don't ask you exactly to a Minute or     #
two; but was you there
an Hour, or two, or three Hours?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I can't say whether we were there an Hour or     #
two; but we had
something dress'd for Dinner, and the Matter was discours'd of by us #
before
Dinner.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] When you first alighted from your Horses,  #
what Room was
you shewn into?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] We were shewn into a Room up one Pair of Stairs  #
on the right-hand,
the first Room?
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Was it towards the Street, or backwards?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] It look'd into the common Road.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did you look out of the Window and see a   #
Person of your
Acquaintance?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I saw two Gentlemen, but did not know them.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did not you look out of the Window, and    #
say, you saw a
Gentleman of your Acquaintance?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I said I saw two Gentlemen that I thought I had  #
seen before.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did not you go down to those Gentlemen?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No; I did not go down to them.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did not you go down to them?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No. 
<P 55>
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did not you say so to Mr. (^Layer^) , in   #
the Drawer's Presence?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did not you tell me that those Gentlemen were #
your Acquaintance?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I told you, those two Gentlemen I had seen before.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] How long were we together at the 
(^Green-Man^) ? Were the Horses
put up, or not?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I can't tell.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Was there any thing dress'd for our Dinner    #
but a Beef-stake?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No, nothing else.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did not you go down Stairs, pretending you    #
went to those
Gentlemen?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No, I did not tell you I went to those Gentlemen.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you not go down Stairs?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, I did; and came up again immediately.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Was not Dinner on Table when you came up again?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I went down twice before Dinner.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Then you must consequently leave me in the    #
Room.
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I went down to make Water.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] What did you go down the second time for?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Out of Curiosity.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] How long did you stay?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Not both times above two Minutes.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I was then alone, when you went down?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Was this Discourse before or after Dinner?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] It was before Dinner.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] When you came up the second Time, was not     #
Dinner on the 
Table?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] It was come up.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] And yet the Discourse we had was before Dinner?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Yes, it was before Dinner.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] How much Time might we spend before Dinner,   #
half an Hour, or
an Hour?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I don't remember; but it was a good while.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Was not the double Barrel Gun in the Room?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I don't know whether it was there, or whether    #
your Servant had it.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] At the Time of Dinner, was my Servant, or     #
Drawer, in the
Room?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] Neither of them was in the Room.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] You say we were a good while, you and I,      #
alone; pray, how
long?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] I cannot say positively how long.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Have you any Copy of that Part of the    #
Paper he gave you
to read, and which you read?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Was the Whole of it of any Length?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] To the best of my Remembrance, it was a common   #
Sheet of Paper.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Did you read the Whole?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No: He doubled it down, and gave me the latter   #
Part of it to read.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Some Things you seem to remember, and some #
Things you don't
remember: Was it printed, or written?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] It was written.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did he not mention it to be the Prince of  #
(^Orange's^)
Declaration?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] No, he did not.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Was not the Paper blotted?
   [$ (^Lynch.^) $] In that I saw there were two or three Places     #
interlined.  
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] My Lord, I think the Gentlemen did say   #
they had not done
with their Evidence, with relation to an Overt-Act in (^Essex^) ; if #
they have not,
they will do well to go on now: But we hope they shall not go into   #
Overt-Acts
committed in any other County, till they make the whole of their     #
Proofs of an
Overt-Act in (^Essex^) .
   [$ (^L. Ch. Jus.^) $] You have been told, they should proceed in  #
their own Method,
<P 56>
and when they have done, you may make what Observations may be of    #
Service to
your Client.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Relations of Fact arising in another     #
County, which have no
Relation to the Fact arising in (^Essex^) , we hope they shall not   #
go into, to amuse
or captivate the Jury, the Court, and the Auditory.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Jus.^) $] Sure never any Thing was like this! It is  #
our Province to give
Directions, and we think it not proper to interrupt the King's       #
Counsel, but that
they should proceed in their own Method: You shall be heard as long  #
as you
please, when you come to make your Observations.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] The Prisoner hath a Right to say any      #
thing that is proper, to
the Court and the Jury, in his Defence, but he must say it openly;   #
he is not to
talk privately with the Jury; though I am sure they are Gentlemen    #
of so great
Worth and Honour, as not to be influenced.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] I dare say the Jury won't be influenced;   #
but he talks to his
Counsel so loud, that the Jury may easily hear every Word he says.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Jus.^) $] He must not speak so loud.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] I just now heard him say, It was strange   #
to go on with
Evidence that would not be to the Purpose. I heard him, as I sate    #
here; let him
deny it if he can.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Jus.^) $] I hope you will not offer any thing of that #
Kind, Mr. (^Layer^) :
You have a Right to discourse with your Counsel, but you must do it  #
in such a
Manner as the Jury may not hear.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Indeed, my Lord, he shall have no        #     
Encouragement from us
for any such Conduct.
[$ (^Matthew Plunkett^) sworn.$] 
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Tell my Lord and the Jury, whether   #
you know the
Prisoner at the Bar.
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes, I do know him.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Will you tell my Lord and the Jury,  #
upon what Account,
and by whose Means, you first became acquainted?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] One Major (^Barnewell^) brought me first      #
acquainted with Mr. (^Layer^) ;
he had an Execution in his House in (^Great Queen's-street^) , and   #
this Major (^Barnewell^)
came to me, and desired me to get a Couple of Grenadiers. I brought  #
him two;
we went to Mr. (^Layer's^) House, and his Clerk let us in at the     #
Back-door, and the
Grenadiers turned the Officers out, and Mr. (^Layer^) gave them a    #
Crown, and a
Glass of Brandy.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] When was this?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] As near as I can guess, it is going on of     #
five Years.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Tell my Lord and the Jury, what      #
Month in this last
Year you renewed the Acquaintance, and who brought you to him?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] The next Acquaintance I had afterwards, was   #
by Major (^Barnewell^) ,
who was arrested, and he sent me with a Letter to his House, to      #
desire him to
relieve him.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Do you know any thing of one (^James #
Plunkett^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes: He came to me from Mr. (^Layer^) , in    #
(^July^) last, to desire me to
meet him; but how this Counsellor (^Layer^) and this (^James         #
Plunkett^) came
acquainted I don't know.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] What was he?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I don't know what he is; he is acquainted     #
with Mr. (^Layer^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] What Profession is he of?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I don't know; nor how he lives, or gets his   #
Bread.
   [$ (^L. Ch. Jus.^) $] Go on.
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Mr. (^Layer^) paid the Charges for Major      #
(^Barnewell^) , and brought him
out of the (^Marshalsea^) .
   [$Mr. (^Reeve.^) $] How long was this ago?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] To the best of my Knowledge, four Years ago.

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 60>
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] For what Purpose was (^Child^)       #
recommended to Mr. (^Layer^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I recommended him as an honest Man, as one    #
that was 
well-affected, as he desired me.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Upon what Account did you recommend  #
him?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Upon the Account to be a Pretender's Man.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Did you ever receive any Money to    #
give to Mr. (^Child^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I receiv'd half a Guinea from Mr. (^Layer^)   #
to give to Mr. (^Child^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] For what Purpose was it?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] For to encourage him in the Service, to be    #
trusty to him, and to be
a Pretender's Man.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] By what Name did he call the         #
Pretender?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] He called him the King.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Had you any Talk with him any other  #
Time?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] The (^Sunday^) before he was taken up I was   #
with him, and he was
talking and saying the King was as fine a Shooter as any in          #
(^Europe^) .
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Whom did he mean by the King?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] The Pretender, that he was as fine a Shooter  #
as any in (^Europe^) ; he
shot nineteen out of twenty. I said, that was fine shooting.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Where was this Discourse?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] In his own Parlour.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Can you recollect any other Discourse      #
there was at that Time,
besides that of shooting?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes, there was; we talk'd of those Men that   #
would do Service. I
ask'd him what Rewards those Men, that would do Service for their    #
King and
Country, should have; he told me, that they, and their Families,     #
were to be
for ever taken Care of.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Was there any other Promise made to  #
you?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] There was no Promise; only he was the Man who #
said, if I would
follow his Directions, he would promote me; that he would engage to  #
do great
Matters for me; and what I suffer'd in the Army, he would make me    #
Amends for.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Had you any Discourse about the      #
Disposition of the Nation?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] He said, that most of the Nation was tir'd    #
with the present
Government; and he said, that King (^George^) was for ruining of the #
Nation.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Had you any Talk of any Persons at   #
Court?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes; he said, what signified the Government;  #
there were but only
eight or nine Upstarts that belong'd to King (^George's^) Court;     #
that the ancient
Peers of the Realm would not be run down; for they should be made    #
Slaves, if
they did not prevent it.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Pengelly.^) $] Had you any Discourse any other Time #
about the
(^Dutch^) or the (^French^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes; I do remember that he said, here is a    #
(^Dutch^) Army come in
upon this Nation, and then the (^French^) Army will come in, and     #
take our Rights and
Liberties from us: You will keep a (^Dutch^) Army, and it will be to #
make a War
among our selves.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] What would he have to cure all this?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] He told me, that when the Insurrection was,   #
there would be a great
many Half-pay-Officers as I knew that would be on the Pretender's    #
Side, and 
especially those of the Names of (^Fitzgerald^) ; but I never knew   #
any (^Fitzgerald^) 
Abroad.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] We have done examinining this Witness.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] You say your first Acquaintance with me was   #
in (^Queen's-street^) , and
that Major (^Barnwell^) desir'd you to assist me, there being an     #
Execution in my
House; was it not so?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] At the same Time you called me Counsellor     #
(^Layer^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes; I came to your House.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did I employ you?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Major (^Barnwell^) sent me to get a Couple of #
Grenadiers, and you
ordered your Clerk to let them in at the Back-door; and the two      #
Grenadiers,
which were confin'd in the (^Savoy^) afterwards for it, drove the    #
Officers out.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Was it the Landlord of the House's Goods, or  #
my Goods?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I cannot tell; how should I know whether they #
were yours, or
his? they were in your House.
<P 61>
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] You said it was about Five Years before I saw #
you in
(^Lincolns-Inn-Fields^) .
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] It was when the Army was broke; and I came    #
over from (^Ireland^) .
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Well, you say, Five Years afterwards I met    #
you in 
(^Lincolns-Inn-Fields^) ,
and gave you Half-a-Crown to drink. I told you my Lord (^North^) and
(^Grey^) was to be General: That my Lord (^Strafford^) was concern'd #
in it.  
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] No; you told me they were Promoters of it.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Promoters of what?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Of this Conspiracy.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] So you did not know me; nor I did not know you.
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes, you knew me; therefore, Sir, said I, you #
have an Advantage
against me; for I don't know you. Afterwards we met one another by
Accident. Says you, Don't tell (^Plunkett^) you met me.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] What (^Plunkett^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] (^James Plunkett.^) 
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Where lives (^James Plunkett^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I don't know: However, that's not material.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did not you come to my House some time after  #
this; and desire  
me to lend you 13 (^s.^) upon Account of being Bail in an Action in  #
the (^Marshal's^)
Court?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] That was Two Months after: There was a        #
Soldier which was
arrested by a (^Marshal's-Court^) Writ. 
[^NO ITALICS FOR Court IN SOURCE TEXT.^] 
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] And I lent you 13 (^s.^) in order to          #
discharge him?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes, you did.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did not you afterwards ask me for some Money  #
on Account of Sir
(^Daniel Carroll^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did not you make a Demand on Sir (^Daniel^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] No: I told you my Affairs with Sir            #
(^Daniel^) . You said you would
not meddle your self, but you would write to him.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you not bring a Paper, and say, Sir       #
(^Daniel^) had agreed to pay
you (^20l.^) [^NO ITALICS FOR 20 IN SOURCE TEXT^] when he receiv'd   #
his Pay?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] No; I brought no Papers to you.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did not you tell me, it would be the greatest #
Kindness in the World
to you to advance 20 (^s.^) for you?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I never ask'd you in the Course of my Life.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you never borrow any Money of me?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] No; I never borrowed any Money of you,        #
otherwise that to get
Men lifted for the Pretender.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] I shall shew that you are a little mistaken   #
by and by.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] You said, you was decoy'd to Church?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Decoy'd! I said it was out of my Way, when my #
own Parish
Church was nearer.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] What, do you use to go to Church?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] You say, the first Time you saw this       #
(^James Plunkett^) , he came
to you when your Wife was in the Room?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] The first Time I saw him, was, when Mr.       #
(^Layer^) releas'd Major
(^Barnewell^) out of the (^Marshalsea^) .
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] When (^James Plunkett^) came to your       #
House, he took you by the
Arm, and told you, he came from Mr. (^Layer^) ; Did he tell you that #
first Time,
he came from Mr. (^Layer^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Upon my Oath he did.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] What Discourse had you the first Time? Did #
he only ask you
to go and meet Mr. (^Layer^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] He came to me, and desired me to meet Mr.     #
(^Layer^) at the (^Italian^)
Coffee-House in (^Russel-Court^) .
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did (^James Plunkett^) talk to you about   #
lifting Men for the
Pretender the first Time he saw you?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] No; he only was sent on an Errand from Mr.    #
(^Layer^) .
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] And then you came to the Nonjuring Parson: #
The Unjuring
Parson, as you call him. What Discourse had you with him?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] The same Discourse pass'd between us about    #
lifting Men.
<P 62>
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] What, the first Time you saw (^James       #
Plunkett^) , and the first
Time you saw the Nonjuring Parson?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Because he came from Mr. (^Layer^) .
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] So you trusted both of 'em at first Sight, #
and talked to 'em
about lifting Men for the Pretender.
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Yes, both talked to me.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] How many times had this Unjuring Parson    #
been with you,
before you knew his Name?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] He had been with me two or three times; he    #
told me his Name was
(^Jeffreys^) , but did not tell me his Christian Name.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] Did he tell you his Name was (^Jeffreys^) #
the first time?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] He told me his Name was (^Jeffreys^) .
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] How long after was it that this Letter    #
was sent to you by
Mr. (^Jeffreys^) ?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] It was the Time when Mr. (^Layer^) came from  #
the Country.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] How long ago was that?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I believe about ten Months ago: I mean ten    #
Weeks ago.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] I wou'd not surprize you; I wou'd have you #
consider you are
upon your Oath: Is it ten Months, or ten Weeks?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Ten Weeks.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] How come you to remember the Contents of   #
the Letter so
exactly?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I heard it repeated over.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Pray repeat it over again.
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Mr. (^Plunkett^) , Mr. (^Layer^) is come to   #
Town; I shou'd be very glad to
see you: So I rest your humble Servant, (^William Jeffreys^) .
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Where is that Letter?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I don't know; the Letter is lost.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Do you remember how long 'tis since this   #
Letter was lost?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] Why, I miss'd it about two Months ago, or more.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Two Months ago, or more. How long was      #
it after you receiv'd
it that you miss'd it?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I kept the Letter in my Pocket some time.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] How long?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I believe I had it three Weeks.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] So that 'tis ten Weeks since you receiv'd  #
this Letter, two Months
since you lost it; you kept it in your Pocket three Weeks: You can   #
read
Writing?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] No, I cannot.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] What, not read Writing?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] No, Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] How can you be so particular as to the     #
Writing?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I have heard it read often enough.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Who read it to you?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] (^John Child^) read it over to me two or      #
three times.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Why, this is mere Romance, that at twice   #
hearing it read, you
can remember it, the very Words.
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] I can remember those Words, to the best of my #
Knowledge.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] How can he tell, when he cannot read at  #
all? There is
nothing in it. If one was to ask him, whether can you recite the     #
Articles of the
Creed, I believe he cou'd not do it; and yet is so exact in          #
repeating the Words of
this Letter.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] What Countryman are you?
   [$ (^Plunkett.^) $] An (^Irishman^) : You knew that long ago; you #
need not ask me that
Question now.

[$ (^Mrs.^) Elizabeth Mason (^sworn^) .$]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Mason^) , Give an Account of what   #
you know of these
Papers?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Mr. (^Layer^) left two Parcels of Papers     #
with me: He told me they
were of the Value of 500 (^l.^) He afterwards took them away from    #
me; and 
afterwards brought them to me again.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] You say, he deliver'd two Bundles    #
first?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No; he deliver'd only one, and that was the  #
largest Bundle: 
He told me it was of the Value of (^500l.^)                          #
[^NO ITALICS FOR 500 IN SOURCE TEXT^] and desir'd me to take care of #
it, and
lock it up.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] When was the lesser Bundle deliver'd #
to you?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Some time after; and after than, he took     #
them away from me;
and in four or five Days time he brought them to me again: He took   #
them away,
and brought them to me again, and told me they were a few            #
Love-Letters; and
begg'd of me not to let Mrs. (^Cook^) know it, for she would make a  #
Disturbance,
and tell his Wife.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] When had you the lesser Bundle?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] I had that some time after.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] What Directions had you with the     #
little Bundle?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] He desired me to take the same Care of that, #
as of the other.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Was that seal'd up?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] They were both seal'd.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Where did you put them?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] I put them into my Trunk.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] After this; you know when the        #
Messengers came?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Before that, he came one Day in the          #
Afternoon to our House,
and ask'd where I was. It was the Beginning of                       #
(^Bartholomew-tide^) . I was not at
home: He left a Message for me, that I shou'd bring those Writings   #
home. I
carry'd them home.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Home! what do you mean by home?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Mr. (^Layer's^) own House: He left word,     #
that he wou'd be at home
by Eight a-Clock that Night. I was there about Eight a-Clock: I      #
asked the
Maid where he was? She said he was in the Back-Parlour. I asked her  #
if any
body was with him? She said there were two Gentlemen. Said I, Tell   #
your
Master that I am here.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] You say, the great Bundle was taken from  #
you again, and
afterwards he brought the lesser Bundle; and after this you receiv'd #
a Message, or
Intimation, that you shou'd bring home that Bundle?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] My Lord, I had Two Bundles. He left word,    #
that I should
bring his Papers Home; for he stay'd at Home till Eight-a-Clock that #
Night. I
went to his House: And when I knock'd at the Door, the Maid came to  #
the Door.
I ask'd her, if her Master was within? she told me, Yes; he was in   #
the back
<P 66>
Parlour; and that there was a Gentleman or Two with him. I desir'd   #
her to go
and tell her Master that I was there. And he came out to me; and I   #
gave him
the Writings; and he desired me to come again the next Morning; which
was on a (^Saturday^) , about Eleven-a-Clock, for he was going out of
Town: And that I would come and take those Writings again. Which
accordingly I did. It was in the Morning, at the Time that the Bell  #
was ringing
at (^Lincolns-Inn^) Chapel, when I went to him, and he deliver'd me  #
the Papers again.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Can you recollect the Day that he left    #
Word for you to come
to him?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] It was the Beginning of (^Bartholomew-tide^) .
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] What Day of the Week was it?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] It was on a (^Friday^) Night that I went and #
carried them to his House.    
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] And when was it that he desired you would #
come and call for
them again?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] It was the next Morning at Eleven-a-Clock,   #
or near the Matter,
that I went to his House; and he gave me the Writings again, and     #
charged me
to take Care of them.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] What was you to do with them?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] To take care of them.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Did you meddle with them, or open    #
them?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, Sir; I put them in my Trunk: They lay    #
there all the time.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Were they there when the Officers    #
came?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes, Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Was you there when the Bundles were  #
opened?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] I was there.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Did you mark the Papers your self?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] I did.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Look upon the Papers, and see if you #
find your Mark on
those Papers?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes, this is my Mark.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Mr. (^Speare^) , you was present at  #
the opening of them?
   [$Mr. (^Speare.^) $] I was. They were sealed up when I opened them.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Did you put your Name on them?
   [$Mr. (^Speare.^) $] I did put my Name on them.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Were they out of your Custody before #
you put your Name
on them?
   [$Mr. (^Speare.^) $] No; they were not.
   [$Mr. (^Serj. Cheshyre.^) $] Did Mr. (^Turner^) put his Name to   #
them?
   [$Mr. (^Speare.^) $] He put his Name to them, before ever they    #
were out of my Custody.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] You have mark'd all those Papers. You are  #
sure those are the
Papers you took out of the Trunk in Mrs. (^Mason's^) Lodging?
   [$Mr. (^Speare.^) $] I am sure they are.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Shew them to Mrs. (^Mason^) . Mrs.         #
(^Mason^) , were those Papers in
the Bundles that were deliver'd to you by Mr. (^Layer^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes, Sir; they were.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] You have mark'd those Papers, have you not?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes, I have.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] You said, you gave the Bundles back to    #
Mr. (^Layer^) on a (^Friday^) ,   
about the Beginning of (^Bartholomew-tide^) . Do you remember        #
whether it was
upon (^Bartholomew-Day^) [^NO ITALICS FOR Day IN SOURCE TEXT^] or not?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Indeed I don't know.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] What did Mr. (^Layer^) say, when you      #
brought them to him again?   
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] He only thank'd me; and desired me to come   #
the next Day and
take them from him again: Which I did.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Did he mention then, that he was going    #
out of Town?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes: And it was about Eleven-a-Clock on a    #
(^Saturday^) Morning
that I went to him, and he deliver'd the Papers to me again. 
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Can you write?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No. 
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Have you made the same Mark on all those #
Papers?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] I was so frightned at that time, that I      #
hardly knew what Mark I made.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] If you was frightned at that time, and   #
did not know what
Mark you made, how can you be sure you know your Mark again?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes, I can tell it very well.
<P 67>
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] When you say you was so frighted you did #
not know what
Mark you made?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes, sure I do.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Upon the Oath you have taken, hath any   #
Body seen those
Papers before they were taken by the Messengers; whether Sir (^John  #
Meeres^) , or
his Man (^Thomas^) hath seen them?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Nor his Man (^Thomas^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, nor his Man (^Thomas^) .
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] I ask you, Can you write or can you read   #
Writing?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] I told you I can't.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] You only can make your Mark?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Do you only make but one Mark, or use      #
several Marks?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] I make but one Mark.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Pray make the Mark you generally use? With #
Submission, my
Lord, I desire she may have a Pen and Ink to see if she can make the #
same Mark
again.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] Surely we are regular in desiring that?
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] What you desire is proper. She says she   #
knows them to be the
same Papers, because she hath set her Mark upon them; they doubt     #
whether she
may mistake in her Mark, and desire she may make her Mark again.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] My Lord, we desire that she may make her   #
Mark again.
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] We desire she may have a convenient Place #
to do it in, and
that she may sit down while she writes?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, I can do it without. [$ ( (^A Pen and    #
Ink and Paper is given to her, 
and she sets her Mark an^) E (^and an^) M.) $]
   [$Mr. (^Soll. Gen.^) $] Here are the Letters (^E^) and (^M^) set  #
to the Papers produc'd; and
tho' in this Confusion she should not make her Letters exactly like  #
those, yet I
apprehend that would weigh very little.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, I can't tell what they mean; this #
doth not
depend --
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] My Lord, I desire to go on with our        #
Questions. [^SOURCE TEXT: Question.s^] I ask you --
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] [$ ( (^Having compared the Letters made   #
by Mrs.^) Mason (^in Court, with
those on the Papers^) ) $] The Character which she now writes is     #
like what she writ on
those Papers, and so confirms her Evidence.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] After the delivery of those Bundles to you #
by Mr. (^Layer^) , I ask
you whether Sir (^John Meeres's^) Man (^Thomas^) ever saw those      #
Bundles open'd?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, he never was up in my Room; there was no #
such
Familiarity between us.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did one (^Wilson^) ever see them?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did ever you produce them to one (^Binks^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] No? Nor did Sir (^John Meeres's^) Man         #
(^Thomas^) never see them?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, never upon my Oath.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Did you ever produce them sealed up? Did   #
you ever let (^Thomas^)
or (^William^) , [^SOURCE TEXT HAS TWO COMMAS^] or Sir               #
(^John Meeres^) himself see either of those Bundles as they were
sealed up?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, they were in my Trunk: I always kept     #
them in my
Trunk; perhaps as I open'd my Trunk, they might see them lie in my   #
Trunk.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Do you know one Mrs. (^Buda^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No. I don't know the Name. I don't know one  #
Mrs. (^Buda^) .
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you ever know one Mrs. (^Herbert^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] I know many of that Name.
   [[$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you ever go by that Name?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No.

   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you ever go by the Name of (^Bevan^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, I never did go by the Name of (^Bevan^) .
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] Mr. (^Ketelbey^) , I don't know what the  #
Meaning of this
Examination is; when it appears beyond Contradiction, that this      #
Woman was an
Acquaintance of your Client's.
<P 68>
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] My Lord, if we prove her to be an ill      #
Woman, I hope it will
take off her Credit so that her Evidence will not weigh with your    #
Lordship, or
the Jury.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] At the Time when these Bundles were       #
seized, had they
Mr. (^Layer's^) Seal upon them?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes. The Seal of Mr. (^Layer^) was upon them.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] What says the Messenger? At the Time that #
you seized these Two
Bundles of Papers, was there any Seal upon them?
   [$ (^Messenger.^) $] There were Three Seals upon one, and some    #
Seals upon the other;
the Seal was something of a small Head.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] What is Mr. (^Layer's^) Seal?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Something of a Head, but I can't tell what   #
Head.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Do you know Mr. (^Layer's^) Seal?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes. It is something of a Head.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Was it the Representation of a Man's Head, #
or the Head of
a Beast?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] It is a Head, with something of a Ruff about #
it.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Jus.^) $] Mrs. (^Mason^) , look upon the Head. Is    #
that Head the Seal of
Mr. (^Layer^) .
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Yes. Upon my Oath it is.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Jus.^) $] What says the Messenger. Was that Seal of  #
a Head upon them,
when you seized them?
   [$ (^Messenger.^) $] Yes, It was.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] Before that Time that the Two Messengers   #
came, Mr. (^Turner^)
and Mr. (^Speare^) , and seiz'd the Papers, and afterwards one of    #
them went for
Mr. (^Stanyan^) ; I ask you, Whether you had shown those Bundles to  #
any Body
before that Time?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No; I had shown them to no Body.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] She hath said so Two or Three Times before.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] Indeed, Mr. (^Ketelbey^) , we must direct #
you not to spend the Time    
of the Court so. You have ask'd her that Question Two or Three Times #
over.
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] My Lord, I would very fain have the Truth  #
come out.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I will ask you a Question or Two. What   #
Trade or Business
do you follow? What is your Trade or Occupation.
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] What is that to you? I have no Trade.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] I should have ask'd you another Question #
before; Have you
not a Promise of Reward for the Service you do here, in giving this  #
Evidence?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, I have not.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Nor you have received none?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No. You are an unjust Man.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] Are you promised any Reward! Why don't    #
you ask her whether
she is to swear for Hire? Is that a proper Question to ask a Witness?
   [$Mr. (^Ketelbey.^) $] I submit it to your Lordship, whether it   #
is not proper to ask
her this Question; Whether she hath not told any Person, and whom,   #
that she
was to have a Reward for coming hither?
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] The Question is, Whether she hath never owned #
and confessed to
any Body, that these Papers were opened before a Friend of hers,     #
before the
Messenger seized them?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No, my Lord, I never did. I never opened     #
them before any Body.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] They have ask'd you what Names you went    #
by; Do you know
what Names the Prisoner at the Bar has gone by?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] He had once given me Orders, that if any     #
Letter came directed in
the Name of (^Fountaine^) , that I should take it in, accordingly in #
Two or Three
Days Time, there came a Letter, directed to Mr. (^Fountaine^) , and  #
I took it in;
and when he came I gave it to him, and he opened it, and read it.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Where is your House?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] Where! where you left the Writings.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] How can you tell how that Letter was          #
directed, which you took in
since you say you cannot Read?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] It was directed to Mr. (^Fountaine^) .
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] Did you read the Superscription?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No. Mrs. (^Cook^) did. 
<P 69>
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] You say you was desired by Mr.            #
(^Layer^) , when any Letter came
directed to Mr. (^Fountaine^) , to take it in; and that a Letter     #
came directed to
Mr. (^Fountaine^) , and you took it in. The Question is asked you,   #
since you cannot
read, how could you tell it was directed to Mr. (^Fountaine^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] My Landlady told me it was for Mr.           #
(^Fountaine^) , and she knew he
went by the Name of (^Fountaine^) sometimes.
   [$ (^Prisoner.^) $] She said she read it.
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] No. I said I gave it to you, and you open'd  #
it, and you read it.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] The Occasion of this Question is, that    #
this (^Misnomer^) was
approved of by you. She says that you order'd her, that if any       #
Letter came directed
to Mr. (^Fountaine^) , she should take it in; a Letter did come      #
directed so, she took it
in, and then deliver'd it to you; and you receiv'd it from her, and  #
open'd and
read it; but how, say they, cou'd you know this Letter was directed  #
to Mr.
(^Fountaine^) , when you can neither write nor read? She having      #
receiv'd such an Order,
when there was a Letter come, it was natural enough, that she that   #
cou'd not
read, should ask her Landlady the Directions of the Letter, and it   #
was directed
for (^Fountaine^) ; it was natural enough for her to take it in, and #
give it to you.
   Who brought the Letter?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] A Porter.
   [$ (^Ld. Ch. Just.^) $] Did he say from whence he came?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] He told me he came from the (^Ditch-Side^) , #
and ask'd me if
Mr. (^Fountaine^) lodg'd there.
   [$Mr. (^Hungerford.^) $] This Trunk that the Papers were in, did  #
it use to be kept
open, or was it lock'd up?
   [$Mrs. (^Mason.^) $] It was always lock'd up.
