[}ACT. III.}]

[$Enter Sir (^Edward Hartfort, Belfort^) and (^Doubty^) .$]

   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] You have extreamly delighted us this morning, by #
your House, Gardens, 
your Accomodation, and your way of Living; you put me in mind
of the renowned (^Sidneys^) Admirable description of (^Kalandar^) .
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Sir you Complement me too much.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Methinks you represent to us the Golden 'days of  #
Queen (^Elizabeth^) , such sure 
were our Gentry then; now they are grown Servile Apes to Forreign    #
customes, they
leave off Hospitality, for which we were famous all over             #
(^Europe^) , and turn Servants
to Board-wages.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] For my part, I love to have my Servants part of #
my Family, the other
were to hire day Labourers to wait on me; I had rather my Friends,   #
Kindred, 
Tennants and Servants should live well out of me, than Coach-makers, #
Taylors, 
Embroiderers, and Lacemen should: To be pointed at in the Streets,   #
and have Fools stare 
at my Equipage, is a vanity I have always scorn'd.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] You speak like one descended from those Noble    #
Ancestors that made (^France^) 
tremble, and all the rest of (^Europe^) Honour 'em.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] I reverence the Memory of 'em: But our          #
New-fashion'd Gentry love the 
(^French^) too well to fight against 'em; they are bred abroad       #
without knowing any thing 
of our Constitution, and come home tainted with Foppery, slavish     #
Principles, and 
Popish Religion.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] They bring home Arts of Building from hot         #
Countries to serve for our cold
one; and Frugality from those places where they have little Meat and #
small Stomacks, 
to suffice us who have great plenty and lusty Appetites.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] They build Houses with Halls in 'em, not so big as
former Porches; 
Beggers were better entertained by their Ancestors, than their       #
Tennants by them.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] For my part, I think 'twas never good days, but #
when great Tables were 
kept in large Halls; the Buttery-hatch always open, Black Jacks, and #
a good smell 
of Meat and March-beer, with Dogs-turds and Mary-bones as Ornaments  #
in the 
Hall: These were signs of good House keeping, I hate to see          #
(^Italian^) fine Buildings 
with no Meat or Drink in 'em.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] I like not their little Plates, methinks there's  #
Vertue in an English Sur-loyn.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] Our Sparks bring nothing but Forreign Vices and  #
Follies home; 'tis 
rediculous to be bred in one Country to learn to live in another.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] While we lived thus (to borrow a Coxcombly      #
word) we made a better 
Figure in the World.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] You have a mind that suits your Fortune, and can  #
make your own 
happiness.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] The greatest is the Enjoyment of my Friends,    #
and such Worthy Gentlemen 
<P 30>
as your Selves, and when I cannot have enough of that; I have a      #
Library, good 
Horses and good Musick.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] Princes may envy such an English Gentleman.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] You are too kind, (^I am a true English-man, I  #
love the Princes Rights and 
Peoples Liberties, and will defend 'em both with the last penny in   #
my purse, and the last drop 
in my veins, and dare defy the witless Plots of Papists^) .
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Spoken like a Noble Patriot.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Pardon me, you talk like English-men, and you   #
have warm'd me; I hope 
to see the Prince and People flourish yet; old as I am, in spite of  #
Jesuits, I am sure our 
Constitution is the Noblest in the World.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] Would there were enough such English Gentlemen.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] 'Twere to be wisht; but our Gentry are so much    #
poysoned with Forreign 
Vanities, that methinks the Genius of (^England^) seems sunk into    #
the Yeomanry.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] We have indeed too many rotten Members. You     #
speak like Gentlemen, 
Worthy of such Noble Fathers, as you both had; but Gentlemen I spoke #
of Musick, 
I see two of my Artists, come into the Garden, they shall entertain  #
you with a Song 
this Morning.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Sir You oblige us every way.
[$ (^An Italian Song.^) $] 
Finely compos'd, and excellently perform'd.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] I see Sir you are well serv'd in every thing.

[$Enter (^Isabella^) and (^Theodosia^) .$] 

   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] My sweet Cousin good Morrow to thee, I hope to  #
call thee shortly by 
another Name, my dear Child, Heaven's bless thee.                    #
[$ (^Isab. Kneels.^) $] 
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Ladies your most humble Servant; you are early up #
to take the pleasure of 
the Morning in these Gardens.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] 'Tis a Paradice you are in; every object within  #
this place is ravishing.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] This place affords variety of Pleasures; nothing  #
here is wanting.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Where such fine Ladies are.
 
[$ (^Enter Servant with^) Teague O Devilly (^an Irish-Priest^) .$]

   [$ (^Serv.^) $] A Gentleman, To speak with you.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] With me! Daughter pray shew those Gentlemen the #
Statues, Grottoes 
and the Water-works, I'le [^SOURCE TEXT: I le^] wait on you          #
immediately.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] This is an opportunity beyond our hopes.          #
[$ (^Ex. Bell. Doubt. Isab. Theo.^) $]
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Would you speak with me? 
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] Arrah, and please ty Oorship, I am come here to #
dis plaash to maake a 
wisitt unto thee, dest dou not know me Joy?
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Oh! You live at Mr. (^Redletters^) my Catholick #
Neighbours.
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] Ah by my Shoul, I.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] How came you to venture hither? you are a       #
Popish-Priest.
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] Ay, but 'tis no matter for all daat Joy: by my  #
Shoul, but I vill taak de 
<P 31>
Oades, and I think I vill be excus'd, but hark vid you a while, by   #
my trott I shall 
be a Paapist too for all daat, indeed, yes.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Excellent Principles.
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] I do come for de nonest to see dee, and yet I   #
do not come one purpose 
gra: But it is no matter, I will talk vid you aboot daat, I do come  #
upon occaasion
and Mr. (^Redletter^) did shend me unto dee.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] For What?
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] What will I say unto dee now, but Mr.           #
(^Redletter^) did shend me, and yet I did 
come off my self too for all daat upon occaasion, daat I did heare,  #
concerning of dee, 
dat dy House and de Plaash is all over-run with Witches and Spirits, #
do you see 
now?
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] I had best let this Fool stay to laugh at him,  #
he may be out of the damn'd 
Plot, if any Priest was? Sure they would never trust this Fool.      #
[$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] What shaall you shay unto me upon all dis, I    #
will exorcize doze Vitches, and 
I will plague dose Devils now by my Shoul, vid Holy-water, and vid   #
Reliques, and 
I will freet 'em out of this Plaash, God shaave the King.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] I have forgot your Name.
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] They do put the Name of (^Kelly^) upon me, Joy, #
but by my fait I am call'd 
by my own right Name, (^Tegue O Devilly^) .
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] (^Tegue O Devilly?^)
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] Yes, a very oold Naam in (^Eereland^) by my     #
Shalvaation, well gra, I have [^SOURCE TEXT: wel l gra, Ihave^] 
brought upon my Cloke-bagg shome Holy-water, and I will put it upon  #
the Devils 
and de Vitches Faashes, and I will make you shome more Holy-water,   #
and you will 
vaash all de Roomes vid it and bee -- 
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Well, Father (^Tegue O Devilly^) , You're       #
welcom; but how dare you venture 
publickly in these times?
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] Why, I have great consideraation upon dy        #
Prudence; for if dou wouldst 
betray me, now phare will be de soleedity of dat Joy.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] I speak not for my self, but others.
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] The Devil taak me now, I do think, I will       #
suffer for my Religion, I am affraid 
I will be slain at lasht at the plaash they call Saint (^Ty-burn^) , #
but I do not caare by my 
Shalvaation; for if I will be hang'd, I will be a Saint presently,   #
and all my Country 
shall pray unto Saint (^Tegue^) , besides, shome great people will   #
be naamless too, I tell 
you I shay noe more, but I will be prayed unto Joy.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Prayed too! Very well.
   [$ (^Priest.^) $] Yes by my Shoule will I, and I will have        #
Reliques maade of me too.

[$ (^Enter Servant.^) $]

   [$ (^Serv.^) $] Sir (^Jeffery Shacklehead^) and my Lady have some #
business with you, and desire 
your company within.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Come Father (^Tegue^) , come along with me, do  #
you hear, find the 
Gentlemen that are walking with my Daughter and her Couzen, and tell #
'em I will wait on 
'em presently. [$ (^Ex. Sir Edw. and Priest.^) $]
   [$ (^Serv.^) $] I will. They are here, Gentlemen, my Master is    #
called away upon business
<P 32>
[^SOURCE TEXT HAS PAGE NUMBERED 22^]
he begs your excuse, and will wait on you presently.                 #
[$ (^Ex. Serv.^) $]
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Heaven gives us yet a longer Opportunity, and     #
certainly intends we should 
make use of it; I have my own Parson that comes to hunt with me at   #
(^Whally^) , Madam, 
an excellent School Divine, that will end all differences betwixt us.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] He is like to begin 'em betwixt us, the Name of a #
Parson is a dreadful Name 
upon these occasions, he'l [^SOURCE TEXT: he l^] bring us into a     #
Condition we can never get out of, but by 
Death.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] If the absolute command of me and my Fortune can  #
please you, you shall never 
desire to get out of it.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] I should at more distance and with more          #
reverence approach you, Madam, 
did not the shortness of the time, and the great danger of losing    #
you, force me to 
be free; Throw not away this pretious time, a Minute now is          #
Inestimable.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] Yet I must consider on that Minute on which the   #
happiness or Misery of all 
my Life may depend.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] How can I imagine that you who have rambled up    #
and down the Southern 
World, should at last fix on a Home-bred Mistress in the North? how  #
can you be in 
earnest?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Consult your Understanding and your               #
Looking-Glass, one will tell you how 
Witty, Wise, and Good you are, the other, how Beautiful, how Sweet,  #
how 
Charming.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Men before they are Married turn the great end of #
their Perspective; but the 
little end after it.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] They are Men of ill Eyes, and worse               #
Understanding; but for your Perfections 
there needs no Perspective.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] If I were inclin'd to Marriage, methinks we are   #
not well enough acquainted 
yet to think of that.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] To my Reputation I suppose you are no Stranger,  #
nor to my Estate, which 
lies all in the next County; and for my Love, I will convince you of #
it, by setling what 
ever you please, or all that Estate upon you before I expect any     #
Favour from you.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] You are so Generous beyond my Deserts, that I     #
know not how to Credit 
you.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] Your Modesty is too great, and your Faith too    #
little.

[$ (^Enter Sir^) Tymothy.$]

   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Death, Who are these whith my Mistress and my   #
Sister? Oh! they are the 
silly Fellows that we saw at the Spaw, that came hither last night,  #
do you know Sir, 
that this is my Mistress Sir.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] I know Sir that no man is worthy of that Honour.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Yes Sir, I will make you know that I am Sir,    #
and She has the Honour to be 
my Mistress.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Very well Sir.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Very well Sir, No 'tis very ill Sir, that you   #
should have the boldness to 
take my Mistress by the Hand Sir, and if you do Sir, I must tell you #
Sir -- What do 
you Smile Sir?
<P 33>
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] A man may do what he will with his own Face. I    #
may Smile Sir --
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] If you do Sir, I will fight Sir, I tell you     #
that Sir. hah,
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Sir (^Timothy^) , you are a Bloody-minded man.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] 'Tis for my Honour, my Honour, he is plaguely   #
afraid; look you Sir, if 
you Smile Sir, at me Sir, I will Kick Sir, that's                    #
[^SOURCE TEXT: that s^] more Sir.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] If you do, you will be the fifteenth man I have   #
run through the Body Sir.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Hah! What does he say, through the Body, oh.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] Yonders my Brother, we must not be so             #
perticular, let's [^SOURCE TEXT: let s^] joyn.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] How, the Body Sir.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Yes Sir, and my custom is (if it be a great       #
affront, I kill them, for) I rip out 
their Hearts, dry 'em to Powder, and make Snuff on 'em.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Oh Lord! Snuff!
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] I have a box full in my pocket Sir, will you      #
please to take some.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] No Sir, I thank you Sir: Snuff quoth a, I will  #
have nothing to do with 
such a cruel man, I say no more Sir.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] Your Servant Sir -- 
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Your Servant Sir: does he take such Snuff too?
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] The same -- do you hear Sir, if you value your    #
own life, which I will save 
for the Families sakes, not a word of this to any man.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] No Sir, Not I Sir? Your humble servant.

[$Enter Sir (^Edward^) .$]

   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] I ask your pardon Gentlemen, I was stay'd by    #
what, if you please to 
walk in, will divert you well enough.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] Wee will wait on you Sir.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Daughter, Sir (^Jeffery^) and my (^Lady^) have  #
made complaints of you for
abusing Sir (^Timothy^) ; let me hear no more on't, we have resolv'd #
the Marriage shall 
be to Morrow, it will become you to be upon a little better Tearms   #
to day.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Do you here that Gentlewoman --
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Gentlemen, I have sent to (^Whally^) for all    #
your Servants, and Horses, and 
Doggs, you Must do me the honour to Make some stay with me.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] We cannot enough acknowledg your great Civility.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] No Complements, I obliege my self, Sir          #
(^Jeffery Shacklehead^) and I have 
just now agreed, that to morrow shall be the Day of Marriage between #
our Sons 
and Daughters.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] Very short warning.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Hee'l [^SOURCE TEXT: Hee l^] not delay it longer.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] I'le in and see what the reason of this sudden    #
resolution.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] Sir we wait on you.
   [$Sir (^Edw.^) $] Stay you there a while with Sir (^Timothy^) .   #
[$ (^Ex. all but Sir^) Tim. (^and^) Isab.$]
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Dear Cousin, prethee be kinder to me, I protest #
and vow, as I am a 
Christian, I love the better then both my Eyes, for all this.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Why how now Dogs face, hast thou the Impudence to #
make love again, 
<P 34>
with that hideous Countenance? that very insipid silly (^Physnomy^)  #
of thine? with that 
most piteous mein? why, thou lookst like an (^Operator^) for Teeth.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] This is all sham, I wont beleive it; I can see  #
my self in the great glass, 
and to my mind no man looks more like a Gentleman than my self.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] A Gentleman! with that silly wadling shuffling    #
gate? thou hast not mien good 
enough for a chief Constable, every change of thy Countenance, and   #
every motion 
of thy Body proclaims thee an Ass.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Ay, Ay, come Madam, I shall please you better   #
when I am Marry'd, with 
a trick that I have; I tell yee.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Out of my sight, thou makest me sick to see thee.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] I shall be more Familiar with you to            #
Morrow-night, oh my dear rogue -- 
well I say no more, faith I shall, well, no more to be said.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Be gone thou Basilisk, here, I vow if thou wert   #
the only man on Earth, the 
Kinde should cease rather than I would Marry thee.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] You'l be in a better humour to Morrow-night,    #
though you are such a 
vixen now.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] This place, where some Materials are to mend the  #
Wall, will furnish me with 
some Ammunition: be gone I say.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] I shant do't, I know when I am in good Company, #
come prethee Cousin, 
do not let us Fool any longer, to Morrow we shall be one flesh --    #
de ye see:
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] I had rather be inoculated into a Tree, than be   #
made one Flesh with thee; can 
that (^Westphalia^) hide of thine ever become one Flesh with me?     #
when, I can become one 
Ass with thee it may, you shall never change my mind.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Well, well, I shall have your Body to           #
Morrow-night, and I warrant you
your mind shall soon follow it.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Be gone, thou infinite Coxcomb, I'le              #
[^SOURCE TEXT: I le^] set thee farther. 
[$ (^She throws Stones at him.^) $]
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] What, what, what a pox! hold, what a Devil, are #
you mad? Flesh, 
heart, hold, what a plague, uds bud, I could find in my heart to     #
turn again.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Do filthy Face, do if thou darst.
   [$Sir (^Tim.^) $] Oh help, murder, murder.                        #
[$ (^Ex.^) Sir (^Timothy^) .$]
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] I have no patience with this Fool, no Racks, or   #
Tortures shall force me to 
marry him. [$ (^Ex. Isab.^) $]

[$ (^Enter Young^) Harford (^and^) Theodosia.$]

   [$ (^Theo.^) $] I am very indifferent about this Matrimony, and   #
for ought I see, you are 
so too.
   [$Yo. (^Har.^) $] I must confess you are as fine a Gentlewoman as #
ever I saw, and I am 
not worthy of you; but my Father says he will disinherit me, if I    #
will not marry 
you to Morrow; therefore I desire you would please to think on't.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] I will think on't.
   [$Yo. (^Har.^) $] You shall command all my Estate, and do what    #
you will; for my part, 
I resolve all my Life, to give up my self wholly to my Sports, and   #
my Horses, and 
<P 35>
my Dogs, and to drink now and then a cup of Ale with my Neighbours,  #
I hate 
Wine.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] You will do very well.
   [$Yo. (^Har.^) $] He says we must be Married to Morrow at Ten, I  #
can be going a Hawking 
by six and come home time enough, I would be loath to neglect my     #
Hawking at 
Powts in the height of the Season.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] By no means, you'd do very ill if you should.
   [$Yo. (^Har.^) $] Ay so I should, but shall I tell my Father that #
you will have me to 
Morrow? you know the Writings are Sealed, and Wedding-Cloaths bought #
of all 
sides.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] Well, I shall do as becomes me.
   [$Yo. (^Har.^) $] Well, Cousin there's no more to be said         #
betwixt you and I then, (\Pauca 
Verba\) , a word to the Wise, I say, is enough, so I rest your       #
humble Servant to 
command; I'le tell my Father what you say presently, your Servant    #
to, tell you truly
I had never so much mind to be Married as now; for I have been so    #
woundedly 
frightned with Witches, that I am affraid to lye alone, dee see;     #
well, I am glad this 
business is over: a pox upon all making of Love for me.              #

went a Hawking, brave 
Roysters, honest fellows that did not beleive the Plot.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] Why don't you beleive the Plot?
   [$Yo. (^Har.^) $] No, the Chaplain has told me all; there's no    #
(^Popish^) Plot, but there's a 
(^Presbyterian^) one, he says, none but Phanaticks believe it.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] An Excellent Chaplain to make love to his Patrons #

Why all the Eminent men of our Church beleive it; this fellow is     #
none of the Church,

they'l turn him out of it.

   [$ (^Doubty.^) $] Dear Madam, this is a happy minuite thrown upon #
me unexpectedly, and 
I must use it: To morrow is the fatal day to ruin me.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] It shall not ruin me; the Inquisition should not  #
force me to a Marriage with 
this fool.
   [$ (^Doubty.^) $] This is a step to my Comfort; but when your     #
Father shall to morrow hear 
your refusal, you know not what his passion may produce; restraint   #
of Liberty is 
the least.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] He shall not restrain my Liberty of Choice.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] Put your self into those hands that may defend   #
you from his Power: the 
hands of him, who loves you more than the most Pious value Heaven,   #
than Misers 
Gold, than Clergy men love Power, than Lawyers strife, than Jesuits  #
Blood and 
Treachery.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] If I could find such a man.

one word, and make me 
the happiest man on Earth.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] It comes a little to quick upon me; are you sure  #
you are the man you 
speak of?
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] By Heaven; and by your Self I am, or may I be    #
the scorn of all Mankind; 
and the most Miserable too, without you.
   [$ (^Theo.^) $] Then you shall be the man.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] Heaven; on my Knees I must receive this          #
Blessing; there's not another I 
would ask, my Joy's too big for me.

contract a Friendship with you, intire to all intents and purposes.
   [$ (^Doubt.^) $] 'Tis impossible she should be in earnest, Madam, #
but were she, I cannot 
Marry ever.
