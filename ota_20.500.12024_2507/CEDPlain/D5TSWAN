[$ (^Edward Buckle.^) Sworn.$]

   [$Who deposed, that he liv'd at
(^Walthamstow^) , on (^July^) last, that his House
was about thirty Yards distant from Mr.
(^Jeffreys^) ; that he remembers the Murder
of Mr. (^Jeffreys^) , on the 3d of (^July^) , that
about half an Hour after Two in the
Morning, he heard Miss (^Jeffreys^) make
an Outcry,$] accordingly I got up and
went to the House, and saw Miss
(^Jeffreys^) stand at the Door; I said to her,
what do you stand so in this Manner,
she had something loose about her
Shoulders; I went to the Door, and she
cried, (^They have killed, they have killed
him, I fear^) . She said, (^Go see after my
Uncle, they have killed him, they have killed
him, I fear^) .
   [$ (^Prisoner,^) Miss (^Jeffreys,^) $] I deny it.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Madam, you shall be heard at a
proper Time.
   Where did you see (^John Swan^) ?
   [$ (^Buckle.^) $] (^John Swan^) , met me after he
had unbolted or unlocked the Door, he
was in the Inside, and (^Swan^) said to me,
(^Go up and see after my Master, whom I
fear some cruel Rogues have killed^) . I went
<P 7C1>
up Stairs directly and observed Mr.
(^Jeffreys^) Wounds, they were on the left Side
of his Head [$ (pointing to the Place) $] he
was not dead. I put my right Hand
into his Left, and he squeezing my Hand,
said nothing to me.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] How soon after did you see the
Prisoner Miss (^Jeffreys^) at the Bar?
   [$ (^Buckle.^) $] Very soon after, crying and
lamenting for the Loss of her Uncle. Miss
said to me, will you go and lay an
Information of my Uncle's unhappy Affair.
I said, I would, but 'tis not proper for
me to go alone; she said, take a Man
with you, cost what it will, take a Man
and go and give Information, that by so
doing, the Villains who committed this
unhappy Affair might be found out.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did she mention the Things
lost?
   [$ (^Buckle.^) $] Mrs. (^Martin^) mentioned the
Things that were lost. I can't mention
every Thing in Particular.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you suspect any particular
Persons?
   [$ (^Buckle.^) $] Miss (^Jeffreys^) said, (^If I light
of^) Matthews, (^I will take him up^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] When was this Discourse.
   [$ (^Buckle.^) $] That very Morning of the 3d
of (^July^) .
   [$ (^Prisoner Miss^) Jeffrey's.$] Are you
positive, look to the Jury, take Care what
you say, you are on your Oath.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Can you remember what Goods
were lost.
   [$ (^Buckle.^) $] Some Pewter and some Plate, a
Silver Cup and a Tankard, and fifteen
small Plates.

[$ (^Mary Adams^) , Sworn.$]

   [$She deposed, That she knew Mr.
(^Jeffreys^) very well, that she lived near him,
about 40 Yards; that she heard no Noise
in the Night the Murder was committed,
untill she heard the Report of a Gun or
Pistol, at about Half an Hour after Two
<P 7C2>
in the Morning; that she heard the
Alarm, or Out-cry, about three Quarters
of an Hour after the Pistol or Gun was
discharged; that she went to Mr. (^Jeffreys's^)
House in the Morning, and saw the
Deceased, but being in great Surprize, and
big with Child, she could not stay in the
Room; that she helped on Miss (^Jeffreys^)
Shoes, for Miss said she had hurt her
Ancles by getting out of Window; that
there were a great many Persons there
before her.$]
   [$ (^John Swan, Pris.^) $] This Woman lives
10 Yards farther than the other, who did
not mention to have heard the Noise of
the Pistol.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] So much the worse, that the
Noise was heard so much farther.

[$ (^Thomas Matthews.^) Sworn.$]

   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you know Mr. (^Jeffreys^) ?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] What was the first Occasion of
your knowing him?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] As I was coming over
(^Epping^) Forest, I saw (^John Swan^) and Mr.
(^Jeffreys^) there on the Road, and after he
had enquired where I came from, he took
me into his Service, and sent me home
with (^John Swan^) , and I worked with (^John
Swan^) all that Day; I had no Money for
my Work, having nothing to support me,
I told him I would work for my Bread;
I entered on Service in Mr. (^Jeffreys's^)
House, had no Wages, nor had I agreed
for any.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] How long did you continue with
Mr. (^Jeffreys^) ?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] I worked for him nine
Days, and lived all the Time at his
House.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] What Family had Mr. (^Jeffreys^)
at the Time you lived with him?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] A Maid and (^John Swan^) ,
my Master, and Miss (^Jeffreys^) and a little
Child.
<P 8C1>
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Then Miss (^Jeffreys^) was in the
House?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] What Business did (^John Swan^)
do in the House?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] As a Gardener; and he had
no other Man besides him.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Where did you go after Mr.
(^Jeffreys^) had discharged you?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] I went to work with Mr.
(^Hughes^) , in (^Wood-street^) at (^Walthamstow^) ,
Mr. (^Hughes's^) House is about four or five
hundred Yards from Mr. (^Jeffreys's^) . I
worked with him two Days in his Service,
as a Farmer's Servant, and then I
discharged myself from him.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] While you lived with Mr.
(^Jeffreys^) did not Miss (^Jeffreys^) desire you to
go up Stairs, and wipe down the Chest of
Drawers and a few Chairs?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was it a Chamber?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] It was a Room adjoining to
the House, in the Back-way, a single
Room only, and there was a Pair of Stairs
leading up to that Room. Accordingly I
went up Stairs to wipe down the Chest of
Drawers, and the Chairs.
   [$ (^Cour,.^) $] When you was in the Room did
Miss (^Jeffreys^) come up into the Room?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] Miss (^Jeffreys^) came up to
me and opened the Chest of Drawers,
she came up after me, and I fell to wiping
them; she then said to me, What would
you do to get a hundred Pounds? I said,
I was willing to earn it if in an honest
way: She told me I must go to (^John
Swan^) , and he would tell me. I went to
(^John Swan^) as soon as I came down Stairs,
which was in about a Quarter of an Hour,
he was in the Garden, I told him that Miss
(^Jeffreys^) offered me a hundred Pounds,
and he was the Person that was to resolve
me what I was to do for it; on this (^John^)
smiled, and called me into a private Place
in an Out-house in the Garden, and there
he told me, That if I would take on
<P 8C2>
to knock the old miser his master on the
Head, he would give me 700 (^l.^) Miss
(^Jeffreys^) was in the Yard at the same Time.
I looked and saw her, and she came into
the Out-house while we were there, and
then she entered into other Discourse.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did she hear this Saying about
the 700 (^l.^) ?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] She heard it; she heard
what Discourse passed between us both.
She was close at the Time. She said she
was willing, for she had not a Moment's
Peace while that Miser was alive. She
likewise said to the Gardener, If I would
take on me to knock the old Miser on the
Head, she would see the Money paid.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] After this Discourse passed, do
you remember or recollect (^Jeffreys^) or
(^Swan^) had any Discourse with you about
this Matter?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] (^Swan^) had, but Miss (^Jeffreys^)
had not; he spoke to me several Times
about it, before I went to live at Mr.
(^Hughes's^) . He shew'd me the Pistols he
said he had bought to shoot his Master as
he took a walk out in the Evening. Miss
(^Jeffreys^) was not by at any of these
Discourses. He talked to me in this manner
nine or ten Times, at none of which times
Miss (^Jeffreys^) was present. After I left Mr.
(^Jeffreys's^) Service; I went and worked
two Days at Mr. (^Hughes's^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] While at (^Hughes's^) , did (^Swan^)
say any thing to you about the murder.
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] He never called after me
when at (^Hughes's^) , and never said any
thing to me about the murder while at
(^Hughes's^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Those two Days you were at
(^Hughes's^) , in any of those days did (^Swan^)
not speak any thing to you?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] He spake to me after I had
done work, and asked me how I did;
how I went on, and to drink some Beer;
but no word about the murder; and he
would have me to the (^King's Head^) 
[$ (meaning the (^Duke's Head^) ) $] in (^Woodstreet^) in
<P 9C1>
(^Walthamstow^) , the next Public House to
Mr. (^Jeffreys's^) , and told me, if I wanted
Liquor he would pay for it; but not a
word about the murder.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did he talk any thing about
buying Pistols?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] No, not at that Time, but
after I was discharged from Mr. (^Hughes's^) ,
he said he would give me Half a Guinea
to buy a Pair of Pistols.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] What was you to do with those
Pistols?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] It was to shoot his master
as he came home from (^Chelsea^) along with
one Mr. (^Gallant^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] (^Swan^) had Pistols before, and
you was to buy others?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] But I bought none. I went
to (^Low-Layton^) , at the (^Green-man^) , there I
spent the money; and the day after I had
spent the money, (^Swan^) overtook me on
the road, and we went together to the
(^Green-man^) and (^Bell^) , in (^White-chapel^) , one
Mr. (^Gall^) . I cannot tell what day of the
month it was, but it was about Six in the
Afternoon when we came to (^Gall's^)
house.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] When you came to (^Gall's^) house,
had you any Liquor?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] (^Swan^) overtook me on the 
road, and was almost drunk, and said unto
me, Where are you going to? I told him,
to (^London^) ; and he gave me Three-pence
to buy a Quart of Beer, and called for
half a pint of Wine at the (^Green-man^) , at
(^Low-Layton^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was there any thing passed
between (^Swan^) and you, before you came
to (^Gall's^) house?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] No; we came to (^Gall's^)
house about Six in the Afternoon, and
there we had Beer, and staid till eleven o'
Clock at Night; and (^Swan^) got up and
challenged the best man in the house to
fight him for a Guinea; and I being in
liquor, we both stript, and (^Swan's^) Coat
was thrown on the fire, whereby the
<P 9C2>
lineing was burnt, which being observed, the
Coat was taken up and the Pockets found
to be heavy, on which they were search'd,
and there they found the Pistols: I saw
the Pistols, and Mr. (^Gall^) took them, and
I saw them in Mr. (^Gall's^) Hands, but did
not see him take them out of his
Coat-Pockets; and there being a Watchman in
the House, Mr. (^Gall^) ordered him to call
some more Watchmen, and they came in
and carried us both to the Cage. (^Swan^)
pulled out of his pocket three Rings,
which he said he was going to pawn, in
order to get some money for Miss (^Jeffreys^) .
We were detained in the Cage all the
Night, and the next morning we were
carried before Sir (^Samuel Gower^) , who after
Examination committed us both to
(^Clerkenwell, Bridewell^) , where we continued for
twenty-four Hours, until Miss (^Jeffreys^)
came and released us. She came to the
Justice, and we were carried again before
Sir (^Samuel Gower^) , and then Miss (^Jeffreys^)
was there. I cannot say what passed
between Miss (^Jeffreys^) and the Justice, but
the Justice ordered us both to be discharged,
and after we were discharged, we went
back together to (^Gall's^) House again.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was any Thing said about the
Rings?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] No, (^Swan^) parted from me
then, and gave me a Shilling, and order'd
me to meet him at the (^Yorkshire Gray^) , 
between (^White Chappel^) and (^Stratford, John
Swan^) , and Miss (^Jeffreys's^) , and one (^Thomas
Smith^) , went in a Coach, and I walked to
the (^Yorkshire Gray^) after them, and there I
found them all three.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] When you found then there,
can you recollect what passed.
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] I could not hear what passed,
for they were in the Parlour, and (^John
Swan^) came out, and gave me half a
Crown, and appointed me to meet him
the next Day at the same House.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you do so?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] I did, but (^Swan^) did not
<P 10C1>
come untill Seven in the Evening; Miss
(^Jeffreys^) was not there that Day.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] What followed.
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] (^Smith^) was to go to make up
Matters at Home, that (^Swan^) might come
home again to his Master. (^Tom Smith^)
said, he did not know the Way, and
(^Swan^) said, I was to shew him. I did
not hear the Words that passed between
(^Swan^) and (^Smith^) ; but I shew'd (^Tom Smith^)
the Way, and afterwards (^Smith^) and I
went back again, (^Smith^) told me, Miss
had made up Matters with her Uncle, and
when we came back to (^Swan^) , which was
the very same Afternoon, and he told me,
to meet him again upon (^Epping Forrest^) ,
(^Sunday^) at Two o'Clock in the Afternoon.
I saw him on the (^Sunday^) , and we had
Talk together, and I was to come at Six
o'Clock to the (^Buck^) that very Day, on
the (^Sunday^) . (^Swan^) came to the (^Buck^) , and
we was at the (^Buck^) together, but not a
Word passed of the Murder there; we
stayed about an Hour together, and then
(^Swan^) went Home, and I went to (^Low
Layton^) ; I saw him about Two o'Clock
on (^Monday^) afterwards, when we
continued together about two or three Hours.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was any Thing said of a Time,
or a proper Time.
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] I can't remember, but from
thence I went to (^Epping^) , and stayed there
four Days, which is about twelve Miles
distant, and then I came back to
(^Walthamstow^) , which was on the (^Saturday^) ;
and the first Time I saw (^Swan^) again, was
on the (^Monday^) following, and that was at
the (^Buck^) , about Six in the Morning, and
then he told me, to meet him the next
Day at a Public House by (^Walthamstow^)
Church; about Three o'Clock in the
Afternoon; accordingly I went there the
next Day (^Tuesday^) , at the Time
appointed, and was there before (^Swan^) came,
and when he came Miss (^Jeffreys's^) came
there also, and no Body else, there we
talked all three together.
<P 10C2>
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Tell what passed.
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] They order'd me, that I
must come the (^Tuesday^) following to the
Back of Mr. (^Jeffreys^) Garden, at Ten
o'Clock at Night, and (^John Swan^) was to
meet me there, and said, he would give
me some Money, and that he would leave
the Garden-door open; when I came to
the Garden, the Door was not open, nor
did I see (^Swan^) , but waited two Hours
before I saw (^Swan^) , who came to me about
Twelve o'Clock; I did not stay long in
the Garden. (^John Swan^) told me, he
would give me some Money to knock the
old Miser his Master on the Head, there
was no Person then there besides. I was
to go into the Pantry, and I got into the
Pantry, and (^John Swan^) brought me some
Victuals, and I stayed behind a Tub until
(^John Swan^) and Miss (^Jeffreys^) came; (^Swan^)
came to me first, and then Miss; I saw
them, and Miss Jeffreys said, now is the
Time to knock your Master on the Head;
and I said, I can't find in my Heart to do
it; Miss (^Jeffreys^) said, Damn you, you
Villain do it.
   [$ (^Prisoner, Miss^) Jeffreys.$] (^Matthews^) ,
look to the Jury, consider what you
say.
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] (^Swan^) then clapped his Hand
into his Pocket, and drew out a Book to
put me to my Oath, and I put my Hand
on the Book, and took my Oath never
to blow it, and then (^Swan^) said, the
Pistols were loaded, one with Slugs, the
other with Ball.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] What was they both to do.
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] To shoot Misses Uncle,
and (^Swan^) said, G--d D--n your Blood,
I have a great Mind to shoot you, and to
blow your Brains out, because you will
not perform according to your Promise,
and I told him, I could not find in my
Heart to do it. They parted directly
from me, and went both up Stairs, and
left me below still in the Pantry, and in
about half an Hour after, they were gone
<P 11C1>
from me, I heard a Pistol go off, I
heard no more, nor saw no Body
afterwards: I went away directly, through
(^Walthamstow^) , and made away for the
Ferry for (^Endfield Chace^) and for (^London^) ,
and went down into (^Kent^) , and staid all
the Harvesting.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Can you recollect yourself, did
you make them any Promise for such an
Undertaking?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] I made them the Promise
when going to (^London^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] When was the last Time of
making the Promise; was there any
Thing of that Kind passed at the (^Buck^) ,
or the Alehouse by (^Walthamstow^) Church.
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] Yes, at the (^Buck^) ; but at
the Alehouse near (^Walthamstow^) Church,
I can't say there was; (^John Swan^) spoke
to me, and said, Damn you, what do
you get drunk for; and I said, it was
with none of your Money. I was drunk
at the same Time.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did (^John Swan^) never say any
Words to you, if you did not do it he
must do it himself?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] He told me, that if I would
not do it, by God he must, for Miss
(^Jeffreys^) is big with Child by him, and if the
old miser should know it, they should be
both banished the House.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] When they found that you
refused this Matter, did they say what was
to be done?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] They did not tell me any
Word about it, they did not say who
should do it.
   After my Return back from (^Kent^) to
(^London^) , I endeavoured to go to the
(^East-Indies^) , I went to the (^India^) House, and
intended to go, but was not shipp'd. (^Gall^)
came to me at a House where I was, and
I told him my Name was (^Smith^) . I did not
know Mr. (^Gall^) at first. He said to me,
You are the man I want to speak with,
you must go along with me. And I went
along with him; and by the way (^Gall^)
<P 11C2>
said to me, Is not your Name (^Thomas
Matthews^) ? And I said yes.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] What Discourse passed at the
Alehouse near (^Walthamstow^) Church, and
how long was this meeting before Mr.
(^Jeffreys^) was killed?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] About a Week before, when
(^Swan^) and Jeffreys met me both by
Appointment, and (^Swan^) said, It was a Thing
must be done.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] You say (^John Swan^) brought you
Victuals, pray what Victuals was it?
   [$ (^Matthews.^) $] Beef, boiled.

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 12C2>
[$ (^Sarah Arnold.^) Sworn.$]

   [$She deposed, That she was servant to
Mr. (^Jeffreys^) , lived there about four Years,
that (^John Swan^) lived there at the same
Time, perhaps about two Years; that the
Capacity he was in there, was to do every
Thing his Master set him about; and she
believes (^John Swan^) was in the House when
the murder was committed.$]
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Who was with your master the
Day before the murder was committed?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Dr. (^Clifton^) and his Wife, Mrs.
(^Martin^) and her two Children; who dined
there the Day before the murder was
committed.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did they continue there all the
Afternoon?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] They went out in the
Afternoon to drink Tea at the (^Royal Oak^) , and
came back at Eleven o'Clock at Night,
with all the Company.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] When they went out, did they
give you any Orders about [^SOURCE TEXT: abaut^] taking care of
the Doors.
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes, and I went to fasten the
outer Door before they came home, and
the Door in the Garden; I barr'd them
and fasten'd all the outer Doors of the
Garden to the Field, and all the Gates
I fasten'd that were in the Garden.
And the Company returned about supper
Time. Dr. (^Clifton^) and Mrs. (^Clifton^) went
home. Only Mrs. (^Martin^) and the
Children stayed supper. (^John Swan^) waited on
them. I put the Child to Bed. Of
the provision in the House, boiled Beef,
was one Dish.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Do you remember Miss (^Jeffreys^)
being out of the House with (^John Swan^) ?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] They went out for a Quarter
of an Hour, out of the Garden Door
facing the Kitchen; and this was between
Eleven and Twelve. Mrs. (^Martin^) was
there at that Time. I saw them come in
again. They came in separate; (^John
Swan^) came in first, and went to Bed
<P 13C1>
directly. This was about a Quarter of an
Hour after they went out. It was usual
for him, if he went to Bed before his
master, to ask his Leave, but that Night he
went without his usual Leave.
Afterwards Miss (^Jeffreys^) came in, in a very
little Time.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was she particularly pressing
to her uncle to go to bed, or the Company
to go away?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes; more than usual; and
the Reason she gave was, that he was in
liquor and might be disorder'd in the
morning: He was not quite drunk, but pretty
much in liquor, very far on.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did she press him in any manner
as to be very particular?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] I did not take any notice of it
then, but reflected on it afterwards.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did she press Mrs. (^Martin^) to go
away?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes; and she went away about
Twelve; and about half an Hour after,
my master, Miss, and I, went up stairs all
together; and before I went up stairs, I
fastened all the doors and windows, the
back door as well as the rest, and I heard
no more until the Alarm was given in the
morning. I did not lie on the same floor
with my master, but in the upper part of
the House. Mr. (^Jeffreys^) and Miss lay on
the same floor, there was but a very thin
partition between them; (^John Swan^) lay
on the same floor farther off. There was
a door on my Staircase which I likewise
locked. I heard nothing of the pistol's
going off. (^John^) called me to come
down, for he was afraid there were
thieves in the house; it was day-light
when he called me; it was on the 3d of
(^July^) . As soon as I came down I
enquired where my master was. (^John Swan^)
said, he believed he was dead or murdered.
I ran directly into my master's room, and
found him lying on his back, his legs
drawn up, rattling in his throat. I put
my hand on his wounds, and found the
<P 13C2>
blood quite congealed; I saw a knife in
the room by the bed-side; it was my
master's knife; it was called his working
knife; it lay the day before upon the
bench at the Garden-door, going out of 
the Kitchen; she particularly knew it
lay there then, because she had then given
meat to the Cats, and used that knife to
cut it out for them. The knife was not
bloody, I could not perceive any Sign of
blood upon it. Some time of the day I
saw the pistol, the pieces of the pistol
were pulled out from the bed under my
master, it looked like a pistol that had
been burst, and there were some pieces of
the iron-work; the pieces of the pistol
lay together, and being joined looked
like the pieces of a pistol that had been
burst.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you observe the Bell-rope?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes, my Lord; it looked as if
it was either cut or broke off; which, I
don't know.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you see any Wound in his
hand?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes; some part of his 
Left-hand was wounded; it looked as if done
with a Knife. After I came out of my
master's Room, I went to the door of
Miss's Room, and tried to open it, and
found her door locked.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was it usual for her to have her
door locked?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes, my Lord, it was usual for
it to be locked. I then went up stairs
into my own Room, and looked out of
my window, and called out aloud that
my master's Throat was cut from Ear to
Ear, and I saw Miss (^Jeffreys^) in the Yard
with something loose over her Shoulders.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did she get out of the
Window?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] I don't know that.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was there any of the
Neighbours got about the house?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes, a great many stood round,
none were got into the house at that
<P 14C1>
time. When I came down, I found the
back door open that goes into the Yard,
but I did not observe that the house was
broke open. It was usual for my master's
pistols to hang in the Kitchen over the
Fire-place.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did your master keep any
Powder or Ball in the house?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes, my Lord, in a drawer in
the Kitchen.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you observe, after this, that
those Pistols were in their Places?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] After I came down, some
time in the morning, I saw one of the
Pistols was gone; (^John Swan^) observed
it and said, (^one of my master's Pistols is
gone^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you observe the Powder and
Ball was gone?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] No, my Lord, I did not
observe that, for the Drawer used to be
lock'd.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was the Key in the usual place?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] I did not observe the Key of
Powder and Ball was remov'd. I
observ'd some Chips of the Bullets lay about
the Kitchen floor.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you observe any 
Differences between your master and Miss
(^Jeffreys^) ?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] My master did not like she
should be seen so much conversing with
(^John Swan^) , because People took notice
of it; and he used to be angry with her
sometimes, because she would not come
into such methods as he would have her,
and was displeased with her manner of
Life, and threatened he would turn her
out of doors. I heard him tell Mrs.
(^Martin^) , that he would alter his Will, and
Miss (^Jeffreys^) was in the Hall when he
said it, and he said he would settle it on
(^Joe Martin^) . I have before often heard
my master say, all I have in the world is
her's. When my master threatened her,
she seemed to be very uneasy, but I did
not hear her make any Answer to her
Uncle.
<P 14C2>
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you know where your
master's Will used to be kept?
   [$ (^Arnold.^) $] Yes, my Lord; in a little box,
on an iron Chest, by his bed-side, and that
box was gone that morning.

[$ (^Anthony Gallant, sworn.^) $]

   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you know Mr. (^Jeffreys^) ?
   [$ (^Gallant.^) $] Yes, my Lord; I was well
acquainted with him; he was a good
Friend of mine.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was there any Application
made to you by Miss (^Jeffreys^) , to take
her Uncle out.
   [$ (^Gallant.^) $] The Week before Mr.
(^Jeffreys^) was murder'd, (^John Swan^) came to
my Shop, and told me, Miss (^Jeffreys^)
wanted to speak with me, and that I must
go to the Garden-gate, and she would
come to me; accordingly I went, and in
a little Time she came to me, it was on
a (^Tuesday^) the 25th of (^June^) , and desired
me to make a Tate for a Lady of her
Acquaintance, and after she waved that
Discourse, and desired me to take her
Uncle some Day out with me to
(^Buckets-Hill^) , (which is about four Miles distant)
and keep him out until it was pretty late
at Night, and make him pretty much in
Liquor, and if I spent Half a Crown or
Crown, she would give me the money, and
something for myself. I answered her,
My Business would not permit me at
that Time; to which she replied, Dear
(^Gallant^) , do if possible, do it this Week,
if it can't be done this Week, it must be
done next; I shall soon have Money, and
if you want two or three Guineas, I will
lend it you, and not hurry you for the
Payment of it. She told me, she
wanted to be out all Night, and when her
Uncle was in Liquor, he did not use to
enquire after her. I asked her, how we
must order it with (^Sarah^) [$ (meaning the
Maid Servant) $] she said, she would bring
<P 15C1>
her over. The (^Tuesday^) following, the
Accident happened, my Man was at her
House, and she sent Word by him, that
she wanted to speak with me; I went
over, and she bid me ask her Uncle to go
out that Day, which was the Day before
his Death [^SOURCE TEXT: Deatb^] ; I did ask him, but he gave
me no positive Answer, and so we did
not go out, it was about Noon when I
was there; I had been out several Times
with Mr. (^Jeffreys^) , particularly the 24th
of (^June^) , we went to (^Chelsea^) , and came
home at Two o'Clock in the Morning.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Had you any Conversation with
(^John Swan^) after the Murder was
committed.
   [$ (^Gallant.^) $] I asked (^John^) where that Villain
(^Matthew^) was, for my Heart gives me, he
was concerned in it, and (^Swan^) answered,
he was as innocent as a Lamb, and
Miss (^Jeffreys^) throw'd herself into a
Chair, and cried out, (^Oh! I shall die a
worser Death than my Uncle did^) .
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you observe any improper
Behaviour between (^Swan^) and Miss
(^Jeffreys^) .
   [$ (^Gallant.^) $] Upon my Word, I never did.

[$Ann Wright, (^sworn^) .$]
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Mrs. (^Wright^) , you keep the
(^Yorkshire-Gray^) at (^Stratford^) : Do you
remember Miss (^Jeffreys^) and any other
Person coming to your house about (^June^)
last?
   [$ (^Wright.^) $] I can't remember the month
nor day; but Miss (^Jeffreys^) and (^John
Swan^) came to my house in a Coach, and
staid two or three hours. Miss (^Jeffreys^)
said she had been fetching (^John Swan^) out
of Confinement. After this, she cried,
and said she believ'd she was damned.
The morning the murder was committed,
(^John Swan^) came to my house, and said,
a bad Accident had happened, his master
was murdered, and desired I would get
him a Horse or a Coach, and he went to
Town. He said his master was shot with
his own Gun, and robbed of a few trifles,
a Cup, and the like. And when he came
back, he said, his master was shot with
his own Pistol that used to hang up in his
own Kitchen.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] How came he to say that?
   [$ (^Wright.^) $] Please you, my Lord, I don't
know.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was he in liquor, or not?
   [$ (^Wright.^) $] He seemed very sleepy, and in
my opinion, he had been a drinking.
[$ (^John Mills^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^Mills.^) $] (^John Swan^) came to my House
the Morning the Murder was committed;
and said he was going to (^Chelsea^) to a
Gentleman's Clerk, and call'd for a Gill of
<P 20C2>
Rum and asked me, if I had heard of the
murder of a Gentleman of (^Walthamstow^) ;
I told him I had heard a Gentleman was
shot in his bed by housebreakers. A Man
standing by told him, he heard that miss
jump'd out of the Window. (^Swan^) made
answer, it was his neice. When he came
back, the coach stopped to water their
horses at my Door, and I saw him; he
seem'd much in liquor, but did not see him
stir or speak, all the time in the coach,
[$ (^Samuel Adams^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you hear any thing of the
alarm at mr. [^SOURCE TEXT: my^] (^Jeffreys's^) house the night he
was murdered?
   [$ (^Adams.^) $] Yes, my lord, and I went there
and heard miss (^Jeffreys^) cry out, fire and
murder, and I went into the court, and
miss (^Jeffreys^) was at the chamber window,
crying, there was rogues and thieves in the
house, and they had set the house on fire.
I saw (^John Swan^) open the door in his
shirt: this was about three o'clock in the
morning. And miss (^Jeffreys^) desir'd him
to get a ladder, for there were rogues in
the house. And I having nothing to
defend my self, went to get a bill as well as
a ladder. My house is about thirty yards
from mr. (^Jeffreys^) , and her window was
the same side as the door, next to that over
the door. (^John Dyer^) and (^Richard Clark^)
were there also  The maid was in the
Court-yard.
[$ (^Jeffery Mead^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^Mead.^) $] I came into the street about
seven in the morning, and was met by
several neighbours; I proceeded on, and
went into the house, and looked about to
see whether I could find any marks of the
doors or windows being broke open, where
persons might enter the house, and saw a
bar of a window at the back-door bent,
and the lead as regularly untwisted in the
inside, as if done by a glazier. I
apprehend it was done by some of the family.
   I desir'd (^John Swan^) to give me some
rakes, and shew me the ponds about the
<P 21C1>
Place that we might make a search, and he
got two rakes, and sent for three men to
search, and in searching they found a new
sack with some pewter and brass in it.
When miss (^Jeffreys^) was apprehended, she
said, I hope you won't use me ill, for I
gave mr, (^Smart^) a 500 l. bank note that
day. And, said she, to let all the world
know that mr. (^Jeffreys^) did not lose his life
to wrong mr. (^Martin's^) children, she put
her hand into her bosom, and pull'd out
a 100 l. bank-note, and said, here mrs.
(^Martin^) , I give you this for you and your
children, and made her a present thereof:
this was as she was getting into the coach.
[$Mr. (^Gallant^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Mr. (^Gallant^) do you remember
the time mr. (^Jeffreys^) was murder'd?
   [$ (^Gallant.^) $] Yes, my lord, as soon as I
could dress my self I went to the house
and a great many persons were there.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Did you remember miss's taking
any particular care about the box of
writings in mr. (^Jeffreys's^) room?
   [$ (^Gallant.^) $] Yes, about an hour and a half
after I came, she called to mrs. (^Buckle^) ,
and told her to go into mr. (^Jeffreys's^) room;
take the box of writings; carry them into
her room, and lock up the room, and
give her the key.
   [$ (^Sarah Arnold^) being called again, was
asked, where her master's will was kept,
she answer'd, in a little box on the iron
chest, in her master's room, by his
bed-side; that the box was there when she
first went into the room, and that she was
sure the will was kept in that box.$]
[$ (^Richard Clarke^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Was you at mr. (^Jeffreys's^) house
the morning he was murder'd?
   [$ (^Clarke.^) $] Yes, my lord, and heard the
outcry, murder, fire, thieves. I live
about fifty yards from mr. (^Jeffreys's^) house;
I saw miss at the window over the door,
and (^Swan^) in the court. Miss said, make
all the haste possible you can, for there
are thieves in the house, and I am afraid
<P 21C2>
my uncle is murdered: this was about two
or three in the morning; and (^Swan^) was
in his shirt. (^Swan^) said to me, he believ'd
they got in at the window, and out at the
door backwards, for they were both open.
   I examin'd the windows and door, and
found nothing broke, nor any strain; nor
no track of feet in the garden, tho' 'twas
a wet dewy morning.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Do you know the pond where
the sack was found?
   [$ (^Clark.^) $] There is a fence at both sides of
the pond.
   [$ (^Court.^) $] Had you any conversation with
(^Swan^) , and what was it.?
   [$ (^Clark.^) $] About a quarter of a Year
before the murder happened, he called on
me to take a walk, and fetch a horse out
of the marsh; coming back by my lord
(^Castlemain's^) , he asked me, if I was a hearty
man, sufficient to shoot any thing: I told
him, I was no sportsman, and could not
shoot well: he said, if I was, he could
help me to 50 l. and a horse to ride on.
[$ (^John Gall^) Sworn.$]
   [$ (^Gall.^) $] Hearing a bad accident had
happened to mr. (^Jeffreys^) , I asked how is it
the gentleman is shot: mr. (^Tipping^) the
apothecary and I went into the house, and
was in the room close to mr. (^Jeffreys^) , and
I said, my dear sir I am sorry to see this;
if you think you know who did the
murder hold up your hand; with that he
held up his left hand; he was dabbing his
wounds with his handkerchief, but as
soon as this was mentioned of holding up
his hand, he dropt his handkerchief and
held up his hand.
[$ (^The Prisoner's Defence.^) $]
   [$ (^Court.^) $] You have heard what has been
charged against you, now is your Time
to make your Defence. (^John Swan^) ,
have you any Witness to call?
   [$ (^Swan,^) Prisoner.$] Yes.
   [$ (^Elizabeth Jeffreys,^) Prisoner.$] I
conclude most of them are perjured. I will
leave my Cause to be pleaded by the
Counsel.
<P 22C1>
[$ (^Elizabeth Diaper^) sworn.$]
   [$ (^Diaper.^) $] I lived a few Yards from
Mr. (^Jeffreys^) , and do remember when he
was murdered. Between two and three
o'Clock in the Morning I heard a Voice
calling out (^Diaper, Diaper^) ; on which I
then jumped out of Bed, opened the
Window, and saw Miss (^Jeffreys^) calling
out, there are Rogues in the House. I
was undressed, and in my Shift: I took
my Gown, and said, I am coming as
fast as I can. They were still crying out,
Fire and Thieves. The Maid was at the
Window at the same Time.
   [$ (^This Witness fainted in the Court, and
so was obliged to be carried out, and
