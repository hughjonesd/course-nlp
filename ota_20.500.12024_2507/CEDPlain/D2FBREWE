[}HOW MAISTER PETER DECEIUED THE DIUELL WITH A 
CANDLES END.}]
[^MASTER PETER HAD RAISED A SPIRIT BY MAGIC, AND THE SPIRIT HAD 
AGREED TO SERVE HIM FOR A TIME, IN EXCHANGE FOR HIS SOUL. WHEN THE
SPIRIT DECIDED IT HAD SERVED HIM ENOUGH, IT DEMANDED PAYMENT.^]
<P A4V>
[^...^] UUhy [$ (sayde Master (^PETER^) $] I haue
made thee a promise, thou shouldst haue it, and thou shalt
haue it, but not yet: when it hath left my body (by my 
death) take it to thee, till then thou mayest not haue it,
so rest thee contented. [$Then the spirit beganne to
threaten, and terrifie him to make him set a time of payment
for his pleasure: and so affrighted him, that hee knew not
what or how to answere him.$] Come [$ (quoth the Deuill) $]
be breefe, for Lucifer euery minute, lookes for that soule of
thine. Is there no remedy [$ (quoth Maister (^Peter^) ) $] wilt
thou allow mee no time, to set my businesse in order, and
take my leaue of my friends ere I goe? allow mee some
small time for that, and doe thy will. Why how long time
[$ (quoth the Deuill?$] desirest thou I should allow thee? why
ifaith [$ (quoth master (^Peter^) $] no long time: spare me but till
this inche-long end of candle [$ (pointing to the Candle
burning in his study) $] and take my soule. UUell [$ (quoth the 
Deuill) $] though by my charge I can hardly stay a minute,
Ile stay so long: about it presently. If I neglect or ore-slip
my time [$ (qd. M. (^Peter^) ) $] take thou the aduantage of it: yet
one request more thou must grant me. What is that [$ (qd. the
deuil) $] Marry this [$ (qd. M. (^Peter^) ) $] to confirme thy promise
with an oath: I am very loath to trust thee on thy bare word
for all the world reputes thee but a knaue: therefore come
sweare to forbeare mee till this candle is burned. By Hell
I will [$ (qd. the Deuill) $] and by great (^Lucifer^) , As I hope to
draw downe thousand soules to the deepe (^Abisse^) (the place
of my abode) I will forbeare thee till that candle is burned.
<P B1R>
[$Then (^Maister Peter^) , presently after his hellish 
protestation, put the candle out, and into his pocket:$] looke heere
[$ (quoth hee) $] till this is burnt, thou maiest not claime my
soule: Ile keepe this safe enough from burning out and so
keepe that thou lookst for safe enough. Go I command thee,
and tell thy proud Lord (^Lucifer^) , how finely I haue 
ouerreached thee.
   [$When the Deuill saw he was so cunningly deceiued by
(^Maister PETER^) , with many bitter execrations he left
him.$]

[} (^HOW MAISTER PETER DECEIUED THE DEUILL AGAINE.^) }]
   [$Not long after the (^Deuill^) had bin thus deceiued by the
merry (^Deuill^) , (^Maister Peter Fabell^) , hee went 
againe to him, and finding him a sleepe, tooke the end of
the candle (before spoken of) out of his pocket, and awaked
him: when he had so done, he shewed him the end of the
candle.$]
   Looke heere [$ (sayd hee) $] heere is that thou keptst to keepe
me from my right (thy soule I meane) when this is burnt,
thy soule must burne with mine: Ile quickely burne it
now (Ile warrant thee.)
   [$When (^Maister Peter^) saw he had lost his candle, (vpon
the losse of which lay the losse of his soule, if his policie had
not once more helped him out) he intreated him to spare
him a little longer.$]
   No, no [$ (sayd the (^Deuill^) ,$] all intreates are vaine, thou
hast deceiued me once, thou shalt deceiue me no more.
Tis a good world, when men are so cunning in deceit. as 
to deceiue the (^Deuill^) : but it is no matter, thou art so much
the redier for me.
   Yet heere me speake [$ (quoth (^Maister Peter^) $] and as thou
likest my speech so deale with me.
   Well be breefe then [$ (quoth the Deuill) $] what hast thou
now to say?
   No more but this [$ (qd. (^Maister Peter^) $] if thou wilt spare
<P B1V>
till my timely death, put that thou seekest into thy hands,
Ile labor all the time I haue to liue for Hells aduantage:
Ile beare more soules along with me to Hell then twenty
of your cunningst Deuills shall.
   Shall I once more trust thee [$ (quoth the Diuell) $] on thy
word? well, sweare, Why [$ (sayd (^Maister Peter^) $] by the
blacke riuer, (^Lucifer^) thy Lord sweares by, I sweare I
will: and when I am buried, either within the Church, 
without the Church, in the Church porch, Church-yard
Street, field, or high way, take thou my soule.
   Well [$ (quoth the Deuill) $] in hope thou wilt gaine me
many soules to thine, take thy rest, [$and so he left him.$] 
   [$Many yeares after when (^Maister Peter Fabell^) by his
white haires, weakenesse, aches, and such like signes 
perceiued he could not liue long: he went and digd his 
deathbed in the Church wal, and there rested day & night hartyly
praying & repenting him of all the euill he had committed.$]
   [$When the hower was well nigh come, that should
seperate his soule and body, the Deuill went to him againe
and blam'd him for neglecting his businesse by promise, and
withal tould him he was come for his soule. When (^Maister
Peter^) heard that word, hee presently started vp and
charged him to depart,$] my soule [$ (sayd he) $] thou comest too    #
soone,
and yet to late to haue it: he that redeemed my soule hath 
took't to keepe, thou canst not haue it.
   Didst thou not sweare [$ (qd. the fiend) $] that I should haue
thy soule at y=e= houre of death? thou didst, and I will haue it.
I [$ (sayd (^Maister Peter^) $] when I am buried either within the
Church, without the Church, in the Church-porch 
Church-yard, street, field, or high way, take thou my soule.
   See foolish fiend thou art deceiued againe, this hole is
my graue, If this be either within the Church, without the 
Church, in the Church porch Church yard, street, field, or
high-way, my soule is thine: thou seest it is not, therefore
I charge thee (so deceiued) depart. [$Still the Deuill was
very eager on him for his soule, till at last, by his earnest
<P B2R>
praires & zealous Inuocations he forst him to run roaring
to hel againe without it.$]
[} (^HOW MAISTER PETER FABELL, PUNISHED A FRYER AND HIS
LEMON FOR THEIR KNAUERY.^) }]
   [$ (^Maister Peter Fabell^) one morning very early, walking
the fields (as his custome was, to meditate by
himselfe) spied a Fryer at prayers vpon his beads, very 
deuotly, when (^Maister Peter^) saw him so earnest in his praiers he
went to him, & demanded of him what his reason was, that
his chamber would not serue, for his prayers as well as
that place.$] Oh! sir [$ (said the Fryer) $] all places are alike to
me for this businesse, & all times, for I pray when the pricke
of conscience commes vpon me, in what place, or at what
time soeuer. I commend thee much [$ (quoth (^Maister Peter^) ) $]
thou art an honest fellow, and so for that time they parted.
[^WHEN MASTER PETER CAME UPON THE SAME FRIER IN THE SAME PLACE THE
FOLLOWING MORNING, HE WAS KISSING A WENCH. MASTER PETER, WHO HAD 
STOOD WATCHING THEM FROM BEHIND A HOLLOW TREE FOR SOME TIME, DECIDED
TO GIVE THEM A FRIGHT. HE CLIMBED IN TO THE TREE AND BEGAN TO CALL 
IN THIS MANNER.^]
[^---^] Frier, Frier,
Frier, [$the Frier hearing a voice, presently started vp, and
looked round a bout him to see if he could finde the (^Maister^)
of that tongue y=t= called him: but in vaine he stood looking for
he stood farre enough from his eye, though he were close to
his eare. When the Fryer had stood a good while looking
about him, first on y=e= one side, then on the other, and could
spy no body, like a kind letcherous bald-pate, very
handsomely, or rather very knauishly, he went to his wench
againe. Hee was no sooner layed downe, but (^Maister Peter^) y=e=
second time, cried out (to disturb him) $] Fryer, fryer, Fryer.
<P B2V>
[$At this second call the Fryer halfe affrighted, started vp
againe, and lookt about him (a tip toe) to see if he could
finde a body to that voice: but hee found none.$]
   Now our Lady defend vs [$ (quoth the Frier to his wench) $]
what voice is this that calls on me so oft? Didst not thou
heare it? yes faith sweeting [$ (quoth she) $] I heard some body
call to thee: canst thou not see him?
   No faith chucke [$ (quoth the Fryer) $] I can see no man: and
yet surely this voice, is the voice of a man. But it is no
matter, let it be what it will, if we cannot see it sure we
cannot feele it. Come chucke let's busse and be merry, be of
good comfort and crosse thy selfe, and I warrant thee safe
for a farthing, downe lay ould bald-pate againe: [$but before
he could giue her three kisses, the voice raised him the third
time, crying as before,$] Fryer, Fryer, Fryer. [$Then
the Fryers face beganne to bewray his feare: he had no
more colour in his face, at that time, (though at all other
times he had coloure enough) then one of these fine whay
fac'd oate-meale eaters, or a wench troubled with the
greene sickenesse.$]
   Fryer, frier, frier, [$ (said (^Maister Peter^) ) (still keeping
himselfe close in the hollow tree) $] hee that sees thee now, vnseene
of thee, sees at all times, in all places, and all these thy
actions.
   Heere yesterday I saw thee at thy prayers verie 
deuotly, with thy booke and beades is this the booke thou
bringest to pray on now? doth the pricke of conscience mooue
thee to doe this? speake thou blacke sinner. There thou
hast red thy damnation without present repentance, and
pennance. Therefore presently, both of you, if you
respect more the good of your soules, then of your bodyes, by
the pennance I shall appoynt you, purge your selues: [$when
the Fryer and his wench heard these wordes, they were
verilie perswaded in their mindes that it was the voice of
an Angell they both kneeled downe, very reuerently 
together, and sayd,$] thy will be done: appoynt our pennance,
<P B3R>
and we are ready (with all willingnes) to indure it.
Then [$ (sayde (^Maister Peter^) $] you both shall presently be
whipt, from this place (the place where you offended) 
into the Town and about the town. This suffer & desire you
to be done by the next man comes neere you, and this sin is
forgiuen you, refuse this, & despairing die damd wretches.
   This or what else it shall please thee to inflict or lay
vppon vs, for this sinne [$ (quoth the Fryer) $] we will patiently
suffer.
   [$Then (^Maister Peter^) presently stept out of the hollow tree,
and went (very cunningly) round about on the backeside
of a hedge, and came directly vpon them, as if he had ment
to passe by them.$]
   [$As soone as euer they saw him, they very humbly on
their knees tould him, that in that place they had offended,
and for that offence, they were by the voice of an Angell,
commanded to take present pennance, or their soules could
not be saued.$]
   And what [$ (saide (^Maister Peter^) ) $] is the pennance
commaunded?
   Marry this sir [$ (said the Fryer) $] to be whipt by the next
man came neare vs, from this place (the place where we
offended) to the towne, and about the towne, and this sin
should be forgiuen vs. If we refuse this (this was our
heauie sentence) to liue in despaire, and die damd wretches.
   This therefore is our request sir (you being the man by
the Angell appointed) that you would performe your part
appointed, while we (very patiently) beare the reward
of our wickednesse.
   Well [$ (quoth (^Maister Peter^) ) $] though I am loath to play
the beadle, Ile doe thy request, you shall not be damd for
want of a whipping.
[^MASTER PETER TIED THEIR HANDS TOGETHER, TOOK A ROD OF WILLOW AND 
WHIPPED THEM FROM ONE END OF THE TOWN TO THE OTHER, IN VIEW OF ALL 
THE PEOPLE.^]
<P B3V>
   And so farwell, I haue done your request, if at any
time you haue occasion to vse me, in such a peece of seruice,
command me. [$Away went he very hartily laughing, and
the Fryer and his wench, very heauily weeping.$]
[} (^HOW SMUG WOONE A WAGER OF MAISTER PETER FABELL
BY A TRICKE THAT HE DID.^) }]
   [$As one day (^Maister Peter Fabell^) , (an excellent 
Scholler and well seene in the Arte of Magicke) was
conferring with certaine of his friends, about certaine busines
and imployments, (^Smug^) being in the hearing of them, 
betweene druncke and sober (for he had beene plying the
pitcher in Maister (^Peters^) sellar) ran nodding in amongst the~,
and the very first word he spake to them was,$] how doe you
my Maisters. [$They being in very serious talke, 
vnwilling to be disturbed with his foolish babling, with verie
faire wordes, requested him to leaue them a little, and
within halfe an hower (or such a thing) they would giue
him the hearing of that he had to say to them. But he
(like an importunate begger) tould them he would not
leaue them till he had spoke his minde to Maister (^Peter^) .$]
   [$When they saw there was no remedy, but he would
haue his will,$] come [$ (sayd Maister (^Peter^) $] honest           #
(^Oliuer^) ,
be breefe, vtter thy ignorance roundly, what hast thou to
say to me now? Marry [$quoth (^Smug^) ,$] Maister (^Peter^) , I
heere say you are a very cunning Gentleman, and that
you haue done as many fine trickes and feates in your time
as ere a Jugler in all Europe has done, what will you say
now, if a plaine fellow, a hard-handed laborer, a poore
<P B4R>
leatherne-apron-wearer, do such a cunning tricke, as you M.
(^Peter^) with the helpe of all your great gogle eide, bottle
nosd, blobber-lipt, bladder cheekd, beetle-browed, oxe
headed, detestable Deuils, cannot doe the like. Why honest
(^Smug^) [$qd. M. (^Peter^) $] who or where is he that will do this?
marry [$ (qd. (^Smug^) ) $] I am he. Art thou he [$quoth M.          #

who would thinke thou hadst such trickes in thy budget? I

vse the helpe of some infernall? hast thou no Deuill in thy

me M. (^Peter^) , I cannot indure to looke vpon these filthy
foule-mouthed fire-spitters, no Maister (^Peter^) , what I do, 
I will doe of my extraordinary witt and inuention. Well
let's (heare [$qd. M. (^Peter^) ) $] what is it you will doe? Marry
this Ile doe [$qd. (^Smug^) ,$] Ile set a candle burning in the midst
of this roome where we all are, open and easie to be seen as
my hand: This candle M. (^Togood^) shall see M. (^Dauby^) , M.
(^Douty^) , Mistris (^Friskin^) , and my man (^Ralph^) heere yet you
shall not see it, masse (^Smug^) [$ (quoth M. (^Peter^) ) $] if thou #
canst
doe such a tricke, thou putst me downe indeed. Come
begin, let vs see it done, nay first [$ (quoth (^Smug^) ) $] let vs  #
haue a

M. (^Peter^) ) $] what shall the wadger be? why faith [$ (qd.        #
(^Smug^) ) $]
M. (^Peter^) you know my minde for that, I loue alwayes
when I make a wager, rather to haue it wet then drie,
for you know M. (^Peter^) I am dry of my selfe, and ye say y=e=
word, the wager shall be a dozen of double ale, you know
I am merry (^Smug^) , and merry (^Smug^) must haue his merry
go down, or els he is no body. Well I agree [$ (qd. M. (^Peter^) ) $]
heere is my hand, if thou perform'st what thou hast sayde,
Ile loose & Ile pay it. [$Then (^Smug^) cald for a candle & a
candle stick which when he had, he placed M. (^Peter^) in y=e=
middle of the roome, & set the candle-stick with the candle
burning in it vpon his head:$] now M. (^Peter^) [$sayd hee$] do you  #
see
this candle, why no [$ (qd. M. (^peter^) $] how should I see it? is it
possible for a man to see the crowne of his head? you 
<P B4V>
cannot see it then [$qd. (^Smug^) ,$] no, I cannot see it [$sayd     #
hee.$]
[$Then (^Smug^) demaunded of the rest (before named)
whether they did see [^SOURCE TEXT: sse^] it or no, they all         #
answered I, asking how

al
these see it, and yet you cannot see it, they say they
cannot chuse but see, and yet you say it is impossible for you to
see it.
   Come (^Maister Peter^) , you know what you haue lost? and
there had been a Kingdome laide on it, [$when (^Maister peter^)
saw how prettily (^Smug^) had ouer reached him, he (smiling)
sent for his losses, and in pastime made (^Smug^) take his well
