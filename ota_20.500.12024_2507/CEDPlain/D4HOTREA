   [$ (^Richard.^) $] Ha Neighbour (^Will^) , and
where are you going in
all this haste, if a Man
may be so bold as to ask you the question?
   [$ (^William.^) $] (^Why Neighbor is it possible that
you should not know where I am going?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Yes, it is possible, for as yet I
know not.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Then in good faith sit down upon
this Ale-Bench, and I'le tell ye.^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Be quick then, for I have but a 
little while to stay.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^As quick as you will, good
Neighbor, for if I overstay my Market, I shall buy
but bad Pennyworths.^)
<P 2>
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] VVhy, are you going to Market
then, pray what de'y design to buy that
you fear to come too late?
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Buy Neighbour, why News, new
Minted News, what do you think I intend
to buy, that's the greatest Chaffer now
adays.^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] But pray where is it to be sold?
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Why every where, there is few or
no Markets but what yields little or much,
but at this I am going to they sell it by
Sackfull, setting it up by way of Auction, so that
at the burning of an inch of Candle, and
Two-pence price, a Man may purchase as
much as his Head can bear.^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] VVell, but all the News now
is about (^Fitz-Harris^) , who as 'tis said on
the (^9th^) of (^June^) was Tryed at the 
(^Kings-Bench^) , for the Highest of Treason that
witty Mischief could invent.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^'Tis true Neighbour, and there he
was Cast for his Life, being fairly convicted
of his Treasons.^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] 'Tis but just he should, and
condemned too, nay, after that Drawn,
Hanged and Quartered, who dare
attempt the Deposing and Murthering of
his sacred Majesty, who is the Breath
of our Nostrils, as a worthy Judge was
<P 3>
once pleased to say upon the Bench; and
not only his, but to destroy all our lives
and Liberties, by raising Rebellion and
bring in a (^French^) Power, thereby to
enslave us to the Tyranny of the (^Pope^) .
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Could this be proved against him
upon his Tryal?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Proved, yes, under his own
Hand, and by several witness of candid
Reputations, who swore it positively.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^But in what manner, or by what
means, did he design to accomplish such his 
wicked designs?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] By Libelling the King, to render
him odious to his subjects, by Charging
him with such things as no good Man
can express without horror and
detestation; by endeavouring to set all in a
Flame, or Combustion of Civil VVar,
which should be Carryed on under the
name of the (^Non-Conformists^) , so that the
Father should have been against the Son,
and the Son against the Father, to have
sheath'd their swords in each others
bowels, till all had been weakned and ruin'd,
when as the (^Popish^) Army was to be
raised here, and the powers of (^France^) was to
have broken in upon us, and so to have
born down all before them.
<P 4>
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^That had been sad indeed, for then
our lives had been like Chaff before a
Torrent fire.^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Yes, this had been our case had
this Instrument of (^Rome^) and Hell set on
and mannaged by the art and cunning of
the Jesuitick Policies succeeded.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^But pray how did he go about to
perfect this Design, I have here the measures
he took, but it was so imperfectly related,
that I could make nothing on't.^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] VVhy, he haveing some small
acquaintance with one Mr. (^Everard^) ,
being the Gentleman that was kept so long
in the Tower, he came about the (^21th^) of
(^Febr.^) last to his Chamber, and there
falling into discourse with him about
several matters, began to commiserate him
for the hard usage he had suffered, since
his adhearing to the Protestant Intrest,
telling, him if he would forsake it, and
cleave to the Popish Party, he should
not onely meet with great Rewards, but
likewise be put into places of trust.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And did the Gentleman believe or
give credit to what he said?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Yes, he seemed so to do, but it
was onely to find what he would be at,
for he knew him to be a great Villain.
<P 5>
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Well, and how did he proceed, had
they any farther discourse?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] VVhy then he began to open his
mind, and proposed to him the Indicting
of so venomous and Treasonable a
Libell, that I think no Age e're heard the
like, as for me, my hair stood an end when
I heard it read in Court.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Why, what might it contain that it
struck you with such horror.^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Nay, it contained what I will
not presume to repeat; nor can I liken it
to any thing, unless the Box which
(^Pandora^) sent to (^Epimetheus^) , full fraught with
Plagues and dire destruction.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^But how come this to be discovered?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] VVhy the honest Gentleman,
for so I may well call him for detecting
so horrid a Villany, disclosed the business
to several worthy persons.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^But did he let Fitz-Harris know he
did so?^) [^SOURCE TEXT: Fitz-Harris IN ITALICS.^]
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] No I'le warrant ye, but gave
the more countenance to proceed, and
promised to take his Instructions for
drawing up the Papers, and Appointed
him a time to come for them, when as he
had placed a Gentleman to over-hear the
discourse that passed betwixt them.
<P 6>
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And did he come according to
Appointment?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Yes, he did, and uttered many
Treasonable words, promising the
Gentleman that he should have four Guinnys
from the (^French^) Embassadors Confessor,
and that he should be entred a Pensioner
to the (^French^) King, and have several
Thousand Crowns.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And how did the Gentleman like
this proffer?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Not at all, for he boggled at it,
saying it was a Treasonable Design,
and that he knew not what to think on't;
Think on't (said (^Fitz-Harris^) ) why the
more Treason the better, am not I
deeper concerned in it then you? have not
you my hand for it, and is there not
many great Persons concerned in it, or
words to this effect.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Well, and what was to have been
done with those Papers you speak of just
now, how should they have been disposed of?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] VVhy several Thousands
Coppies were to have been dispersed amongst
the People in Penny-Post Letters, and
many put into Gentlemens pockets, and
they apprehended with them about 'um,
so that it could not chuse but blow up a
<P 7>
flame of horrid mischief, for all the Kings
good subjects were to have been brought
into the Plot, and to be taxed for
endeavouring to raise Rebellion and
Insurrection, so that the Popes Agents thought
themselves Cock-sure of prevailing 
against us, this being their last, but most
dangerous shift, and shew'd it self to be
the very Spawn of the Jesuits, but
Heaven that has hitherto blasted their
Designs, prevented it, and broke the
Cockatrices Egg e're it could be hatched.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And was this Sworn against him at
Tryal.^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] It was, and much more then
I can remember; but stay, I had forgot
one passage that was very material,
which was, That one of the Gentlemen
that gave Evidence against him (whose
known Fidelity renders him of
unspotted Reputation) because he would not be
mistaken, marked the Papers that Mr.
(^Everard^) brought to him, and whilst he
looked through a Crevice, he saw
(^Fitz-Harris^) make several alterations,
crossing out some and putting in other some,
and after he was departed, found those
Papers to be the same he had set his
private Mark upon, and that at the takeing
them up, the Ink was wet.
<P 8>
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And did not they apprehend him at
that time?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] No, but some days after, and
carrying him before a Magistrate, he
confess'd a Treasonable Paper to be his
own hand-writing.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Well, but what answer did he make
to what was sworn against him:^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Truly little or nothing to the
purpose, for he rather strove to Justifie
what he had done, then any ways to deny
or detest against such wicked designs,
insisting that he had been Impeached by the
Commons, and that his cause lay before
them.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Well, and how then, was he ever
the better for that Allegation?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] No, nor could he, for the Court
before had over-ruled that Plea, and all
the Judges of (^England^) given their
opinions, it was in the power of the Court to
Try him.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^But did he produce no Witnesses to
testifie for him?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Yes, several, and many of them
persons of Quality.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And what could they say in his
behalf?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Why truly very little or nothing
<P 9>
that would avoid his Cause, for it was
so foul that no good Subject could any
ways countenance it, but rather their
Evidence tended to his prejudice.
[^NEXT UTTERANCE SHOULD BE THAT OF WILLIAM, NOT RICHARD. THIS
ERRONEOUS SWITCH IN SPEAKER NAMES CONTINUES ONTO PAGE 10.^]
   [$ (^R.^) $] (^Why did he call them, seeing their
Testimonies availed him nothing, and he had
better been without 'um.^)
   [$ (^W.^) $] Why, to prove that he had been
with them from the King about business
of importance.
   [$ (^R.^) $] (^And did they agree he had:^)
   [$ (^W.^) $] Yes, they agreed that he had been
with them, but they did no ways believe
his Majesty sent him.
   [$ (^R.^) $] (^Was that all?^)
   [$ (^W.^) $] No, no, he called several to testifie
that he had received Moneys by his
Majesties Order, the which he would have
put an evil Construction on.
   [$ (^R.^) $] (^And was it proved?^)
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Yes, that he had received about 200 l.
but that it was given him out of Charity, his
own Petition being produced, so that you
may see what a Monster he is.^) [^SOURCE TEXT: "l." IN ITALICS.^]
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Well, but how came he off at last?
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Why, when about fourteen
Witnesses had been heard, the Kings Council
summed up their Evidence to the Jury,
laying open to them the nature of the Crime in
<P 10>
all its horrid Circumstances,; [^SO IN SOURCE TEXT^] and when they
had done, Fitz-Harris addressed himself to
them in a threatning way, bidding them
beware what they did, for his Cause lay before
the Parliament, and that if they found him
Guilty [^SOURCE TEXT: Guily^] his Blood would lye at their           #
doors, and
that he doubted not but that it would be
revenged.^) [^SOURCE TEXT: Fitz-Harris IN ITALICS.^]
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] And do you think they believed
him?
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Nay, I cannot tell as to that, but after
the Court had given in their Charge, they
made some scruples, and seemed not well
satisfied till the Court had given them farther
Instructions; [^THIS LAST UTTERANCE SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO          #
RICHARD. NOW WILLIAM SPEAKS:^] and what did they do then?^)
[^HENCEFORTH SPEAKER NAMES ARE INDICATED CORRECTLY IN THE SOURCE     #
TEXT.^]
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Why then they went out, and
staying near an hour, they returned, and
gave in their Verdict, That he was
Guilty of the High Treason for which
he stood Indicted; which Verdict was
accordingly taken and Recorded: the
Court telling them they had found a
very good Verdict.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And did the People seem pleased
with it?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Yes, and gave such a Hura
as made the Hall ring again.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Well, I wish all Traytors the like
success: but Neighbour, 'tis reported that
<P 11>
one Oliver Plunket another Irish Traytor,
and Titular Arch-Bishop of Dublin, was
Tryed the day before, Pray what became of
him?^) [^SOURCE TEXT: Oliver Plunket, Irish AND Dublin
IN ITALICS.^]
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Why he was found Guilty of
High Treason.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^In what Nature? or where
Committed?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] For the most part in (^Ireland^) , and
the Evidence Sworn against him in
Court, was to this purpose, That he
held Correspondence with the (^French^)
King, and that he was to deliver up
certain Towns upon the Sea-Coast
to the (^French^) , that they might Land
an Army: and farther, that in order to
the leavying War in that Kingdom, he
had made several Collections of monies,
and that he had endeavour'd to compass
the Death of His Majesty, and enslave
that Kingdom to (^Popery^) , and the
Insulting Tyranny of the (^French^) Power.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And was all this prov'd against him
in Court?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Yes, and much more, even by
his own Country-men.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Pray what could he say for himself in
this case?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Why truly little or nothing, for
<P 12>
Treason is always attended with a
guilty Conscience, only he objected against
the Insufficiency of the Witnesses,
alledging he stood Convicted upon record.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^And did he produce those Records
in Court?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] No, but being asked why he had
not done it, his answer was, That he
had not time nor opportunity enough to
procure them.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^But had he no Witnesses to testifie
in his behalf?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] Yes, one or two, I think, but
their Evidence was not any thing
material for his advantage.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Why? did not they speak to the
purpose?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] No, but only endeavour'd to
degrade some of the Kings Evidence, but
could give no grounds for what they
said, it being altogether groundless.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] (^Well, and why did not he send over
for his Witnesses, as he said he would the last
Term, seeing he had time enough allowed
him?^)
   [$ (^Rich.^) $] It's true, he might have done
it; nay, he said he did, but that they
being for the most part Priests, they durst
not come over without His Majesties
