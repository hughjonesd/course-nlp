shortly after paid for suertyshippe and so by this
his ouer kind heart, paying other mens debtes, 
hee grew so poore, and into such necessity, that
he was forced to maintaine his liuing by hedging

within a while after this, Maister (^Hobson^) 
comming into kent, to seeke vp some desperate debts,
came to (^Dartford^) , where finding this poore man
ditching for a groat a day, in pitty of him said$] how
