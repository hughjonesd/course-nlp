[} (^OF THE BIRTH, PARENTAGE AND EDUCATION OF THE KNIGHT OF
FOND LOVE.^) }]

[^IN THE REIGN OF OLIVER, PROTECTOR OF ENGLAND, A MAN NAMED 
CRISPE HAS THREE SONS, TOBY, SAMUEL AND ROWLAND, WHO GROW UP 
DESIRING TO BE EMINENT. THEY ORIGINALLY CONSIDER A CAREER 
IN PHILOSOPHY, MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE OR THE LAW.^]

<P A3V>
[^...^] [$Being thus in a deep Debate, quoth (^Toby^) to
(^Samuel^) :$]
   (^As I am elder then you, so I may perhaps speak as wisely
as you: 'Tis true, I am a Merchant, yet I have idle time 
enough to spare, and can follow any other handsome 
imployment, to waste leisure-hours: Some men follow drinking;
but I cannot maintain quarrels, and therefore I like it not.
Some follow gaming; but there's mischief and danger in
that, too, especially if a man question the Dice; so that I 
abjure it. Therefore I am of opinion, that there is no Art
so suitable to our Dispositions, as the Art of Love; 'Tis a
fine Calling, and a civil: for, Ladies, Brother, will not only
not fight, but love; and doubtless love us, being proper and
handsome: Besides, Brother, as I take it, there is a Duty
lying upon young men, to serve and wait upon young Ladies
and Gentlewomen^) .
   [$ (^Toby^) having ended this Speech, Samuel shouted for joy,
saying to his Brother, that he was wiser then (^Solomon^) , and
had more discretion then his (^Namesake^) , who was Judge of
(^Israel^) :$] But Brother, two hearts are better then one; and
therefore, as you have begun the invention, you shall see how
bravely I will contrive the rest: For you must know, 
Brother, that before we can practise this Art, to wait upon 
Ladies, as we should do, we must be knighted, and assume unto
our selves certain Titles, after we have studied those things
which are most requisite to accomplish us. Thus was St.
(^George^) knighted before he could conquer the Dragon, for the
<P A4R>
Kings Daughters sake, and was called, (^The Knight of the 
Red Cross^) . So likewise, the Grocers Apprentice, before
he could be fit to wait on his Mistresses daughter, was 
knighted, and called, (^The Knight of the Burning Pestle^) . First,
therefore, let us learn to dance, then let us read the several
Books and Treatises that may better our complemental
Language, and then I shall not question but to find out some
person or other, who may give us our Order.

[^THE TWO BROTHERS PROCEED IN THEIR STUDIES AND ARE GIVEN 
INSTRUCTION BY MEN INCLUDING SIR CHANNEL. THEY ALSO ACQUIRE 
NEW CLOTHING.^]

<P A4V>
[^---^] [$For going to 
(^Fleetstreet^) , one of these young persons happened to be adry;
and seeking for an Ale-house, they lighted in at the sign of
the (^Buff-coat^) : they called for Ale; 'twas asked whether
(^Eleemosynary^) , or other Ale? they replyed,$] What Ale's
that? [$quoth the Squire,$] This is the Castle of Sir (^Pemmel^) ,
Knight of the (^Eleemosynary^) Ale, as being that Liquor with
which most commonly, he relieves distressed Knights: 
[$whereupon they sent for the Knight, who coming courteously unto
them, they demanded several Questions; and among the rest,
whether he had power to make Knights. Sir (^Pemmel^)
replyed, That he had; and that, if they pleas'd, he could erect
new Orders: at which they received great satisfaction, 
desiring to be made Knights also: and having heard a 
Catalogue of Orders read to them, they at length pitched upon the 
(^Order of Fond Love^) : which being determined, the Laws
were produced and read.$]
[^THE MEN'S EARS ARE INITIALLY EDGED WITH BLACK WOOL AS A SYMBOL 
THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY ADHERE TO THESE LAWS AND THEN, AS THEY

Fire-Fork on their shoulders, bid them,$] (^Rise up Sir Toby, and Sir
Samuel Crispe, Knights of the Order of Fond Love^) . [$After
this, they thank'd Sir (^Pemmel^) for his civility, and gave the
Squire the odde peny which was over and above the 
reckoning, and so departed. Then resolving to have but one
Squire between them, to save charges, they went and hired
(^Jack Waterhouse^) , who readily agree'd to serve them for five 
shillings a quarter, and their old silk Stockings.$]

[^AFTER A SUMMER OF VISITING CHURCH IN ORDER TO ACQUAINT HIMSELF 
WITH THE LADIES, SIR SAMUEL IS SUDDENLY "STRUCK" BY CUPID'S BOW. 
LOVE-SICK, HE INSTRUCTS HIS SQUIRE TO FOLLOW THE LADY (ELIZABETHA) 
TO SEE WHERE SHE LIVES, AND THEN GOES HOME.^]
[^...^] [$At length, impatient of delay, he uttered his woes 
in this sort:$] Oh most unfortunate of men, and most 
wretched of young men! unhappy eyes! why were ye not asleep,
asleep at Church, where most eyes have the happiness to sleep,
but waking, to see your Destruction? To what purpose am
I black and comely, straight and proper, but that women
should be in love with me? and must I be now in love with
woman? but I am in love, & cannot help it for my heart and
guts. O (^Elizabetha, Elizabetha Tottel^) , thou hast undone
(^Samuel Crispe^) . [$By this time his good Squire (^Jack Waterhouse^)
came in, and told him where his (^Elizabetha^) lay: whereupon,
calling for Pen, Ink and Paper, he thus wrote unto her.$]

[^SIR SAMUEL GIVES THE LOVE LETTER TO HIS SQUIRE TO TAKE TO 
ELIZABETHA. HOWEVER, SHE GIVES IT TO HER CHAMBER-MAID, WITH 
INSTRUCTIONS THAT SHE MAKE USE OF IT IN THE GARDEN. MEANWHILE,

VISIT ELIZABETHA.^]

[} (^HOW SIR SAMUEL COURTED ELIZABETHA, AND HOW THE 
CHAMBER-MAID AFFRONTED HIM; AND WHAT HAPPENED THEREUPON.^) }]

   [$Sir (^Samuel^) being now in the presence of his Mistress,
though at first he were a little daunted at the Majestie
of her person, yet finding that he must either speak, or be
counted a Puppy, for coming to visit a Lady, and saying 
nothing; he addressed himself, after a leg or two made in mood
and figure, in these following words.$]
   (^Madam, seeing the painted cloth of your vertues hang
out at the window, and Fame standing at the door with
a Trumpet in her hand, I could not chuse, out of a natural
inclination which I have to fights and Puppet-plays, but
step in and behold the monstrousness of your beauties: and
now Madam I have seen you, I admire you more then the
hairy Gentlewoman.^) [$Donna (^Elizabetha^) reply'd, That
truly his person was very proper, and his language was 
very eloquent: but withal she told him, that she was very 
sorry that he had put himself to so great a trouble, since she
found by him (for she could see as far into a Milstone as 
another) that he was not for her turn. But he confidently, 
as being now over shooes over boots, returns her answer,
That she had created love within him, and that he hoped
she would not cause it to be born and die at the same instant:
and therefore he petitions her again, in these words:$] (^Most
celestial beam of beauty, I have received you into my heart,
which like a Burning-glass contracting the heat of your rays,
is now all on fire, not to be quenched but by the moistning
Julep of your affection; and therefore do not deny me
life, since it is altogether in your power to give it^) . [$To
which she jestingly replies, that she was sorry she could not
<P B3R>
subscribe his petition: yet she was glad to see him, for that
she never saw a Phenix before; which she conjectured                 #
[^SOURCE TEXT: conjectued^] him
to be, because he went about to die in his flames. However,
if that were not his intention, rather then he should be
scorched to death for love of her, that could not requite him,
she would cause her Maid to make water in a bason, that
he might bathe and quench his burning brest therein. Sir
(^Samuel^) thanked her, telling her withal, that any stream of
her kindness would be acceptably received into his bosome.$]
(^But wo is me^) , [$ (said he, proceeding) $] (^for I finde my words
have made no more impression in your heart, then an 
arrow on a rock of Adamant: so that I may say of you, that
as in the greenest grass is the greatest serpent, in the clearest
water the ugliest toad; so is your fair body lin'd with a
cruel soul. Alas, you have no mercy on my Captivity; so
that I am like the spaniel, that gnaws his chain, but sooner
spoils his teeth then procures liberty. But as a bladder
is to a learning swimmer, so is Hope to me; which makes
me apt to believe, that as there is no iron but will be  
softned with the fire; so there is no heart, how hard soever, 
that will not be softned by continual prayers. Consider, 
that the sun disdains not to shine upon the smallest worm.
Reconcile your self to the humblest of your vassals, and do
not through Marble-heartd cruelty overwhelm him with
sense-distracting grief^) -- [$He would have said more; but
(^Elizabetha^) impatient of his impertinencies, flung in great
haste out of the Room, not so much as staying to see him
make his retiring honour.$]
   [$Being thus pensively left alone, the Chamberlain comes
down, and seeing Sir (^Samuel^) in such a sad condition, she 
accosts him, telling him, that though he had not the way, yet
she knew how well enough to prevail with her Mistriss;
assuring him withal, that for five pieces she would make him
possessour of the happiness he sought to enjoy. Sir (^Samuel^)
shak'd his head at this, telling her, That it was for ought he
knew, more then he should receive for her portion; but if five
shillings would content her, it was at her service. At which
words, the Maid discovering the pitiful humour of Sir
<P B3V>
(^Samuel^) , disdaining his profer, called him Sad Fellow, and
Mole-catcher, telling him he did not deserve a 
Kitchin-wench: and as he went out of doors, she pinned a sheet of
brown Paper to the Cape of his Cloak; which though it
were not written, yet gave many people as he went in the
streets, an opportunity sufficient to read the Character of the
man.$]

[^---^] [$and having 
something more to deliver to her then his Knight imposed upon
him, he spewed upon her shooes, thereby enigmatically 
setting forth the streams of his Masters affection: raised again
at length upon his Legs, he began his Speech:$] Madam
[$quoth he,$] --- hickup --- my Master --- hickup --- hath sent you
some --- hickup --- some Verses; wherein --- hickup --- he hath
declared --- hickup --- the reality --- hickup --- of his affections

in your face. -- [$The Lady (^Elizabetha^) , seeing the young
Squire in such a condition, and that he wanted lodging,
caused him to be conveyed out of doors into the Porch, where
he lay till the Watch came by: who then took him, and 
put him in the Round-house; whence being set at 
liberty, he went to Sir (^Samuel^) , relating to him his, and his own
doleful misfortunes.$]

   [$Leaving now Sir (^Samuel^) in the Country, let us see
what becomes of Sir (^Toby^) , and (^Lawrence^) the younger
of the three Brethren. These two being acquainted with
a Lady of great beauty, happened both to fall in love with
her. Sir (^Toby^) thought he deserved her best, as being the
elder Brother and a Knight: (^Lawrence^) thought she ought
to love him best, as having thrown his affections first upon
her. However, there happened great contention between
them, so that they lived in perpetual strife. (^Lawrence^)
willing to reconcile the difference;$] (^Brother^) , [$said he,$]    #
(^you
know how good a thing it is for Brethren to agree 
together: You and I, 'tis true, love one and the same Lady;
now to reconcile this difference, I will propose three
things to you, and let him that wins her, take her; that is,
either let us play first come to three hits at Ticktack for her,
or let us play an hundred and threescore up at Trap-ball
for her; or let us play at push-pin, and he that wins the first
five pins, let him take her a Gods name^) . [$Sir (^Toby^) , though
he could not but confess these three Propositions to be very
reasonable, yet being blinded with love, he continued 
obstinate, and would yeild to nothing: which caused great 
anger in (^Lawrence^) , so that now in all companies, he curses his
Brother, wishing him hang'd and at the Devil; and hath a 
great pick at his Mother for bringing him forth to be his
Rival.$]

SHEPHERD DISGUISE CAUSES HIM TO BE ARRESTED AS A SPY AND FINED!  
ON HIS RELEASE, HE CONTINUES HIS JOURNEY AND COMES UPON TWO 
DISTRESSED WOMEN IN A FOREST NEAR TUNBRIDGE.^]
[^...^] [$The Voyce caused him to draw near,
and drawing near, he discovered two young Ladies sitting in
a fair green Plat, bewailing their misfortunes. Sir 
(^Samuel^) moved with compassion, accosts them; and having 
demanded some questions of them, told them, He was a 
forsaken Lover, as he ghessed them to be, being a Knight of the
Order of (^Fond Love^) . Whereupon one of the Ladies 
discovering in his Physiognomie, that the man might 
easily be made an Ass;$] (^Sir^) , [$quoth she, casting her self at  #
his
feet,$] (^if you be such a one as you pretend, have compassion
on a distressed Lady: I have lost my Maiden-head, and
prove with Child; therefore I desire you to marry me, to
take off all reproach that the world may cast either on my
Child, or my self^) . [$To which Sir (^Samuel^) replyed:$] 
(^Madam, you being a Lady, and I a Knight, I should be no Knight
should I not be kind to you a Lady^) . [$Then quoth she,$] Since
neer relations ought to be more familiar, (^let us sit down
together on the grass^) : [$to which the Knight readily 
consented. Then she proceeding:$] (^My pretty dear^) , [$quoth she,$]
(^suppose that I being thy wife, should ask thee for ten or
twenty pieces to sport away at Cards, would you deny it
me? No, as I hope to be saved^) , [$answered Sir (^Samuel^) :$]
<P C3R>
(^but suppose I should come and give thee a little box on the
ear, and say, My Dear, let me see thy pockets, and so take out
all thy money, wouldst thou be angry? No indeed law^) , 
[$answered Sir (^Samuel^) . With that she gave him a sweet kiss,
and putting her hand into his Fob, took out all she could
find; neither was she slow to secure it again in her own 
pockets. Then quoth she,$] (^My dear, you have rings on, which
are doubtless the Enchantments which cause me and other
women to love thee so: preethee let me see 'em^) : [$and so
without more Complements, she takes them off. Sir 
(^Samuel^) , who had more of courtesie then craft, suffered all this.
The Lady now well ballasted, of a suddain starts up, cries
out,$] (^Theeves, Theeves^) , [$and runs away as hard as she could
drive: Sir (^Samuel^) ran after; but at length finding them
too swift, and considering that he had left his Cloak and
Hat behind, he desisted from the chase, for fear of loosing all.
Sir (^Samuel^) all this while thought this had been only a 
lovetrick, and expected to hear from them next morning; but 
the fifth and sixth day passing without any tidings, he 
concluded himself puppyfi'd, and cursed the day of his birth.$]

[} (^HOW SIR SAMUEL COUNTERFEITED HIMSELF DEAD, TO GET PITY FROM
HIS ELIZABETHA, AND HOW HE DATED A LETTER TO HER FROM
HIS GRAVE.^) }] 

   [$Sir Samuel finding by this time, that neither his person
nor his parts could move his (^Elizabetha^) , resolved to
play the crafty Fox, and to overcome her by slight. Oh the
suttle inventions of love! for you shall hear what a strange
Whim came into his Noddle. Said he to himself:$]
Women are tender Creatures, and they have soft and tender
breasts, and in those tender breasts lodgeth pity and 
compassion. They will revile and scorn a man at this instant, but
let the same person cut his finger in their company, and
<P C3V>
the next, they will give him the sugar, sweetest words of pity
that a Woman can give to a Man. Let a Man fain himself
sick for love of them, and their hearts will melt like Ice
before the Fire: If then they will do so much for those that
are sick for love, what will they not do for those that shall dye
for love? I will dye for love of (^Elizabetha^) , and cause her 
affections to come like Butter, being charmed by the 
compassion of her soul towards me. 
[^SIR SAMUEL THEN DISPATCHED HIS SQUIRE, JACK WATERHOUSE, WITH 
INSTRUCTIONS THAT HE INFORM ELIZABETHA OF THE GRAVE ILLNESS THAT 
HAD SUDDENLY BEFALLEN HIM!^]
[^...^] I go, [$said (^Jack

little
heart of yours, which is no bigger then a Hasle Nut, and be
of good comfort. [^...^]

SOME FUN. EVEN THOUGH SHE DOES NOT LOVE HIM, SHE INSISTS THAT HE
SHOULD COME AND SEE HER. JACK WATERHOUSE RETURNS TO INFORM HIS

(^Elizabetha^) .$]
He loves you, Madam, [$answered Sir (^Toby^) ;$] you your self
are the cause of his Maladies; and dye doubtlesse he must
and will, if you continue in obstinacy. [$As he was 
conversing the Story, to confirm the truth thereof, in comes a 
Letter from Sir (^Samuel^) to direct to the fair (^Elizabetha^) : it
was brought by (^Jack VVaterhouse^) , with tears in his eyes,
having left his Master laid out in his Winding Sheet for
dead.$] [^...^] 

<S SAMPLE 8>
<P C4V>
   [$ (^Elizabetha^) having read this Letter, asked (^Jack 
VVaterhouse^) if his Master were mad; and why he troubled her
with such impertinence; telling him withal, That she was
now in good company, and could not leave them: besides,
she never cared for seeing dead men: and therefore she 
desired (^Jack VVaterhouse^) to bury him well; letting him
know withal, that if he had left her a Legacy, she was 
willing to receive it. With this Message (^Jack VVaterhouse^)
returned; and Sir (^Samuel^) seeing his Metropolitan 
Designe fail him, hearing the Exchange-Bell ring, rose again,
and went about his business.$]

to put off his Squire (^Jack Waterhouse^) ; who being 
thereupon destitute, returned again to his old Master Sir            #
(^Channel^) .
Now there being a great meeting of Knights and Ladies
at his Castle, who had heard of the Adventures of Sir

little entreaties he did, in this following Character.$]
