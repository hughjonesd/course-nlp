[$Sir (^Edward Mosely^) Barronet
endited for Felony and Rape,
upon the Body of one (^Anne
Swinnerton^) , (Wife to one Mr.
(^Swinnerton^) a Gentleman of
(^Grays^) Inne) This triall was
taken the 28=th= day of (^January^) , in the 23 yeare
of King (^Charles, An. Dom.^) 1647. Before Mr. Justice
(^Bacon^) and Master Justice (^Rolls^) in (^Hillary^) Terme
(^ (\Banco Regis\) ^) .$]
   [$First, Sir (^Edward Mosely^) appear'd at the Bar
and pleaded not guilty; Then Master
(^Swinnerton^) and his Wife appear'd to give
evidence, Then the Court demanded of Master
<P 2>
(^Swinnerton^) what councell hee had ready to open
the Inditement, Master (^Swinnerton^) answered,
that there had been such tampering with him
and his witnesses to stop the prosecution, That
he could get no Lawyers to open his Wifes case.
The Court asked him whether he had spoken
with any Lawyers to be of his councell, Hee
said hee had, but none would undertake it,
onely Master (^Cooke^) had promised him that he
would open the Inditement for him, but hee
appeares not, So that by the tampering of
Sir (^Edward Mosely^) , Master (^Lowder^) , Master (^Ia. 
Win-Stanly^) , Master (^Blore^) , and Master
(^Brownell^) and twenty more, none would assist him
in the maintaining of the Inditement. These
Gentlemen before named appeared in Court,
and did not deny, but that they did use what
meanes they could (in a faire way) to put
up the businesse, betwixt Sir (^Edward Mosely^)
and Mistris (^Swinnerton^) , which they conceived
they might lawfully doe, believeing it could
not possibly be a Rape, having had
intelligence of some former passages in it; Then the
Court said,$] Master (^Swinnerton^) if you had
desired councell, the Court would have assigned
you councell. [$Then Master (^Swinnerton^)
proceeded with his evidence (saying) $] comming
home to my Chamber, about six of the
clock in (^April^) 1647. I found Sir (^Edward
Mosely^) came rushing out of my Chamber, and I
<P 3>
entring saw my Wife throwne upon the ground;
with all her cloathes torne, the Bed-cloathes
torne and hanging halfe way upon the ground,
my Wife crying and wringing her hands,
with her clothes all torne off her head, her
wrist sprained, Sir (^Edward Mosely^) having
throwne her violently upon the ground,
whereupon (seeing her in this condition) I asked
her what was the matter, shee said Sir
(^Edward Mosely^) had Ravisht her, [$Master
(^Swinnerton^) further enformed the Court, That$] Sir
(^Edward Mosely^) two or three dayes before he
did the Rape, sayd that he would ravish my
Wife though hee were sure to be hang'd for
it, [$Then Mistris (^Swinnerton^) began her
evidence, saying,$] upon my Oath here I sweare,
That hee sayd hee would force mee to my
Bed, and then hee swore God damme him,
Hee would lie with mee though hee were
sure to die for it, Then hee takes mee and
carries mee to a narrow place, betwixt the
wall of the Bed, and with his hands forst
my hands behinde mee, and lay with mee
whether I would or no, [$Then Sir (^Edward
Mosely^) interrupted her, saying,$] did not your
Husband come to the Chamber doore at that
time you pretended you were Ravisht, and
knockt at the Doore, and I would have
opened the Doore for him, whereupon you
sayd it is my Husband; Let the drunken sot
<P 4>
stay without, and would not suffer mee to
open the Doore, [$and asked her whether shee
did not say so, shee sayd it was false, Then
the Court demanded of Master (^Swinnerton^)
what hee said to his Wife when hee found
her in this manner, Master (^Swinnerton^)
answered,$] I sayd that if shee were ravisht as
shee sayd shee was, shee must take her Oath
of it, and indite him for it, [$and if shee did
not hee would believe, that shee had playd
the Whore with him, and hee would turne
her off, and live no more with her, and
shee should be Sir (^Edward Moselies^) Whore
altogether,$] but [$ (sayd hee) $] being desirous
to be further satisfyed in the businesse I
often sought for Sir (^Edward Mosely^) , but could
not finde him, for he had fled away from his
Chamber.
   One day I met him accidentally in Holborne,
and desired to speake a word with him, he said
he knew my businesse, but he was in hast and
could not stay; Then I told him I had earnest
businesse with him, and I must speake with him,
he told me he suspected I had some designe to
arrest him, and would not be perswaded to stay,
then I prest him that if he would goe and drink
a cup of Ale with me, he should come in no 
danger concerning any arrest at all; and if he
then would give me satisfaction, I would not
prosecute the Law against him: [$The Court
<P 5>
demanded of him what he meant by satisfaction,$]
   [$Master (^Swinnerton^) answered,$] onely to know
what he could say to excuse himselfe, [$the Court
said,$] why, would you believe him before your
Wife? [$Master (^Swinnerton^) answered,$] my
meaning was, if he could satisfie me that my Wife
was consenting to it, I had rather wave the
prosecution, then bring my Wife and my selfe
upon the Stage, and this was my intent and no
other.
   [$Then the Court asked Sir (^Edward Moseley^) how
Master (^Swinnertons^) Wife came to be so with
her cloathes torne and rufled in this manner
(none but hee and she being in the Roome) Sir
(^Edward Moseley^) answered, she alwayes went
very ill favourdly in her apparrell: Then the
Court asked Mistris (^Swinnerton^) whether there
were any in the roome but Sir (^Edward^) and her
selfe, She answered,$] a little before there was
my Maide, but I had sent her to the Bakers
house for bread for my Children, and in the
meane while he lay with me against my will.
   [$Then the Court asked the Maide what shee
could say, she said,$] when I came from the
Bakers, and entring into the chamber, I found
my Mistris crying, and wringing her hands,
saying she was undone; Also I heard Sir
(^Edward Moseley^) say, before I went to the Bakers,
that he would lie with my Mistris though he
were sure to be hang'd for it, and at all times
<P 6>
hee was wont to bee very uncivill and rude
when hee came into the Chamber, once hee
came into the Chamber when I was there
alone, truly I durst not stay in the
Chamber, for I alwayes observed, Hee was so
lecherously given that any Woman were shee
never so meane would serve his turne; At
this time hee came into the Chamber a little
before I went to the Bakers, I observed
hee would faine have throwne my Mistris
upon the Bed when I was there, but my
Mistris would not yeeld to it, but grew
very angry with him, and said hee was a rogue,
and spit in his face, yet hee would not let
her alone, whereupon I told him, if hee
would not be more civill, I would call my
Master, and if hee came hee would crack his
crowne for using my Mistris so uncivilly, Sir
(^Edward Mosely^) answered hee cared not a
fart for my Master, and that for mee I was
a base Jade, and hee would make mee kisse
his, &c. [$what said the Court, but the Maid
having some modesty could not bring it out,
then said her Mistris,$] he said she should kisse
something that was about him, what was that
[$said the Court againe, Master (^Swinnerton^)
answered,$] he said he would make her kisse his
Arse, [$then the Court said to the Maide,$] you
must not be so nice in speaking of the truth,
being upon your Oath, [$Mistris (^Swinnerton^) said$]
<P 7>
then came Master (^Ja. Winstanley^) to tamper
with me from Sir (^Edward Moseley^) , and told me
if I pleas'd to accept a hundred pounds, I
should have it, if I would be reconciled to
Sir (^Edward Moseley^) ; [$Then the Maide said,$]
my Mistris made this answer, shee cared not
for Money: [$Mistris (^Swinnerton^) said,$] it is true
I said so; and this I said, If Sir (^Edward
Moseley^) would downe upon his knees and
confesse that he had wronged me, I would not
prosecute him; But also I resolved that he should
weare a Paper upon his Breast, or upon his
Hatt, acknowledging the injury hee had done
unto mee: if hee would doe so I would
forgive him. [$Then said shee,$] Master (^Ia.
Winstanley^) desired to know where the place was
in the roome where I was ravisht;
whereupon I shewed him. Master (^Ia. Winstanley^)
answered, this was such a place for such a 
businesse, that if I had the strongest woman
in England, I could ravish her here whether
she would or no.
   [$Then the Prosecutors for the King having
ended their evidence: The Court asked Sir
(^Edward Moseley^) what hee could say for
himselfe; He said, hee had many witnesses, and
desired that they might bee examined what
they could say in his behalfe.$]
   [$Then Master (^Kilvert^) was called in, who
appeared; The Court said,$] Master (^Kilvert^)
<P 8>
though you bee not upon your Oath, you
must speake the truth in the feare of God,
[$Master (^Kilvert^) answered,$] I know it my Lord;
what I shall say here, I speake it in the
presence of God, and I shall speake no more
then what is truth: [$Mistris (^Swinnerton^)
seeing of him, said$] I hope no body will believe
what this Knave (^Kilvert^) will say, for he is
a Knave knowne to all the Court, and all
that heare him. [$Then Master (^Kilvert^) went
on with his evidence, saying,$] I thanke God
this is the second time I ever came in this
womans company; the first time was at the
Fleece Taverne in Covent-Garden, where
shee came to a Dinner to meete with Sir
(^Edward Moseley^) : As soone as shee had set
downe at the Table, shee said, that this
Roome had bin a very lucky Roome to
her, for once before in this Roome, shee
had received three hundred pounds for the
composition of a Rape, which shee charged
a Reverend Divine withall, I shall not stick
to name the man, shee said it was Doctor
(^Belcanquell^) ; this Doctor I knew him to be a
reverend man, and to my knowledge is long
since dead, and in Heaven; and for this Rape,
shee said then, shee would not take under
two thousand pounds for a composition of
Sir (^Edward Moseley^) , which shee said was
little enough, hee having three thousand pounds
<P 9>
a yeere. [$Mistris (^Swinnerton^) hearing of this
clapt her hands at him, and said, he was a
Knave, and a Rascall, and all was false which 
he said.$]
   [$Then the Court said to her, Mistris
(^Swinnerton^) $] you should carry your selfe soberly
and moderately, otherwise you will
disparage all your witnesses. [$Then the Court
asked her whether shee did meete at this
Taverne (having affirmed before that shee
never was in Sir (^Edward Moselys^) company but
in her owne chamber) whereupon shee
staggered at it a little and loath to confesse it,
at last shee answered, True, shee was there,
but this Rascall (^Kilvert^) had bewitcht her to
come thither. Master (^Kilvert^) said further,$]
after shee had sate a while at the Table, she
takes her stoole and removes it to sit next to
Sir (^Edward Moseley^) , and there falls hugging
and imbracing him; whereupon said hee,
surely Lady whereas you say Sir (^Edward^) hath
ravisht you, I doe beleive rather you have
ravisht him, otherwise you would not make
so much of him, [$so Master (^Kilvert^) made an end of
his evidence.$]
   [$Then Master (^Wood^) another witnesse, said
he met her at Islington in Sir (^Edward Moseleys^)
company, and there shee confest to him that
Sir (^Edward Moseley^) had many times left the
Key of his Chamber with her, to goe to
<P 10>
him when shee pleased; and shee said, shee
had often made use of it. Then said this
witnesse,$] after I had seriously look't upon
her, and seeing of her a woman of that
strength and body, I said, I wondred Sir (^Edward
Moseley^) should ravish her: She said, do you
wonder at that, why? doe you take me behinde
the Bed there (there being a Bed in the
Roome) and see whether you may not doe
it.
   [$Another witnesse said that shee had
confest to him that Sir (^Edward Moseley^) once lay
with her, with her consent;$] afterwards shee
asked him, now what will you give my Maide
you must give her something? he answered,
Ile give her fourty shillings, whereupon shee 
said, fourty shillings, that's base, you cannot
give her lesse then ten pound and a Silke
Petticoate; But saith shee, when he went
forth of Doores, shee said he gave her
nothing but a Groat, and so basely went his
way.
   [$Another Witnesse sayd hee heard her say,
(that it being generally knowne that Sir
(^Edward Moseley^) had ravisht her) shee was like to
loose many of her best customers in Town.$]
   [$Another Witnesse sayd he heard (^Swinnerton^)
say, that if she would not take her Oath that she
was ravisht by him she should never be no Wife
of his: Afterwards Mr. (^Ia. Winstanly^) was called
<P 11>
into the Court, Hee said,$] tis true shee tooke
mee, and shewed mee the place where shee
was ravisht. [$Hee woundring how Sir (^Edward^)
being but a little Man and shee such a lusty
Woman should bee ravisht by him!$] Why
sayd shee should you wonder at that? Then
shee put her Leg betweene my Legges, and
put her other Legge setting her Foote against
the Wall, saying now in this posture as you
see mee here, I my selfe could ravish any Woman
whatsoever.
   [$Another Witnesse sayd,$] the night before
shee went to preferre the Bill of Inditement
against Sir (^Edward Moseley^) , shee confest shee
had like to have beene distracted and runne
mad, for feare the Grand Jury should finde the
Bill.
   [$Two other Witnesses affirmed upon their
credit, whereas it was sayd by Master
(^Swinnerton^) and his Wife, That Sir (^Edward Moseley^)
fled from his Chamber immediately
after the act was done, They said they had
daily recourse to his Chamber, and walkt to
and fro with him, sometimes in (^Grayes^) 
Inne-walkes, sometimes to Westminster, and to other
places in the Towne for six Weekes together,
after this pretended Rape, and many times
they saw Mistris (^Swinnerton^) stand at her owne
doore looking upon him, as hee past by
(which was but six steps from Sir (^Edwards^)
<P 12>
Chamber doore) and never questioned
about it, but oftentimes (they said) seeing
her stand watching there, they feared shee
would go up to him, and tempt him to
wickednesse.$]
   [$Then evidence being given on both sides, the
Jury went from the Barre and returned, and
gave their Verdict, That Sir (^Edward Moseley^)
was not guilty, Then the Court sayd Sir
(^Edward Moseley^) ,$] take heede what company you
keepe hereafter, Let this be a warning to
you, you see in what danger you bring
your selfe to in keeping ill
Company.
