[}ACT I. SCENE I.}]

[$Failer (^entring to^) Burr; (^who is putting on his Buff-Coat^) .$]

[$ (^Fail.^) $] What! Not ready yet, Man?
[$ (^Burr.^) $] You do not consider my Voyage from
(^Holland^) last night.
[$ (^Fail.^) $] Pish, a meer Ferry, get up, get up; my
Cousins Maids will come and Blanket thee
anon: Art thou not ashamed to lie a Bed so long?
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] I may be more ashamed to rise; and so you'l say,   #
dear Heart,
if you look upon my Cloaths; the best is, my Buff-coat will cover
all.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] I gad, there goes more cunning than one would     #
think, to the
putting thy Cloaths together: thy Doublet and Breeches are Guelphs
and Ghibellins to one another; and the stiches of thy Doublet are
<P 2>
so far asunder, that it seems to hang together by the Teeth. No
Man could ever guess to what part of the Body these fragments did
belong, unless he had been acquainted with u'm as long as thou hast
been. If they once lose their hold, they can never get together
again, except by chance the Rags hit the Tallies of one another. He
that gets into thy Doublet, must not think to do't by storme; no, he
must win it inch by inch, as the (^Turk^) did (^Rhodes^) .
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] You are very merry with my Wardrobe: but till I am
provided of a better, I am resolv'd to receive all Visits in this
Truckle-bed.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Then I will first scotch the Wheels of it, that   #
it may not
run; thou hast Cattle enough in it, to carry it down stairs, and
break thy neck. 'tis got a yard nearer the door already.

[$ (^Enter^) Boy.$]

   Sir, Mr. (^Bibber^) your Taylor's below, and desires to speak with
you.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] He's an honest Fellow, and a fashionable, he      #
shall set thee
forth I warrant thee.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] I, but where's the Money for this dear Heart?
   [$ (^Fail^) $] -- Well, but what think you of being put into a    #
[$ (^aside.^) $]
Suit of Cloaths, without Money?
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] You speak of Miracles.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Do you not know (^Will. Bibbers^) humor?
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Prethee, What have I to do with his humor?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Break but a Jest, and he'll beg to trust thee for #
a Suit; nay,
he will contribute to his own destruction; and give thee occasions
to make one: he has been my Artificer these three years; and, all
the while I have liv'd upon his favourable apprehension: Boy,
conduct him up. [$ (^Exit^) Boy.$]
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] But, What am I the better for this? I ne'r made   #
Jeast in
all my life.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] A bare clinch will serve the turn; a Carwichet, a
Quarterquibble, or a Punn.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Wit from a Low-Countrey-Soldier? One that has
convers'd with none but dull (^Dutchmen^) these ten yeares! What an
unreasonable Rogue art thou? why, I tell thee, 'tis as difficult to  #
me,
as to pay him ready Money.
<P 3>
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Come, you shall be rul'd for your own good, Lie   #
down;
I'll throw the Cloaths over you to help Meditation; and, upon the
first opportunity, start you up, and surprise him with a Jeast.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Well, I think this impossible to be done: but,    #
however I'll
attempt.
[$ (^Lies down^) Failer (^covers him^) .$]
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Husht! he's coming up.

[$ (^Enter^) Bibber.$]
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Morrow Mr. (^Failer^) : What, I warrant you think  #
I come a
Dunning now?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] No, I vow to Gad, (^Will^) , I have a better      #
opinion of thy
Wit, than to think, thou would'st come to so little purpose.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Pretty well that: No, no; my business is to drink  #
my 
mornings-Draught in Sack with you:
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Will not Ale serve the turn, (^Will^) ?
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] I had too much of that last night; I was a little  #
disguis'd,
as they say.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Why disguis'd? Hadst thou put on a clean Band, or #
wash'd
thy Face lately? those are thy Disguises, (^Bibber^) .
   [$ (^Bibb.^) $] Well, in short, I was drunk; damnably drunk with  #
Ale;
great Hogen Mogen bloody Ale: I was porterly drunk, and that I
hate of all things in Nature.
   [$ (^Burr. Rising:^) $] And of all things in Nature I love it best.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Art thou there I'faith; and why, old Boy?
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Because when I am porterly drunk, I can carry my  #
self.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Ha, ha Boy.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] This Porter brings sad Newes to you (^Will^) ,    #
you must trust
him for a suit of Cloathes, as bad as 'tis: come, h's as honest
Fellow, and loves the King.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Why? it shall be my Suit to him, that I may trust  #
him.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] I grant your Suit, Sir,
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] (^Burr.^) Make hast and dress you: Sir            #
(^Timorous^) Dines here to
day you know him.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] I, I a good honest young Fellow; but, no          #
Conjurer; he
and I are very kind.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] I gad we two have a constant Revenue out of him:  #
he
would now be admitted Suitor to my Lady (^Constance Nonsuch^) ,
<P 4>
my Lord (^Nonsuch^) his Daughter; our Neighbour here in              #
(^Fleetstret^) .
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Is the Match in any forwardness?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] He never saw her before yesterday, and will not   #
be brought
to speak to her this Moneth yet.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] That's strange.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Such a bashful Knight did I never see; but we     #
must move
for him.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] They say here's a great Dinner to be made to day   #
here, at
your Cousin (^Trices^) , on purpose for the enterview.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] What he keeps up his old humor still?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Yes certain; he admires eating and drinking well, #
as much as
ever, and measures every mans wit, by the goodness of his
Palate.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Who Dines here besides.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] (^Jac. Loveby.^) 
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] O, my Ghest.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] He has ever had the repute of a brave             #
clear-spirited Fellow.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] He's one of your Dear Hearts, a Debauche.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] I love him the better for't: the best Heraldry of a
Gentleman is a Clap deriv'd to him, from three Generations: What     #
fortune
has he?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Good Fortune at all Games; but no Estate: he had  #
one;
but he has made a Devil on't long ago: he's a bold Fellow, I vow
to Gad: a person that keeps company with his betters; and
commonly has Gold in's pockets: come (^Bibber^) ; I see thou longest #
to
be at thy mornings watering: I'll try what credit I have with the
Butler.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Come away my noble Festus and new Customer.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Now will he drink till his Face be no bigger than a
three-pence.
[$ (^ (\ (Exeunt.\) ^) $]
<P 5>

[$ (^Enter^) Loveby (^and^) Boy; (^follow'd by^) Frances
Bibbers (^Wife^) .$]

   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Nay, the Devil take thee, sweet Landlady, hold thy #
tongue:
Was't not enough thou hast scolded me from my Lodging, which,
as long as I rent it, is my Castle; but to follow me here to Mr.
(^Trices^) , where I am invited; and to discredit me before          #
strangers, for a
lowsy, Paltry summ of Money?
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] I tell you truely, Mr. (^Loveby^) , my husband   #
and I cannot
live by Love, as they say; we must have wherewithal, as they
say; and pay for what we take; and so shall you, or some shall
smoak for't.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Smoak! why a piece of hung Beef in (^Holland^) is  #
not more
smoakt, then thou hast Smoak'd me already. Thou know'st I am
now fasting; let me have but fair play; when I have lined my sides
with a good dinner, I'll ingage upon reputation to come home again,
and thou shalt scold at me all the afternoon.
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] I'll take the Law on you.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] The Law allows none to scold in their own Causes:  #
What
do'st thou think the Lawyers take our money for?
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] I hope you intend to deal by my Husband like a
Gentleman, as they say?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Then I should beat him most unmercifully, and not  #
pay him
neither.
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] Come, you think to fobb me off with your Jests   #
as you
do my Husband; but it wonn't be: yonder he comes, and
company with him; Husband, husband; why (^William^) I say!

[$ (^Enter^) Bibber, Burr, (^and^) Failer (^at the other end^) .$]

   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Speak softly, and I will satisfie thee.
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] You shall not satisfie me, Sir; pay me for what  #
you owe
me, for Chamber-rent, and Diet, and many a good thing besides,
that shall be nameless.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] What a Stygian woman's this to talk thus? hold thy #
tongue
till they be gone, or I'll Cuckold thy husband:
<P 6>
   [$ (^Fran.^) $] You Cuckold him -- would you durst Cuckold him;
I will not hold my Tongue, Sir.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Yonders my Guest; what say you Gentlemen? shall I  #
call
him to go down with us?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I must make a loose from her, there's no otherway: #
Save
ye Mr. (^Failer^) ; is your Cousin (^Trice^) stirring yet: answer me #
quickly
Sir, is you Cousin (^Trice^) yet stirring?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] I'll go and see, Sir; sure the man has a mind to  #
beat me; but
I vow to Gad I have no mind to be beaten by him: come away
(^Burr^) . (^Will^) . you'll follow us.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] I'll be with you immediately --                    #
[$ (^Exeunt^) Burr. Failer.$]
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Who was that with (^Failer^) , (^Will^) .
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] A man at Armes, that's come from (^Holland^) .
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] A man out at Armes thou mean'st, (^Will^) .
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Good I'faith.
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] I, I; you run questing up and down after your    #
Gambols,
and your Jests (^William^) ; and never mind the main chance, as they
say: pray get in you Debts, and think upon your Wife and
Children.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Think upon the Sack at (^Cary-House^) , with the   #
(^Apricot^)
flavour (^Will^) . hang a Wife; What is she, but a lawful kind of
Manslayer? every little hugg in bed, is a degree of murdering thee:  #
and
for thy Children fear u'm not: thy part of u'm shall be Taylors,
and they shall trust; and those thy Customers get for thee shall be
Gentlemen, and they shall be trusted by their Brethren; and so thy
children shall live by one another.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Did you mark that (^Frances^) ? there was wit now; #
he call'd
me Cuckold to my face, and yet for my heart I cannot be angry
with him: I perceive you love (^Frances^) , Sir; and I love her the
better for your sake; speak truly, do you not like such a pretty brown
kind of woman?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I do I'faith, (^Will^) . your fair Women have no   #
substance in u'm
they shrink Ith' wetting.
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] Well, you may be undone if you will Husband: I   #
hear
there are 2 or 3 Actions already out against him: you may be the
last, if you think good.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] 'Tis true she tel's me; I love your wit well Sir;  #
but I must
cut my coat according to my cloath.
<P 7>
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] Sir, we'll come by our own as we can; if you put #
us off
from week to week thus.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Nay, but good Landlady --
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] Will good Landlady set on the Pot, as they say;  #
or make
the Jack goe; then I'll hear you.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Now she's too much on the t'other hand: hold your  #
prating
(^Frances^) ; or I'll put you out of your Pater Nosters with a       #
sorrow to you.
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] I did but lay the Law open to him, as they say,  #
whereby
to get our money in: but if you knew how he had used me Husband.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Has he us'd you (^Frances^) ; put so much more     #
into his Bill
for Lodging.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Honest (^Will^) , and so he dy'd; I thank thee     #
little (^Bibber^) ,
being sober, and when I am drunk, I will kiss thee for't.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Thank me, and pay me my money, Sir; though I could #
not
forbear my jest, I do not intend to lose by you; if you pay me not
the sooner, I must provide you another Lodging; say I gave you
warning.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Against next quarter Landlord?
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Of an hour Sir.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] That's short warning, (^Will^) .
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] By this hand you shall up into the Garret where    #
the little
bed is; I'll let my best room to a better paymaster; you know
the Garret, Sir.
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] I, he knows it by a good Token Husband.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I sweat to think of that Garret, (^Will^) . thou   #
art not so
unconscionable to put me there: why 'tis a kind of little ease, to   #
cramp
thy rebellious Prentices in; I have seen an Usurers Iron Chest would
hold two on't: a penny Looking-glass cannot stand upright in the
Window, that and the Brush fills it: the Hat-case must be dispos'd
under the Bed, and the Comb-case will hang down from the Seeling
to the Floore. If I chance to Dine in my Chamber, I must stay
till I am empty before I can get out: and if I chance to spill the
Chamber-pot, it will over-flow it from top to bottom.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Well, for the description of the Garret, I'll bate #
you
something of the Bill.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] All, all, good (^Will^) . or to stay thy fury      #
till my Rents come
up; I will describe thy little Face.
   [$ (^Bib,^) $] No, rather describe your own little money; I am    #
sure that's
so Little, it is not visible.
<P 8>
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] You are ith'right, I have not a cross at present,  #
as I am a
sinner; and you will not believe me, I'll turn my Pockets inside
outward -- Ha! What's the meaning of this, my Pockets
heavy? Has my smal Officer put in Counters to abuse me? -- How
now, yellow Boyes, by this good light! Sirrah, Varlet, how came
I by this Gold? Ha!
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] What Gold do you mean, Sir? the Devil-a-piece you  #
had
this morning: in these last three weeks, I have almost forgot what
my Teeth were made for; last night good Mrs. (^Bibber^) here took    #
pitty
on me, and crumm'd me a Mess of Gruel, with the Children, and I
popt and popt my Spoon three or four times to my mouth, before I
could find the way to't.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] 'Tis strange, how I should come by so much Money!  #
[$ (^ (aside.^) $]
Has there been no body about my Chamber this morning,
Landlady?
   [$ (^Boy.^) $] O yes, Sir; I forgot to tell you that: this        #
Morning a strange
Fellow, as ever eyes beheld, would needs come up to you when you
were asleep; but when he came down again, he said, He had not
wak'd you.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Sure this Fellow, who e'r he was, was sent by      #
Fortune to
mistake me into so much Money. -- Well, this is not the first time
my necessities have been strangely supply'd: some (^Cadua^) or other
has a kindness for me, that's certain: [$ (^ (aside.^) $] -- Well    #
Monsieur
(^Bibber^) , from henceforward I'll keep my wit for more refin'd     #
spirits;
you shall be payd with dirt; -- there's the Money for you.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Nay, Good Sir. --
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] What's your summ? tell it out: Will the Money burn
your fingers? Sirrah, Boy, fetch my Suit with the Gold Lace at
Sleeves from Tribulation -- Gives him Gold. [$ (^Exit.^) Boy.$]
Mr. (^Taylour^) , I shall turn the better Bill-man, and knock that   #
little
Coxcomb of yours, if you do not answer me what I owe you.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Pray Sir, trouble not your self; 'tis nothing;     #
Ifeck now 'tis not.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] How, nothing Sir?
   [$ (^Franc.^) $] And't please your worship, it was seventeen      #
pounds and a
Noble, yesterday at noon, your worship knows: and then your
worship came home ill last night, and complain'd of your worships    #
head;
and I sent for three Dishes of (^Tea^) for your good worship, and    #
that
was six pence more, and please your worship's honor.
<P 9>
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Well; there's eighteen pieces, tell u'm.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] I say, (^Frances^) , do not take u'm,
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] What, Is all your pleading of necessity come to    #
this?
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Now I see he will pay, he shall not pay,           #
(^Frances^) ; go home,
and fetch him the whole bag of forty pounds, I'll lend it him, and
the Lease of the House too; he shall want for nothing.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Take the Money, or I'll leave your house.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Nay, rather than displease his Worship, take it.
[$ (^She takes it.^) $]
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] So, so; go home quietly, and Suckle my God-son,    #
(^Francis^) .
[$ (^Exit^) Frances.$]
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] If you are for the Cellar, Sir, you know the way.  #
[$ (^Exit^) Bibber.$]
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] No, my first visit shall be to my Mistriss, the    #
Lady (^Constance
Nonsuch^) : She's discreet, and how the Devil she comes to love me,
I know not; yet I am pretty confident she loves me: well, no
woman can be wiser than, you know what will give her leave to be.

[$ (^Enter Lady^) Constance, (^and Madam^) Isabella.$]
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Look, look; Is not that your Servant, (^Loveby.^) ?
   [$ (^Love.^) $] 'Tis she; there's no being seen, till I am better #
habited --
[$ (^Exit^) Loveby.$]
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Let him go, and take no notice of him: poor Rogue!
He little thinks I know his poverty.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] And less, that you supply it by an unknown hand.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] I, and falsified my Fathers Keyes to do it.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] How can you answer this to your discretion?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Who could see him want she loves?


[$ (^Enter^) Setstone.$]

   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Oh here's Mr. (^Setstone^) come, your Jeweller,    #
Madam.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Welcome (^Setstone^) , hast thou perform'd thy   #
visit
Happily, and without discovery?
   [$ (^Set.^) $] As you would wish it, Madam: I went up to his
Chamber without interruption; and there found him
Drowning his cares, and pacifying his hunger with sleep;
which advantage I took, and undiscovered by him left
The Gold divided in his Pockets.
<P 10>
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Well, this Money will furnish him I hope, that   #
we may
have his company again.
   [$ (^Set.^) $] Two hundred and fifty good pounds, Madam! Has your
Father miss'd it yet?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] No; if he had, we should have all heard on't     #
before now:
but, pray God Monsieur (^Loveby^) has no other haunts to divert him  #
now
he's ransom'd: what a kind of woman is his Landlady?
   [$ (^Sett.^) $] Well enough to serve a Taylor; or to kiss when he #
comes
home drunk, or wants money; but, far unlikely to create jealousie
in your Ladiship.

[$ (^Enter^) Servant.$]

   [$ (^Serv.^) $] Madam, Justice (^Trice^) desires your Ladiships   #
excuse, that
he has not yet perform'd the Civilities of his hour to you; he is
dispatching a little business, about which he is earnestly
employed.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] He's Master of his own occasions. [$ (^Exit^)    #
Servant.$]
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] We shall see him anon, with his face as read, as   #
if it had been
boyl'd in pump-water: but, When comes this Miror of Knighthood
that is to be presented you for your Servant?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Oh, 'tis well thought on; 'Faith thou know'st my
affections are otherwise dispos'd; he's rich, and thou want'st a     #
Fortune;
atchieve him if thou can'st; 'tis but trying, and thou hast as much
wit as any Wench in (^England^) .
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] On condition you'l take it for a Courtesie to be   #
ridd of an
Ass, I care not if I marry him: the old foole, your Father, would
be so importunate to match you with a young Foole, that partly
for quietness sake I am content to take him.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] To take him! then you make sure on't.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] As sure, as if the Sack Posset were already eaten.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] But, What means wilt thou use to get him?
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I'll bribe (^Failer^) , he's the man.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Why this Knight is his inheritance; he lives     #
upon him:
Do'st thou think he'll ever admit thee to govern him? no, he fears
thy wit too much: besides, he has already received an hundred pound
to make thee Match between Sir (^Timorous^) and me.
<P 11>
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] 'Tis all one for that; I warrant you he sells me   #
Fee-simple of
him.
   [$ (^Set.^) $] Your Father, Madam. --

[$ (^Enter^) Nonsuch.$]

   [$ (^Isab.^) $] The Tempest is risen; I see it in his face; he    #
puffs and
blowes yonder, as if two of the Winds were fighting upwards and
downwards in his belly.
   [$ (^Set.^) $] Will he not find your false Keyes, Madam?
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I hope he will have more Humanity then to search us.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] You are come after us betimes, Sir.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] Oh Child! I am undone; I am robb'd, I am robb'd; I #
have
utterly lost all stomach to my dinner.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Robb'd! good my Lord how, or of what?
   [$ (^Non.^) $] Two hundred and fifty pounds in fair Gold out of   #
my Study:
an hundred of it I was to have paid a Courtier this afternoon for a
Bribe.
   [$ (^Set.^) $] I protest, my Lord, I had as much a do to get that #
parcel of
Gold for your Lordship. --
   [$ (^Non.^) $] You must get me as much more against to morrow; for
then my Friend at Court is to pay his Mercer.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Nay, if that be all, there's no such hast: the     #
Courtiers are
not so forward to pay their Debts.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Has not the (^Monkey^) been in the Study? he may #
have
carried it away, and dropt it under the Garden-window: the grass is  #

   [$ (^Fail.^) $] This is the Gentleman, my Lord
   [$ (^Non.^) $] He's wellcome --
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] And this the particular of his Estate.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] That's wellcome too.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] But, besides the Land here mentioned, he has      #
wealth in
specie.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] A very fine young Gentleman.
<P 12>
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] Now, my Lord, I hope there's no great need of      #
Wooing:
I suppose my Estate will speak for me; yet, if you please to put in a
word.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] That will I instantly.
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] I hope I shall have your good word too Madam, to   #
your
Cousin for me; [$ (^To^) Isabelle.$]
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Any thing within my power, Sir (^Timerous^) .
   [$ (^Non.^) $] Daughter, here's a person of Quality, and one that #
loves
and honours you exceedingly --
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] Nay, good Lord! you discover all at first dash.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] Let me alone, Sir; Have not I the dominion over my 
own Daughter? (^Constance^) , here's a Knight in love with you,
Childe.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] In love with me, my Lord, it is not possible.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] Here he stands that will make it good, Childe.
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] Who I, my Lord? I hope her Ladyship has a better   #
opinion
of me than so.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] What, Are not you in love with my Daughter? I'll be
Sworn you told me so but even now: I'll eat words for no man.
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] If your Ladyship will believe all reports that are #
raised on
Men of Quality --
   [$ (^Non.^) $] He told it me with his own mouth, Child: I'll eat  #
words
for no man; that's more then ever I told him yet.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] You told him so but just now; fye, Sir            #
(^Timerous^) .
   [$ (^Non.^) $] He shall have no Daughter of mine and he were a    #
thousand
Knights; he told me, he hop'd I would speak for him: I'll eat no
mans words; that's more than ever I told him yet.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] You need not keep such a pudder about eating his   #
words; you
see he has eaten u'm already for you.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] I'll make him stand to his words, and he shall not #
marry my
Daughter neither: by this good day, I will -- [$ (^Exit^) Nonsuch.$]
   [$ (^Const.^) $] 'Tis an ill day to him; he has lost 250 (^l.^)   #

   [$ (^Burr.^) $] He swears at the rate of two thousand pounds a    #
year, if the
(^Rump^) Act were still in being.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] He's in passion man; and besides, he has been a   #
great
Fanatick formerly, and now has got a habit of Swearing, that he may be
thought a Cavalier.

   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Why?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] To guard our interest in him from the Enemy Madam
<P 15>

her wit,
but her sex; she carries a prevailing argument about her.

   [$ (^Bib.^) $] By this hand, I have a light upon the best wine in #

I am gone.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Here then, honest (^Will^) . 'tis a cup of        #
forbearance to thee.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Thank you Sir, I'll pledge you -- now here's to you
again.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Come away; what is't (^Will^) .
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] 'Tis what you christened it, a cup of forbearance  #
Sir.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Why, I drank that to thee (^Will^) . that thou    #
shouldst forbear
thy money.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] And I drink this to you, Sir; henceforward I'll    #
forbear

   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Then say I: take a little Bibber, and throw him   #
in the River,
and if he will trust never, then there let him lie ever.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] Then say I: take a little (^Failer^) , and throw   #
him to the
Jaylour; and there let him lie, till he has paid his Tailor.
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] You are very smart upon one another Gentlemen.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] This is nothing between us; I use to tell him of  #
his Title,
(^Fiery facias^) ; and his setting dog, that runs into Ale-houses    #
before
him, and comes questing out again, if any of the woots his customers
be within.
   [$ (^Bib.^) $] I faith 'tis true; and I use to tell him of his    #
two Capons tails
about his hat, that are laid spread eagle wise to make a feather; I
would go into the snow at any time, and in a quarter of an hour I    #
would
come in with a better feather upon my head; and so farewell Sir; I
have had the better on you hitherto, and for this time I am resolved
to keep it. [$ (^Exit^) Bibber.$]
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] The rogue's too hard for me; but the best on't    #
is, I have my
revenge upon his purse.

[$ (^Enter^) Isabelle.$]
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Came not Sir (^Timerous^) this way, Gentlemen? he #
left us in
the Garden, and said he would look out my Lord (^Nonsuch^) , to make
his peace with him.
<P 16>
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Madame, I like not your enquiring after Sir       #
(^Timerous^) : I
suspect you have some design upon him: you would fain undermine
your Cousin, and marry him your self.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Suppose I should design it; what are you the      #
worse for my
good fortune? Shall I make a proposition to you: I know you two
carry a great stroke with him: make the match between us, and
propound to your selves what advantages you can reasonably hope: you
shall chouse him of horses, cloathes and Money, and I'll wink at it.
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] And if he will not be chous'd, shall we beat him   #
out on't?
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] For that, as you can agree.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Give us a handsel of the bargain; let us enjoy    #
you, and 'tis
a match.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Grammarcy ifaith boyes; I love a good offer how   #
e'r the
world goes? but you would not be so base to wrong him that way.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] I vow to gad but I would Madam: in a horse or a   #
woman I
may lawfully cheat my own Father: besides, I know the Knights
complexion; he would be sure to follow other women; and all that.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Nay, if he fought with the sword, he should give  #
me leave
to fight with the Scabbard.
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] What say you Madam? is't a bargain.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] 'Tis but a promise; and I have learnt a Court     #
trick for
performing any thing [$ (aside) $] Well Gentlemen, when I am married #
I'll
think upon you; you'll grant there's a necessity I should Cuckold
him, if it were but to prove my self a Wit.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Nay, there's no doubt you'll Cuckold him; and all #
that;
for look you he's a person fit for nothing else; but I fear we shall
not have the graffing of the horns; we must have Livery and Seisin
before hand of you, or I protest to gad we believe you not.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I have past my word, is't not sufficient? what do  #
you think,
I would tell a lie to save such a paltrie thing as a nights lodging?
-- Hark you Sir: [$ (to (^Burr^) .) $]
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Now will she attempt (^Burr^) ; igad she has      #
found him out for
the weaker vessel.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I have no kindness for that (^Failer^) , we'll     #
strike him out, and
manage Sir (^Timerous^) our selves.
   [$ (^Burr:^) $] Indeed we wonnot.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] (^Failer's^) a Rook, and besides, he's such a      #
debauched fellow.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] I am ten times worse.
<P 17>
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Leave it, and him that taught it you: you have     #
virtuous
inclinations, and I would not have you ruine your self. He that serves
many Mistresses, surfeits on his diet, and grows dead to the whole
sex: 'tis the folly in the world next long ears and braying.
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] Now I'm sure you have a mind to me; when a woman   #
once
falls to preaching, the next thing is ever use and application.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Forbear your rudeness --
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] Then I am sure you meant to jilt me: you decline   #
(^Failer^)
because he has wit; and you think me such an ass, that you may pack
me off so soon as you are married; no, no, I'll not venture          #
certainties for
uncertainties.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I can hold no longer; Mr. (^Failer^) , what do you #
think this
fellow was saying of you?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Of me, Madam.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] That you were one of the errantest Cowards in      #
Christendom,
though you went for one of the Dear Hearts: that your name had
been upon more posts than play-bills: and that he had been
acquainted with you these seven years, drunk and sober, and yet could
never fasten a quarrel upon you.
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] Do you believe this, Dear Heart?
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] If you deny it, I'll take his sword, and force you #
to confess it.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] I vow to gad, this will not do, Madam: you shall  #
not set us
at variance so easily; neither shall you have Sir (^Timerous^) .
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] No! then mark my words: I'll marry him in spight   #
of you;
and which is worse, you shall both work my ends; and I'll discard
you for your pains.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] You shall not touch a bit of him: I'll preserve   #
his humbles
from you igad; they shall be his Keepers fees.
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] She shall cut an Atome sooner than divide us.
[$ (^Exeunt^) Burr (^and^) Failer.$]

   [$ (^Con.^) $] I have given u'm the slip in the Garden, to come   #

overhear thee: no fat overgrown virgin of forty ever offer'd         #
her self so dog
cheap, or was more despis'd: me-thinks now this should mortifie
thee exceedingly.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Not a whit the more for that: Cousin mine, our Sex #
is not
so easily put out of conceit with our own beauties.
<P 18>
   [$ (^Con.^) $] Thou hast lost the opinion of thy honesty, and got #
nothing
in recompence: now that's such an oversight in a Lady.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] You are deceiv'd; they think me too virtuous for  #
their
purpose; but I have yet another way to try, and you shall help me.
[$ (^Enter^) Loveby (^new habited^) .$]
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Mr. (^Loveby^) . welcome, welcome: where have    #
you been this
fortnight.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Faith Madam, out of Town to see a little thing     #
that's fallen
to me upon the death of a Grandmother.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] You thank death for the windfall, Servant: but   #
why are
you not in mourning for her.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Troth Madam it came upon me so suddenly I had not  #
time:
twas a fortune utterly unexpected by me.
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] Why, was your Grandmother so young you could not  #
look 
for her disease?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Not for that neither; but I had many other kindred #
whom
she might have left it to, only she heard I liv'd here in fashion, and
spent my money in the eye of the world.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] You forge these things prettily, but I have      #
heard you are as
poor as a decimated Cavalier, and had not one foot of land in all
the world.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Rivals tales, Rivals tales, Madam.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Where lies your land, Sir?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I'll tell you Madam, it has upon it a very fair    #
Manor house;
from one side you have in prospect an hanging Garden.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Who was hang'd there? not your Grandmother I hope?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] In the midst of it you have a Fountain: you have   #
seen that at
(^Hampton-Court^) ; it will serve to give you a slight image of it.
Beyond the Garden you look to a River through a Perspective of
fruit-trees; and beyond the River you see a Mead so flowry: well I   #
shall
never be at quiet, till we two make hay there.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] But where lies this Paradice?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Pox on't; I am thinking to sell it, it has such a  #
villanous
unpleasant name; it would have sounded so harsh in a Ladies ear.
But for the Fountain, Madam --
   [$ (^Const.^) $] The Fountain's a poor excuse, it will not hold   #
water; come
the name, the name.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Faith it is come so lately into my hands, that I   #
have forgot
the name on't.
<P 19>
   [$ (^Isab.^) $] That's much, now, you should forget the name, and #
yet
could make such an exact description of the place.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] If you will needs know, the name's (^Bawdy^) ;     #
sure this will give
a stop to their curiosity. [$ (^ (aside.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] At least you'll tell us in what County it lies,    #
that my Cousin
may send to enquire about it; come, this shall not serve your turn,
tell us any Town that's near it.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] 'Twill be somewhat too far to send; it lies in the #
very North
of (^Scotland^) .
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] In good time, a Paradice in the (^Highlands^) ;    #
is't not so Sir?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] It seems you went Post, Servant: in troth you    #
are a rank
rider, to go to the North of (^Scotland^) , stay and take            #
possession, and
return again, in ten days time.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I never knew your Grandmother was a (^Scotch^)     #
woman: is she
not a (^Tartar^) too: pray whistle for her, and lets see her daunce: #
come
-- whist Grannee!
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Fie fie Servant; what no invention in you? all   #
this while
a studying for a name of your Manor? come, come, where lyes it?
tell me.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] No faith, I am wiser than so; I'll discover my     #
Seat to no
man; so I shall some damn'd Lawyer keep a prying into my title
to defeat me of it.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] How then shall I be satisfied there is such a    #
thing in
Nature?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Tell me what Jewel you would wear, and you shall   #
have it:
Enquire into my money, there's the trial.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Since you art so flush, Sir, you shall give me a #
Locket of
Diamonds of three hundred pounds.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] That was too severe; you know he has but a 250     #
(^l.^) to bestow.
[$ (^to her.^) $]
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Well you shall have it, Madam: but I cannot        #
higgle: I
know you'll say it did not cost above 200 pieces.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I'll be hanged if he does not present you with a   #
parcel of melted
Flints set in Gold, or (^Norfolk^) pebbles.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Little Gentlewoman you are so keen: -- Madam, this #
night
I have appointed business, to morrow I'll wait upon you with it.
[$ (^Exit^) Loveby.$]
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] By that time he has bought his Locket, and paid his
<P 20>
Landlady, all his Money will be gone: but, Do you mean to prosecute
your plot, to see him this evening?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Yes, and that very privately; if my Father know  #
it I am
undone.

[$ (^Enter^) Setstone.$]

   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I heard him say this night he had appointed        #
business.
   [$ (^Set.^) $] Why that was it Madam; according to your order I   #
put on
a disguise, and found him in the (^Temple-Walkes^)                   #
[^NO ITALICS FOR Walkes IN SOURCE TEXT^] : having drawn him
aside, I told him, if he expected happiness, he must meet me in a    #
blind
Alley I nam'd to him, on the back-side of Mr. (^Trices^) house, just #
at
the close of evening; there he should be satisfied from whom he
had his suplies of Money.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] And how did he receive the Summons?
   [$ (^Set.^) $] Like a bold Hector of (^Troy^) ; without the least #
doubt or
scruple: but, the jeast on't was, he would needs believe that I was  #
the
Devil.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Sure he was afraid to come then.
   [$ (^Set.^) $] Quite contrary; he told me I need not be so shy,   #
to
acknowledge my self to him; he knew I was the Devil; but he had learnt
so much civility, as not to press his Friend to a farther            #
[^SOURCE TEXT: farrher^] discovery
than he was pleased, I should see I had to do with a Gentleman;
and any Courtesie I should confer on him he would not be
unthankful; for he hated ingratitude of all things.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] 'Twas well carried not to disabuse him: I laugh  #
to think
what sport I shall have anon, when I convince him of his lies, and
let him know I was the Devil to whom he was beholding for his
Money: go (^Setstone^) ; and in the same disguise be ready for him.
[$ ( (^Exit.^) Setstone.$]

<P 22>
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Come on Sir; What's your will with me?           #
[$ (^ (Laughs) ^) $]
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] Why Madam, I could onely wish we were a little     #
better
acquainted, that we might not laugh at one another so.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] If the Fool puts forward I am undone.
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] Fool! Do you know me Madam?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] You may see I know you, because I call you by    #
your name.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] You must endure these rebukes with patience, Sir
(^Timorous^) .
   [$ (^Const.^) $] What, are you Plannet stroke? Look you, my Lord, #
the
Gentleman is Tongue-ty'd.
   [$ (^Non.^) $] This is past enduring.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] 'Tis nothing, my Lord; Courage, Sir (^Timorous^) .
   [$ (^Non.^) $] I say 'tis past enduring; that's more then ever I  #
told you
yet: Do you come to make a fool of my Daughter?
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Why Lord --
   [$ (^Non.^) $] Why Lady -- [$ ( (^Exit^) Nonsuch.$]
   [$ (^Trice.^) $] Let's follow the old Man, and pacifie him.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Now Cousin -- [$ (^Exeunt^) Isabelle, Trice,       #
Burr.$]
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Well Mr. (^Failer^) , I did not think you of all #
the rest would
have endeavoured a thing so much against my inclination, as this
Marriage: if you had been acquainted with my heart, I am sure you
would not.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] What can the meaning of this be? you would not    #
have me
believe you love me; and yet how otherwise to understand you I
vow to gad I cannot comprehend.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] I did not say I lov'd you, but if I should take  #
a fancy to your
Person and Humour: I hope it is no Crime to tell it you: Women
are ty'd to hard unequal Laws: the passion is the same in us, and yet
we are debarr'd the freedom to express it. You make poor (^Grecian^)
beggars of us Ladies; our desires must have no language; but onely
be fastned to our breasts.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Come, come; I gad I know the whole Sex of you:    #
your
Love's at best but a kind of blind-mans-buff, catching at him that's
next in your way.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Well Sir, I can take nothing ill from you; when  #
'tis too
late you'l see how unjust you have been to me. -- I have said too
much already. -- [$ (^ (is going.) ^) $]
<P 23>
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Nay, stay sweet Madam: I vow to gad my fortunes   #
better
than I could imagine.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] No, pray let me go, Sir; perhaps I was in jeast.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Really Madam, I look upon you as a person of such #
worth
and all that, that I Vow to gad I honour you of all persons in the
World; and though I am a person that am inconsiderable in the
World, and all that Madam, yet for a person of your worth and
excellency, I would --
   [$ (^Const.^) $] What would you, Sir?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Sacrifice my life and fortunes, I vow to gad,     #
Madam.

[$ (^Enter^) Isabelle, Burr, (^and^) Timorous (^at a distance
from them^) .$]

   [$ (^Isa.^) $] There's (^Failer^) close in Talk with my Cousin;   #
he's solliciting
your suit, I warrant you, Sir (^Timorous^) : do but observe with what
passion he courts for you.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] I do not like that kneading of her hand though.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Come, you are such a jealous Coxcomb: I warrant you
suspect there's some amour between u'm; there can be nothing in't it #
is
so open: pray observe.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] But, How come you so officious, Madam; you, that  #
e'r
now had a design upon Sir (^Timorous^) for your self                 #
[^SOURCE TEXT: you self^] ?
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I thought you had a better opinion of my Wit, than #
to
think I was in earnest. My Cousen may do what she pleases, but he
shall never pin himself upon me assure him.
   [$ (^Const.^) to (^Fail^) .$] Sir (^Timorous^) little knows how   #
dangerous a person he has
employed in making love: -- [$ (^ (aloud) ^) $]
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] How's this! Pray my Lady (^Constance^) , what's   #
the
meaning of that you say to (^Failer^) ?
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] What luck was this, that he should over-hear you! #
pax
on't!
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Mr. (^Burr^) , I owe you not that satisfaction;  #
what you have
heard you may interpret as you please.
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] The Rascal has betray'd me.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] In earnest, Sir, I do not like it.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Dear Mr. (^Burr^) . be pacify'd; you are a person #
I have an
<P 24>
honour for; and this change of Affairs shall not be the worse for you
I gad Sir.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Bear up resolutely Mr. (^Failer^) ; and maintain #
my Favours,
as becomes my servant.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] He maintain u'm! go you (^Judas^) ! I'll teach    #
you what 'tis
to play fast and loose with a Man of War [$ ( (^Kickes him.^) $]
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] Lay it on (^Burr^) .
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Spare him not, (^Burr^) .
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Fear him not, (^Servant^) .
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Oh, oh; would no body were on my side; here I am  #
prais'd
I vow to gad into all the Colours of the Rainbow.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] But, remember 'tis for me.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] As you like this, proceed, Sir; but, come not     #
near me to
night, while I'm in wrath. [$ ( (^Exeunt^) Burr (^and^) Timorous.$]
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Come, Sir; How fare you after your sore Trial:   #
you bore
it with a most heroick patience.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Brave man at Armes, but weak to (^Balthazer^) !
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] I hope to gad, Madam, you'l consider the merit of #
my
sufferings: I would not have been beaten thus, but to obey that
person in the World --
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Heaven reward you for't: I never shall.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] How Madam!
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Art thou such an Ass as not to perceive thou art   #
abused:
this beating I contriv'd for you: you know upon what acount; and
have yet another or two at your service: yield up the Knight in
time, 'tis your best course.
   [$ (^Fail^) $] Then, Does not your Ladyship Love me Madam?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Yes, yes; I love to see you beaten.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Well, methinks now you have had a hard bargain     #
on't: you
have lost your Cully, Sir (^Timorous^) ; and your Friend (^Burr^) ,  #
and all
to get a poor beating: but I'll see it mended against next time for
you. [$ ( (^Exeunt^) Constance, Isabelle (^Laughing^) .$]
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] I am so much amaz'd, I vow to gad, I do not       #
understand my
own condition. [$ ( (^Exit^) Failer.$]

[$ (^Enter^) Failer (^at t'other end of the Stage^) .$]

   [$ (^Fail.^) $] What will become of me to night! I am just in the
condition of an out-lying-Deere, that's beaten from his walk for     #
offering
to rutt: Enter I dare not for (^Burr^) .
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I hear a voice, but nothing do I see; speak what   #
thou
art.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] There he is, watching for me: I must venture to   #
run by him,
and when I am in, I hope my Cousin (^Trice^) will defend me: the
Devil would not lie abroad in such a night.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I thought it was the Devil before he nam'd himself.
[$Failer (^goes to run off, and falls into^) Loveby's (^armes^) .$]
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Honest Sathan! well encounter'd! I am sorry with   #
all my

Lodging; prithee let's not be such strangers to one another for the
time to come; and, What hast thou got under thy Cloak there
little Sathan; I warrant thou hast brought me some more Money.
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Help; help; Thieves, thieves.
[$Loveby (^lets him go^) .$]
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] This is (^Failers^) voice: How the Devil was I     #
mistaken! I
must get off, e'r Company comes in. [$ ( (^Exit^) Loveby.$]
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] Thieves! Thieves!

[$ (^Enter^) Trice, Burr, Timorous, (^undress'd^) .$]

   [$ (^All:^) $] Where! where!
   [$ (^Fail.^) $] One was here just now; and it should be           #
(^Loveby^) by his
voice, but I have no Witness.
   [$ (^Trice.^) $] It cannot be; he wants no Money.
   [$ (^Burr.^) $] Come, Sirrah; I'll take pity on you to night; you #
shall lie
in the Truckle-bed.

[$Constance, Isabelle.$]

   [$ (^Const.^) $] 'Twas ill luck to have the meeting broke last    #
night,
just as (^Setstone^) was coming towards him.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] But in part of recompence you'll have the
pleasure of putting him on farther streights, O,
these little mischiefs are meat and drink to me.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] He shall tell me from whence he has his Money:   #
I am
resolv'd now to try him to the utmost.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] I would devise something for him to do, which he   #
could not
possibly perform.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] As I live yonder he comes with the Jewel in his  #
hand he
promis'd me; prithee leave me alone with him.
   [$ (^Isa.^) $] Speed the Plough; if I can make no sport I'll      #
hinder none:
I'll to my Knight, Sir (^Timirous^) ; shortly you shall hear newes   #
from
(^Damaetas^) . [$ (^Exit^) Isabelle.$]

[$ (^Enter^) Loveby.$]

   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Look you Madam, here's the Jewel; do me the favor to
accept it, and suppose a very good Complement deliver'd with it.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Believe me a very fair Jewel: but, Why will you  #
be at this
needless charge? What acknowledgment do you expect? you know
I will not Marry you.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] How the Devil do I know that; I don not conceive   #
my self
under correction, so inconsiderable a person.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] You'll alter your partial opinion, when I tell   #
you 'tis not
a flash of wit fires me; nor is it a gay out-side can seduce me to
Matrimony.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I am neither Fool, nor deform'd so much as to be
despicable. What do I want?
<P 28>
   [$ (^Const.^) $] A good Estate, that makes every thing handsome;  #
nothing
can look well without it.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Does this Jewel express poverty?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] I conjure you by your love to me, tell me one    #
truth not
minc'd by your invention: How came you by this Jewel.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] 'Tis well I have a Voucher; pray ask your own      #
Jeweller
(^Setstone^) , if I did not buy it of him.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] How glad you are now, you can tell a truth so    #
near a lie:
but, Where had you the Money that purchas'd it? come, -- 
without circumstances and preambles --
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Umh, -- perhaps that may be a secret.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Say it be one; yet he that lov'd indeed, could   #
not keep
it from his Mistriss.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Why should you be thus importunate?
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Because I cannot think you love me, if you will  #
not trust
that to my knowledge, which you conceal from all the World
beside.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] You urge me deeply --
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Come, sweet Servant, you shall tell me; I am     #
resolv'd to
take no denial: Why do you sigh?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] If I be blasted it must out.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Either tell me, or resolve to take your leave    #
forever.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Then know I have my means; I know not how.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] This is a fine secret.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Why then if you will needs know; 'tis from the     #
Devil; I
have Money from him, what, and when I please.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Have you seal'd a Covenant, and given away your  #
Soul for
Money?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] No such thing intended on my part.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] How then?
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I know not yet what conditions he'll propose: I    #
should
have spoke with him last night, but that a cross chance hinder'd
it.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] Well, my opinion is, some great Lady that is in  #
love with
you, supplies you still; and you tell me an incredible Tale of the
Devil, meerly to shadow your infidelity.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Devise some meanes to try me.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] I take you at your word; you shall swear freely  #
to bestow
<P 29>
on me, what ever you shall gain this unknown-way; and for a proofe,
because you tell me you can have Money, what and when you please;
bring me an hundred pounds e'r night: (If I do marry him for a
Wit) I'll see what he can do; he shall have none from me.            #
[$ (^ (aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] You overjoy me, Madam; you shall have it, and 'twere
twice as much.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] How's this!
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] The Devil a cross that I have; or know where to    #
get; but
I must promise well to save my credit: now Devil, if thou do'st
forsake me! [$ (^ (aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Const.^) $] I mistrust you; and therefore if you faile, I'll #
have your
hand to show against you; here's inke and paper
[$Loveby (^Writes^) ,$]

[$ (^Enter^) Burr (^and^) Timorous.$]

   [$ (^Bur.^) $] What makes (^Loveby^) yonder? he's Writing somewhat.
   [$ (^Tim.^) $] I'll go see. -- [$ (^ (Lookes over him.) ^) $]
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] Have you no more manners then to overlook a man when
he's a Writing? -- Oh, Is't you Sir (^Timorous^) ? you may stand     #
still;
now I think on't you can not read Written hand.
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] You are very familiar with Sir (^Timorous^) .
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] So I am with his Companions Sir.
   [$ (^Bur.^) $] Then there's hopes you and I may be better         #
acquainted: I
am one of his Companions.
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] By what title, as you are an Ass Sir.
   [$ (^Const.^) $] No more Loveby. --
   [$ (^Lov.^) $] I need not Madam; alass this fellow is onely the   #
Sollicitor
of a quarrel, till he has brought it to an head; and I will leave the
fighting part to the Curteous pledger. Do not I know these fellows?  #
you
shall as soon perswade a Mastiff to fasten on a Lyon, as one of      #
these to
ingage with a courage above their own: they know well enough who 
they can beat, and who can beat them.
