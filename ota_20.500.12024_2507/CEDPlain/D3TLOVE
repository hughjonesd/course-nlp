[$ (^Major Adams is called into the Court, and sworn.^) $]
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Declare your knowledge in this businesse?       #
[$ (^M. Adams.^) $] Touching Alderman (^Bunce^) 
and (^Mason^) , I know something by relation touching the            #
correspondency with them.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Tell the manner of it. 
   [$ (^M. Adams.^) $] I conceive it was carried on by (^Mr.         #
Drake^) , that 
is now absent; and in (^Scotland^) , by one (^Baily^) .
<P 34>
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVhat do you know of (^Mason^) , and of       #
letters sent by him? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] (^Mason^) I do 
know, and I do know he did receive letters.
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] From whom? [$ (^M. Adams.^) $] He said, from   #
my Lord (^Piercy^) .
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] To whom were those letters communicated here? #
[$ (^M. Adams.^) $] They were 
communicated to (^M. Drake^) , and by (^M. Drake^) , to my selfe,    #
and (^M. Alford^) , and (^C. Potter^) , and (^C. Far^) .
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVas (^M. Love^) privie to it?                #
[$ (^M. Adams.^) $] I cannot say that, my Lord.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVere there not letters sent to (^Scotland^)  #
to them, and back again hither, about sending 
moderate propositions to the King? [$ (^M. Adams.^) $] There was     #
such letters.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] VVho writ them? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] That I     #
cannot tell. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Had (^Mr. Love^) a hand in 
them? [$ (^M. Adams.^) $] I cannot say he had. I cannot prove a      #
negative, I cannot say he had not.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] What know you of the petition sent to the     #
King? [$ (^M. Adams.^) $] I know nothing of it, 
only I was told of it. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Who told you of it?         #
[$ (^M. Adams.^) $] I cannot my Lord fix it upon 
any particular man, but I believe I was told of it by (^Alford^) ,   #
or (^Far^) , or (^Bains^) ; for I was not there at 
that time. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] What do you know about the meeting at   #
the (^Swan^) at (^Dowgate^) ?
   [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] My Lord I was not there. [$ (^At. Gen.^) $]  #
Then my Lord, he may tell you what he doth know?
   [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] My Lord, upon our meeting in some place or   #
other, I cannot tell where, I cannot tell 
the time, nor the place, but either at the (^Swan^) in               #
(^Fish-street^) , or at the (^Swan^) at (^Dowgate^) , or in 
(^Cat-eaten street^) ; in one of these three places, I cannot        #
punctually remember.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Who was at that meeting? [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $]  #
Mr. (^William Drake^) , Captain (^Titus^) , Major 
(^Alford^) , Captain (^Far^) , Captain (^Potter^) , and my selfe;    #
and I do not know how many more, or whether 
any more, or no. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] What past there?                  #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] It was there agreed, that Captain (^Titus^) 
should go over to (^Jersy^) . [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] What was he        #
imployed about? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] The end of his 
going, was to endeavour to work an agreement between the King and    #
(^Scots^) , according to the Covenant. 
That was the end that was propounded. And in order to his going, wee #
did agree to furnish 
him with money for the present, and made some kind of promise to     #
maintaine him while he was 
out. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] What money was he furnished with?           #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] I cannot be punctuall in that, but 
about a hundred pounds. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Who should pay it?       #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] I paid twenty pounds of 
it, but I cannot tell who paid the rest. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] To whom #
did you pay it? [$ (^Adams.^) $] To (^Mr. Drake^) .
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, Ask him whether when this was sent   #
to (^Jersy^) , was there not a return made?
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Well, go on, There was your twenty pounds      #
gone? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] This is the substance 
of what I can say of his going. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was this twenty  #
pounds that you laid out of your owne, 
or did you collect it of some of the rest, or did you gather any of  #
it again? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] I cannot 
say that I did. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Did you not? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $]  #
My Lord, I tell you the truth, I doe not know 
whether I did, or no: for I remember it was determined that we       #
should gather it at that meeting?
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Did not (^Mr. Love^) know of the collection?   #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] I cannot say he did, it may be, 
he might, but I dare not say upon my oath, that he knew of it.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Ask him what return (^Titus^) made, what      #
answer, and what account he gave?
   [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] (^M. Alford^) went to (^Calice^) to meet     #
(^Titus^) , and (^Titus^) did send word that the Councell of
State heard of his being there, and thereupon desired that some body #
might be sent over to him; for 
he had something to communicate which he could not well do by        #
writing, and thereupon (^Mr. Alford^) 
was sent. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, Ask him where the letter was  #
read? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] The letter that 
(^Titus^) sent, was read by Mr. (^William Drake^) .                  #
[$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Where? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] At his house, as I 
think, for I cannot certainly remember, I did not say, upon my       #
Examination that it was read any where.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Whether were not you moved to go?             #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] There was some motion to that end.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] VVho moved it, and where? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $]  #
VVho moved it, I cannot tell; it was moved, 
I think, in (^Mr. Loves^) Chamber. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was           #
(^Mr. Love^) there? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] He was there.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did (^Mr. Love^) move it?                     #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] I cannot say he did.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] He will not say it? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] I      #
cannot say it upon my oath.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, so much he saith, that it was moved  #
in (^Mr. Loves^) chamber, then he may give 
you an account of (^Mr. Alfords^) return, and where the account was  #
given? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] The returne 
of (^Mr. Alfords^) account was given at (^Mr. Loves^) house.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] VVhat was it? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] The return   #
he made in generall was by a 
Narrative, and 
a copie of a letter from the King: there was with the Narrative that #
which was said to be the copie
of a letter from the King. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] What was the substance  #
of that letter? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] The
<P 35>
contents of the letter, as I remember, was first, he exprest a great #
deal of affection to the Ministry of 
(^England^) in generall, and promised great favour when he was in a  #
condition to do it, and desired them to 
continue stedfast in the way they were in. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was   #
this letter published at (^Mr. Loves^) 
study?
   [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] It was read. [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Was          #
(^Mr. Love^) there? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] Truly, to be positive, that 
(^Mr. Love^) was there, I dare not say; but (^Mr. Love^) was there   #
at that meeting, either at the beginning or 
ending, but whether the letter was read at Mr. (^Loves^) house, I    #
dare not swear; the Narrative from (^Titus^) , 
was a very long one, and very well drawn, I cannot give an account   #
of it now: the whole of it was 
after this manner; To give an account to us of all the transactions  #
that had happened since his going 
out of (^England^) , he did give an account of his usage by the      #
Cavalier Party, that was against the Kings 
agreement with the (^Scots^) , because there was some did incline to #
his agreement with them, and there 
was another party was much against it, and he gave a very large      #
account of that: after that he went on 
describing his disposition and condition.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] This was the substance of the rest. Was there #
not some propositions for giving of thanks 
to (^Titus^) , for his so wel managing his affairs there?            #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] There was a motion made by some body.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Who made the motion? [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] I      #
cannot tell.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was not an hundred pounds more to be sent     #
agreed upon there? [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] I think so.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] There was more money contributed; who agreed  #
to lend any? [$ (^Adams?^) $] Sir, To 
that question, I cannot say, who propounded it; but that there was   #
money sent.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Who contributed? [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] I did my   #
share.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] How much was that? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] As I    #
remember, ten pounds.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] To whom did you pay it, and where did you pay #
it?
[$ (^Then they shewed him his Examination.^) $]
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Come, look upon it, and be well advised.        #
[$ (^Adams looks upon his Examination.^) $]
   [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] I paid it to Mr. (^Drake^) at his fathers     #
shop in Cheap-side.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Next about the Commission and instructions to #
be sent, what do you know of that?
when this letter was read from the King, and published in Mr.        #
(^Loves^) study, whether was there not a 
Commission agreed upon, to give instructions to treat with the King  #
at (^Bredah^) ?
   [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] There was a motion made at Mr. (^Loves^)      #
house, that there should be a commission and 
instructions drawn and sent; the motion was made at (^Mr. Loves^)    #
house, they were there spoken of.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] By whom, who did the Dialogue run between? Did  #
(^Mr. Love^) do it?
   [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] Truely, for my part, I did not then take such #
speciall notice, that I dare at this time 
upon my oath, deliver any thing positively against any particular    #
man, but generally all spake 
something, as I remember. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there any debate   #
to mend the instructions? [$ (^Adams.^) $] Truly, 
Sir, not as I remember. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did not (^Mr. Gibbons^)  #
bring the rough draft of the Commission?
   [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] Truely, I think he did, as I remember he did, #
I have spoken of the Comission 
and instructions that were debated then and there, and that many of  #
these persons here mentioned,
were there; but that some of them mentioned, might not be there      #
then, is very likely.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was Mr. (^Love^) there? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $]  #
That he was there some part of this time, I am very 
confident. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Was it in his study?                    #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] It was.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there a Commission agreed upon to be      #
sent? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] For the word (^agreed^) , I 
cannot tell what to say to it; Agreed, holds forth as if a vote      #
passed.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Was there not a generall consent?               #
[$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] Being upon my oath, I desire to be 
cautious, for I must be tender in speaking the truth in this case,   #
and I do not know what to make of the 
word (^agreed^) . [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Was it approved of?              #
[$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] To my understanding the thing was thus, 
that at such meetings as these, we were not absolutely formall, as   #
if we had been established by a Court 
of Justice, to act thus, and that there should be prefaces, and such #
things, or such methods observed, as 
that any man undertook to make a preface, either at the beginning,   #
or conclusion, but it was spoken to 
by many persons, and by every person spoken to, and in this sense it #
was agreed.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were there not instructions agreed upon, and  #
all this in (^M. Loves^) study? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] It was so.
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Were they not read there? [$ (^Mr. Adams.^) $] #
I think they were.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Who read them? [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] I cannot     #
tell who read them, but they were read, and I think 
Mr. (^Drake^) read them [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] What was the contents of #
the Commission? [$Mr. (^Adams.^) $] The 
contents or the substance of the Commission was to this effect.      #
[$ (^This he reads out of his Examination.^) $]
We the Presbyterians of (^England^) , do authorize you the Lord      #
(^Willughby^) of (^Parham^) , (^Edward
<P 36>
Massey^) , (^Richard Graves^) , (^Cilas Titus^) , and (^James        #
Bunce^) , to assist our Brethren, the (^Scotch^) 
Commissioners in their Treaty with the King, according to the        #
instructions annexed; I dare not swear 
it in these words, but to this purpose it was; The substance of the  #
instructions were to use all 
the arguments they could to move the King to give the (^Scotch^)     #
satisfaction, and to take the 
Covenant; such arguments were mentioned, as the then condition of    #
affaires best afforded, 
particularly how things stood in (^England^) at that time: which did #
all of them cry out for an 
agreement, and gave them full power as to all things, and what       #
should be concluded by them, should 
be confirmed by these here; but I cannot say so, but what words      #
were, were to this purpose, saving 
this conclusion, that what was concluded, should be confirmed here,  #
I do not remember that.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there not some debate by what warrant     #
they should act in this Commission 
and instructions? [$ (^Adams.^) $] There were some such words at the #
meeting.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] What did Mr. (^Love^) say? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I   #
cannot remember what (^Mr. Love^) did say, or 
whether he said any thing or nothing at that time, but that there    #
were such words said, I have said 
it, but by whom, I cannot fix it upon any particular person.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was it not debated by what warrant they       #
should derive power to themselves to send this 
Commission? [$ (^Adams.^) $] There was such language, but by whom, I #
cannot say, I thinke 
by (^William Drake^) . It was because the King had writ this letter, #
wherein he desired there 
should be such instructions; there was something spoken of the       #
secluded members, but by whom, 
I do not know; there was a Proposition whether the authority should  #
be taken from the secluded 
Members, or from some other. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did not Mr.         #
(^Love^) then say, Come, let it go on. [$ (^Ad.^) $] I dare not say  #
so.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was it not propounded at the meeting to write #
to the Queen, and to (^Jermine^) , and 
(^Piercy^) , for them to mediate with the King to agree with the     #
(^Scots^) .
[$ (^Adams's Examination was here againe read.^) $]
   [$ (^Adams.^) $] My Lord, So much of this, as I think to be true, #
I shall own.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there not a letter writ from (^Piercy^) , #
that a considerable summe of money was 
fit to be sent to the King, and what answer was given; was it not to #
be done till the King and 
(^Scots^) should agree, and then to raise the money?                 #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] That there was such a 
letter writ, I must needs acknowledge.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Where was it read? at Mr. (^Love's^) house?   #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] No certainly, I onely 
saw it in (^Mason's^) own hands, and I remember he shewed it me.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Next ask him whether there was not a letter   #
written about (^August^) last to some here, 
that (^Massey^) had back friends in (^Scotland^) , complaining he    #
could not be promoted there? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I 
did understand there was such a letter, but by what way, I do not    #
know.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Was not the letter communicated at M.          #
(^Loves^) house, and were not you present when this letter 
was read at Mr. (^Loves^) house, wherein (^Massey^) complained he    #
had back friends in (^Scotland^) ? [$ (^Ad.^) $] No 
certainly, that letter was not to my remembrance read there, I heard #
of such a letter, but saw it not.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, ask him whether he was not appointed #
to draw up some letters. [$ (^Ad.^) $] There 
were some I should have had a hand in drawing. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $]   #
Who were appointed with you. [$ (^Ad.^) $] As 
I remember, Captain (^Potter^) , Captain (^Massey^) , and Mr.        #
(^Gibbons^) . [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] But was there no meeting 
upon it, was (^M. Love^) named? [$ (^Adams.^) $] Mr. (^Love^) was    #
not named. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there not one 
(^Sterks^) a (^Scotch^) Agent here, that kept intelligence from      #
(^Scotland^) ? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I know, there was 
such a one, we took to be an Agent here. [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Did he   #
meet at your meetings? [$ (^Ad.^) $] Yes, he 
did meet sometimes. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was he at (^Mr. Loves^)      #
house at any time? [$ (^Ad.^) $] That he was.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] When the Act came forth for banishing the     #
(^Scots^) , was there not a collection for his 
charges, and were not you at (^M. Loves^) house when it was agreed   #
to? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I was not.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you contribute money? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I  #
did contribute 10 or 12s. I cannot tell which.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] What discourse upon (^Dunbar^) fight was      #
there from this person that is already spoken of?
   [$ (^Adams.^) $] This is the thing, if you please to help my      #
memory; for there were so many particulars in this 
correspondency, that I cannot tell whereabouts it is I am to speak   #
to, I am very uncertain where 
abouts it is I am [^SOURCE TEXT: a I m^] to speak to.                #
[$L. (^Pres.^) $] Speak the certainty as it was in your breast.      #
[$ (^Ad.^) $] My Lord, if 
it be doubtfull to me, how can I be certaine, and charge it upon my  #
memory? [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Speak the 
truth? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I will speak the truth. [$ (^L. Pres.^) $]   #
Do so then? [$ (^Here again Adams looks upon his
Examinations.^) $] [$ (^Adams.^) $] There is some of it I did set    #
down, that I dare not own upon my oath, I 
then did deliver it so when I set it down.
<P 37>
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did Mr. (^Love^) know that this (^Scotch^)    #
man was the (^Scotch^) Agent? did you not take 
notice that Mr. (^Love^) took notice of him? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I do   #
think he did, as farre as I understand, he did.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did not Mr. (^Love^) generally tell you the   #
cause of the meetings? [$ (^Adams.^) $] No Sir.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you not hear Mr. (^Love^) say, that this  #
(^Sterks^) was the (^Scotch^) Agent? [$ (^Adam.^) $] I 
never heard Mr. (^Love^) say so, but I knew this, that by our usuall #
meetings Mr. (^Love^) did understand 
him as I did, to be the (^Scotch^) Agent.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] How often did you meet at Mr. (^Loves^)       #
house? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I cannot tell, it may be 
seven, or eight, or ten times; an uncertain time.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] He was at Mr. (^Loves^) study?                 #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] Whether so many times, I know not.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, ask him whether it was not at Mr.    #
(^Loves^) study when mony was 
propounded to be raised for (^Massey^) , and (^Titus^) .             #
[$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Was that in Mr. (^Loves^) study? [$ (^Ad.^) $] I  #
cannot tell 
whether it was in his study, or in the lower room, I am apt to       #
believe it was in the lower room.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was Mr. (^Love^) there? [$ (^Adams.^) $]      #
Certainly, he was there.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] What was the contents of the letter?            #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] The contents of the letter I cannot 
remember. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Whether did it not declare the poverty #
of his condition? And was it not 
after (^Dunbar^) fight? [$ (^Adams.^) $] Yes, it was.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was this letter from (^Massey^) , read at     #
Master (^Loves^) house, was this for money? [$ (^Ad.^) $] It was.
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Was it agreed for money to bee raised?         #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] If you take the word 
(^agreed^) , as I formerly propounded, it was so. 
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] How was the money to be raised, and in what   #
manner? [$ (^Adams.^) $] It was by 
those that were privy to the contribution.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was not Mr. (^Love^) there, and did not he    #
write down the sums that were to be 
contributed? [$ (^Adams.^) $] This I must needs say, that Master     #
(^Love^) had papers in his hand, and hee did 
write something, but I did not see what he did write, and every man  #
did write that was there.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did not you conceive so, that Mr. (^Love^)    #
summed up every mans sum? did he put the 
letter of their names before them, when he writ the sums?            #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] I cannot say that.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was not there a letter penn'd by Master       #
(^Love^) , and Doctor (^Drake^) ? [$ (^Ad.^) $] To that 
question, I must say there was a letter, but I cannot deliver it     #
upon my oath that it was penn'd by Master 
(^Love^) , or Doctor (^Drake^) , but it was taken to be so, and I    #
thought it was so.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] To whom was that letter directed?             #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] I cannot tell to whom.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] To whom was it declared to be directed? to    #
whom was it declared to be written?
   [$ (^Adams.^) $] To the Generall Assembly and Kirk of             #
(^Scotland^) .
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Was this at Mr. (^Loves^) house too?            #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] It was so.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was (^Mr. Love^) present, and did approve of  #
it? [$ (^Adams.^) $] Mr. (^Love^) was present at 
some time of this meeting: the reason why I thought it to be of      #
Master (^Loves^) , or Doctor (^Drakes^) 
drawing, was nothing but meerly the language of it, it being in      #
order to promote the ends of the 
Covenant, and all the whole language was couched to that purpose,    #
and taking notice of the want 
of respect to (^Massey^) , and the (^English^) , and of their being  #
beaten.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, This is very high; for he tels you   #
this letter was approved of, and directed to 
be sent, and this was after (^Dunbar^) fight, after we were ingaged  #
in bloud.
[$ (^Here Adams read out of his Examination, as followeth^) :$]      #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] There was also 
a large letter in the nature of a Declaration penn'd by Master       #
(^Love^) , and Doctor (^Drake^) , and 
approved of by most of the Presbyterian party, Ministers, and        #
other, and directed to the Generall 
Assembly, and Kirk of (^Scotland^) , subscribed by none, which       #
contained the substance of what was declared by 
(^Titus^) , and (^Massey^) , but durst not promise any great sums of #
money till they appeared more 
considerable, and grew nearer action; the businesse required higher  #
spirits then was for the present, and 
the businesse required a considerable summe: but to leave no means   #
un-attempted when the businesse 
was feasable. [$ (^So far he reads.^) $]
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Major (^Adams^) is now upon his oath to tell  #
you. [$ (^Adams.^) $] My Lord, As well as I 
remember, it did put forth much after this sort, but I cannot swear  #
it in these words, but that is the substance of it.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was not this agreed and declared at           #
(^Mr. Loves^) house, that such a letter should be written to 
the Honourable Committee, and to the Kirk. [$ (^Ad.^) $] I answer,   #
that after the same manner as all other 
things are agreed at such meetings as this is, but I have no ground, #
and do not know why I should 
say Master (^Love^) and Doctor (^Drake^) penn'd it.
<P 38>
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Ask him for the substance of the letter,      #
whether it were not as he hath told you, and 
whether he did not say, they could not promise a considerable sum of #
money. [$ (^Adams.^) $] Certainly, 
either in that letter, or some other, there was some such expressions.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] VVell, it was about that time, and in that      # 
letter, or in some other letter, and at M. (^Loves^) 
house. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, Ask him if there was not an      #
Agent come from (^Scotland^) , and a way laid 
at (^Kendall^) for a correspondency between these Gentlemen here,    #
and some of (^Scotland^) , and whether 
one (^Groves^) was not sent thither? [$ (^Adams.^) $] That was       #
something obscure; that there was such a thing, 
I do verily believe, because it went amongst us for a truth, but how #
to make it out for a truth upon my 
oath, I cannot tell. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Did (^Mr. Love^) know of it?  #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] I do not know.
   [$ (^Att Gen.^) $] Ask him what he knows concerning Colonel       #
(^Bamfield's^) man coming hither?
   [$ (^Adams.^) $] Concerning that I know nothing, but I confesse I #
had some (^Item^) , that at that time there 
was something found; and this is all I can say to that, I cannot     #
guesse the time.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was it after the fight at (^Dunbar^) ?        #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] Yes, that it was.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were the meetings at (^Mr. Loves^) house?     #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] I cannot say all, but all that I know of, were.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Ask whether upon the large letter, (^Massey^) #
did not write that things were well setled in 
(^Scotland^) ? [$ (^Adams.^) $] Many of these things were understood #
so, and taken for granted amongst us, but I 
can say no otherwise, I thought it to be so; but I know not.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were you not present, or at (^Mr. Loves^)     #
house, when these letters were read, that they were 
in a hopefull condition? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I cannot say so.           #
[$ (^L. Pres.^) $] What can you say? [$ (^Adams.^) $] As before, 
That it went for a truth amongst us, and that is as much as I can    #
say to it.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there not a large letter inviting your    #
friends to union? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I 
understand the other letter to be this you propound to me now.       #
[$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Now we speak of a letter 
from Alderman (^Bunce^) , and others? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I cannot      #
speak particularly to that; for I did not see 
them, but they were told me by one or other of those that were of    #
the correspondency, and this is all I 
can say. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] What is the truth? Doe you conceive it is #
so?
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, we shall not trouble him with that,  #
my Lord. Ask him one question more, 
What did (^Mr. Love^) tell you, that if the Presbyterians got the    #
upper hand again? [$ (^Adams.^) $] Those 
words, I think, did but amount to this, that if the Presbyterians    #
were in armes again, by the blessing 
of God, the Cavaliering party might be prevented from getting the day.
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Who do you mean by the Correspondents?         #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] By correspondents I mean (^Alford^) ,
(^Potter^) , (^Far^) , &c. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Was not Mr. (^Love^)    #
one of them? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I took him to be so, my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Love.^) $] My Lord, I pray ask him, whether any of these  #
pretended or supposed letters, were ever 
received by me, any one of them, or that I writ one of them, or      #
mended one of them. [$ (^Adams.^) $] I 
cannot say that ever I saw him do any such thing, nor did I ever see #
him write any.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] But you saw the letters there? [$ (^Adams.^) $] #
That I have said.
   [$ (^Mr. Love.^) $] Ask him whether I gave my consent to the      #
sending away of this he calls a commission, 
and instructions, about the time of the Treaty at (^Bredah^) .       #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] No, I will not swear that, 
and upon my oath I cannot. [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Will you not, I will    #
presse you to nothing, you said even 
now, you did not know he did send them away, but you did say, he was #
privy to them, and to the 
debates of them: did he declare any dissent? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I      #
cannot say that.
   [$M. (^Love.^) $] Will you ask him this question? Whether he read #
the letters that he pretends were sent
into (^England^) , or (^Scotland^) , or whether he heard them read?
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] That he swears? [$ (^Adams.^) $] I did not      #
swear that these were the contents of them exactly. 
I was there when these letters were read.
   [$ (^Mr. Love.^) $] He onely heard them read. [$L. (^Pres.^) $]   #
If there were halfe a score that had 
correspondency, and received letters, and come together, and one of  #
the most confiding men read them, will any 
man say, that he will not believe these were right read, such a      #
hear-say as this, is such a hear-say as 
you may take notice of. [$ (^M. Love.^) $] But let him prove how it  #
was a correspondency on my part.
   [$ (^Adams.^) $] I did not say that (^Mr. Love^) was one of the   #
Correspondents, I deny that I said so, I said 
I conceived him to be so, but that is not, that he was so.
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] They did debate together, and met together,    #
and received instructions, and therefore he 
may very aptly conceive he was a Correspondent?
   [$Mr. (^Love.^) $] Doth he swear that J assented?                 #
[$ (^Adams.^) $] J did not swear so?
   [$ (^Mr. Love.^) $] He saith, money was sent to (^Titus^) , pray  #
ask him whether by Agents J imployed?

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 40>
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Declare now what you know of this businesse.
   [$Mr. (^Jaquel.^) $] My Lord, for the paper I was examined about, #
as for knowing (^Titus^) , I never saw him 
in my life but one quarter of an hour in a private house, and I knew #
nothing of his businesse any where. 
For the other, (^Alford^) coming over with letters, I was at Mr.     #
(^Loves^) house, and when I was there, there 
was severall men there.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] In what part of Mr. (^Loves^) house?          #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I conceive in his chamber, for I went up to 
severall that were there, whose names I can positively say, for two  #
or three of them, though I cannot 
remember the other absolutely, though I conceive most I have named   #
in my examination were there; 
(^C. Potter^) was there, and Doctor (^Drake^) , and M. (^Alford^) ,  #
and M. (^Love^) was there somtimes, though 
divers times he went out, some coming to speak with him.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there not a copy of a letter said to be   #
sent from the King, read there? [$Mr. (^Jaquel.^) $] 
I remember no such thing.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there not a narrative. [$ (^Jaquel.^) $]  #
Yes, from (^Titus^) , wherein he declared the Kings 
inclinations to make peace with the (^Scots^) ; but that his wicked  #
counsell about him did hinder it.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was not this of what (^Titus^) had related    #
from (^Jersey^) , the narrative of what had past between 
him and the King there? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I think it was.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was not M. (^Alford^) sent to receive an      #
account from him to (^Calice^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] (^William Drake^) 
did tell me so afterwards. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did M. (^Alford^)     #
deliver no account there? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I 
think it was M. (^Alford^) read the narrative.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Did he make no relation by word of mouth?      #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Truly, I cannot remember.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] You cannot remember it was read?               #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes, I am sure it was read, and at Mr. (^Loves^) 
house. [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] And he was present sometimes?              #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes, sometimes.
   [$ (^Att Gen.^) $] What mony was there agreed upon to be          #
provided for (^Titus^) ?
   [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I know of none. It was moved by Captain         #
(^Potter^) that there might be forty pounds, but 
I know of none, nor was it agreed by M. (^Love^) , M. (^Drake^) or   #
my self, that we should lay down any at all.
<P 41>
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you not meet with (^William Drake^) , and #
desire to go along with him to see 
(^Titus^) ? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I did so, but I think (^Drake^)        #
desired it. I met him in (^Newgate^) market, and, 
saith he, I am going to see (^Titus^) , goe along with me; I said, I #
never saw him, nor did I know 
him: sayes he, You shall not stay at all: whereupon he went and      #
found him in a Cheese-mongers 
house in (^New-gate^) market.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What discourse had you? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] He   #
said, he was newly come out of (^Holland^) , and he had 
been with the King, and he was a man of excellent parts for his      #
years, and that he was inclinable to 
what was good, but that he had such desperate evill Counsell about   #
him; and that hee did much pity 
him, and that his Clergie especially was wicked; and he propounded   #
nothing to us, nor did I ever 
see his face afterwards, and this is about two years and a halfe     #
ago; and for any other 
meetings at the Swan Taverne, or for any Agents, I never met him, or #
saw him.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Doe you not remember at any meeting, that     #
there was money propounded for 
Captaine (^Titus^) , or for (^Alfords^) being sent over to           #
(^Calice^) ? Speak what you know of that, and by 
whom it was told you? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] Major (^Alford^) himselfe    #
told me he was to meet his son, and 
he went over upon that score; but after he was gone, (^William       #
Drake^) told me he was gone to see or 
meet Captaine (^Titus^) , I am not certaine of the words; and when   #
he did come againe, which was 
the next time I heard of him, then (^William Drake^) comes to me,    #
and desired mee to goe 
along with him, for I think he went up and down to every man.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] You thinke then that (^William Drake^) was    #
the prime man. [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] Yes, hee was 
the Actor and the Agent that moved all.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] When (^Alford^) returned, he desired you to   #
go with him. [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] To Mr. (^Loves^) house.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVhat was done at (^Mr. Loves house^) ?       #
[$ (^Iaquel.^) $] There were some papers read, which 
(^Alford^) , as I take it, read, or (^William Drake^) , I am not     #
certaine which; but read it was, of a 
relation, that (^Titus^) came out of (^Iersy^) , and had seen the    #
King there, and the (^Scots^) Commissioners, 
and that the King had a great inclination to agree with the          #
(^Scots^) Commissioners, and that he was 
a man of excellent inclinations and parts, and had a great desire to #
agree, but his Counsell, and 
wicked crew about him would not let him; and he said, as I remember, #
that the King was a kind 
of a Prisoner with them there, and said, his Counsell did hinder     #
him, or else, if he were from 
them, hee would agree with the (^Scots^) Commissioners.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] You say, this paper was read; this Narrative   #
was read, and in Mr. (^Loves^) house; was not Mr. 
(^Love^) present? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I am not able to say hee was,    #
when I came in, I remember he was not in 
the roome, and he was there two or three times while I was there,    #
but he was severall times called out.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Doe not you know there was an agreement of a  #
letter written back to (^Titus^) ?
   [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I can remember no such thing, but I think       #
(^William Drake^) told me so, as I remember, 
but that was two years ago, I do verily believe by what I conceived, #
was of his writing.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] I could wish that mens consciences could not    #
bee scrupled to believe so much of a 
Minister, more then of a Magistrate; I hold it pernicious doctrine   #
for any man to think he is bound 
more to obey the Minister, then the Magistrate: I ask you then       #
before the Magistrate here, who
was present at that meeting? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] (^William Drake.^) I  #
am sure, and Major (^Alford^) was there, 
and Captain (^Potter^) , and severall others, as I remember, Master  #
(^Ienkyns^) .  
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] This was in (^Mr. Loves^) house, was it not   #
in his study? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I cannot tell that, 
I say, as I conceive, that Master (^Ienkyns^) , and Master (^Case^)  #
were there, but positively I cannot say 
it, and (^Mr. Iackson^) , and (^Mr. Nalton^) , I think.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVhat say you of Mr. (^Watson^) ?             #
[$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I think he was there.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVhat say you of Mr. (^Herring^) ?            #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I think he was.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVhat say you of (^Mr. Cauton^) ?             #
[$ (^Iaquel.^) $] In truth, I cannot tell.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVhat say you of (^Mr. Robinson^) ?           #
[$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I think he was.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] What say you of (^Mr. Drake^) ?               #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] VVas Colonell (^Vaughan^) there?              #
[$ (^Iaquel.^) $] Yes, I conceive he was there.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was Master (^Iackson^) there?                 #
[$ (^Iaquel.^) $] Yes. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was Capt. (^Far^) , and   #
Capt. (^Potter^) 
there? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I believe so. [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was Mr.   #
(^Gibbons^) there? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I cannot tell.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] What say you of Mr. (^Sterks^) ?              #
[$ (^Iaquel.^) $] No Sir, I do not know it.
   [$ (^Att.^) $] Did you not know him to be the (^Scotch^) Agent?   #
Was he not taken among you to be an 
Agent from (^Scotland^) ? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] Yes, he was a (^Scotch^) #
man.
<P 42>
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] And for contribution of money, what money did  #
you pay, and to whom? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Two 
five pounds to Mr. (^Drake^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] For what use? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] For charitable #
uses.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Then he asked it of you so, or for that        #
purpose; but afterwards, What did you learn it 
was employed about? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Sir, he did not tell me how he #
did employ this money; but afterwards, 
I heard him say, that he had sent (^Titus^) money.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What did you contribute to (^Sterks^) his      #
going into (^Scotland^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Ten shillings.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] And who else did contribute, that was there?   #
and how much was the sum that was 
collected? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I cannot tell.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] How much do you guess, or have heard?          #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Four or five pounds, I think.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Ask him who gave the Scotchmen money?          #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Truly, I did give several Scotchmen 
money, both to poor Ministers and others, that were banished by the  #
Act, because I knew they were 
very poor, and knew not how to get away; and I did it out of charity #
towards them.
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Because the State had an ill opinion of them,  #
therefore you had a good opinion of them.
   [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] There was one Minister that had twelve children #
that was banished.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Were you at any meetings at Mr. (^Loves^)      #
after (^Dunbar^) fight? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] No not I.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] At what Fast were you at, and who officiated   #
at those Fasts? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I was at Major (^Adams^) , 
and Colonel (^Bartons^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Who did exercise at those Fasts? was Mr.       #
(^Love^) , Mr. (^Jenkyns^) , Mr. (^Case^) , any of them?
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I believe they were, I conceive so, I profess I    #
cannot remember, I believe Mr. (^Jenkyns^) was 
there.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Was not Mr. (^Love^) one of them?              #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes, he was.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What was the occasion of those Fasts?          #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I know no particular occasion, but for the 
good of the two Nations.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] How do you know they were for the good of the  #
two Nations? was it not for an agreement 
between the King, and the (^Scots^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I confess,   #
it was for the Good of both Nations, as both 
Nations are the Church of God; and do both profess themselves        #
Protestants, and of one Religion; 
and I conceived, it was my duty to pray for the good of them both.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] But was there not some expressions for a 
blessing upon the Treaty at (^Breda^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I 
cannot remember such expressions; for in such duties, I desire to    #
have my heart lifted up unto God:
And, my Lord, it is a great while ago.
   [$ (^L. Pres.^) $] Will you say your heart is lifted up unto God, #
when your understanding is in your heels?
   [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] My Lord, I do not remember one passage in       #
prayer a week after.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] That is in ordinary meetings, but this was for #
both Nations; but by what did you know, 
that this was for the good of both Nations, and why was it pretended #
to be for the good of both? 
and, my Lord, why they should not meet before, but just at that      #
time, and at a private Fast? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I 
think that since the Nations of (^England^) and (^Scotland^) were at #
oddes, I have been at twenty Fasts.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] My Lord, ask him, whether he were not late     #
with (^Potter^) , and did not meet with him about 
Letters from 
(^Bamfield^) , and whither they went to read them? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] #
This was about (^February^) or (^March^) 
last, he told me he received Letters, and desired me to go along     #
with him to Mr. (^Loves^) , and after Dr. 
(^Drake^) came in, and then these Letters were read; and I profess,  #
I know not from whence they came, 
nor the man; and so did Mr. (^Love^) declare, That he never saw, nor #
knew, nor heard of (^Bamfield^) 
before.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Did he not make mention of Parties in          #
(^Scotland^) , that one party was for the King, 
another for the King and Kirk, a third neither for King, nor Kirk?   #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] But who were those he named, that were men for #
the King? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I think, (^Hamilton^) and 
his party. [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] And who for the King and Kirk?         #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] (^Argile^) and (^Leshley^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] And who neither for King nor Kirk?             #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] (^Straughan^) and (^Car^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What, did he tell you of the young Kings       #
escaping? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Something there was in that, 
but he was fetched back again.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What said he of (^Argile^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] #
Nothing at all, as I remember.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Was there not an expression, That they were    #
now agreed to receive in the whole Nation, 
unless it were those that were notoriously scandalous and            #
excommunicated? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I believe 
there was.
<P 43>
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Did it not mention five thousand pounds for    #
providing of shipping? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes; in 
the Narrative or Letter, whether there related at that time, I know  #
not.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] And what mention was there made, who were fit  #
to command in (^England^) , if that party 
should come from thence into (^England^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I       #
conceive there was three Noblemen.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Name them. [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] My Lord of        #
(^Suffolk^) , my Lord of (^Warwick^) , and my Lord of 
(^Manchester^) , or either of them.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] That was propounded                            #
[^SOURCE TEXT: prepounded^] by (^Bamfield^) , but I    
hope those Lords were more noble, then to do any 
such thing: Was there not another Letter that came with that of      #
(^Bamfields^) , sent by my Lord of (^Argile^) , 
and it was onely, That there should be an apbrobation of him: And    #
was this Letter likewise read at 
the same time, and at the same place? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes, my Lord.   
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What was then propounded for money to be       #
raised for (^Bamfield^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Truly, Captain 
(^Potter^) did make mention for Forty pounds to be raised, Ten       #
pounds for Colonel (^Bamfields^) man, and 
thirty pounds for (^Bamfield^) himself; but that business at the     #
reading was wholly declined, and absolutely 
refused by all, to act any thing in that relation, in which it was   #
sent over; whereupon, Captain (^Potter^) 
did move, that if nothing were done in that, whether it were not     #
convenient to send the Messenger 
something to bear his charges; says he, If you will pay the          #
messenger Ten pounds, and send (^Bamfield^) 
Thirty pounds, I will give the messenger the Ten pounds; but there   #
was no Agreement, nor 
Conclusion, I know of, no Bill of Exchange that was sent, but        #
Captain (^Potter^) said, he would lay down Ten 
pounds.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] But no body spake against Captain (^Potters^)  #
laying down of Ten pounds; and it was 
propounded to you to lend Ten pounds, and you said you would         #
consider of it; but did (^Potter^) lend it?
   [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I cannot tell that, my Lord, he said he would   #
do it.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] My Lord, let now Master (^Jaquel^) tell you    #
what was the cause, why they did refuse to do any 
thing in the Letter about Five thousand pounds; what was the cause   #
upon the debate between you at 
Mr. (^Loves^) house? why you did refuse to do any thing about the    #
Five thousand pounds? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] The 
debate was soon over; for we absolutely refused it, we would not     #
meddle in it, not liking the business; 
it was a trouble, I am confident, to them that heard it read.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] You do not remember that ever any body did     #
acquaint the Magistrate with the design in 
working from (^Scotland^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] No, not I.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Did not some say, That (^Bamfield^) was a      #
malignant? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I cannot tell, but I never 
heard of him before.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Were you not told he was a Cavalier, and of    #
the Kings side, and that that was the true 
reason, why they would not trust him? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I do not     #
remember any such thing.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Did Mr. (^Love^) agree for Ten pounds for      #
(^Bamfields^) man, and Thirty pounds for (^Bamfield^) ?
   [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] No, I cannot say so.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Did not Major (^Alford^) tell you upon his     #
return from (^Calice^) , that he was sent thither to take 
an account thence? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] He did not, but (^William       #
Drake^) did tell me, that he was gone to (^Calice^) to 
speak with Captain (^Titus^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] And to take an account of the transaction at   #
(^Jersey^) . [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Truly Sir, I cannot say that, 
but (^William Drake^) told me, he was gone thither to speak with     #
(^Titus^) ; and this is above two years ago, 
that (^William Drake^) told me so.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] To what end? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] To tell and     #
hear news.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What did he do more? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I       #
profess in the presence of God, I cannot tell Sir, I 
beseech you; for in the Paper I told you before, there were some     #
circumstances, and something that I 
cannot say; but it was to this purpose, To speak with (^Titus^) , to #
hear the news from (^Jersey^) , but I cannot say 
certainly that word.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] We do not press you to the word, but to the    #
effect of it; my Lord, I think (^Mr. Jaquel^) hath 
given an account already, that this relation was at (^Mr. Loves^)    #
house. (^Mr. Jaquel^) , let me bring one thing 
to your remembrance, if it be true, At your meeting at (^Mr. Loves^) #
house, upon this business of (^Bamfields^) 
Narrative, you say, Thirty pounds was moved to be sent to            #
(^Bamfield^) , and Ten pounds to his man. 
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes, by Captain (^Potter^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] And when it was then said, it was thought fit  #
by (^Mr. Love^) , (^Mr. Drake^) , and Captain (^Potter^) , 
that it should be so done, whether did you not all agree it should   #
be so done? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] No, there was 
no agreement, but it was thought convenient, or to that purpose.
<P 44>
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] It was thought convenient by all the company  #
present? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] Truely Sir, there 
was not much regard taken in that businesse, nor was there much      #
done; for we did not stay long, 
but there were such words.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] But by all present? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] Yes,    #
there were such words.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Whether were not some friends at dinner at    #
(^Dowgate^) , and was not (^Mason^) there?
   [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] My Lord, There was a Gentleman there, I cannot  #
say, who he was, nor did I see him 
before or since.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Who did they tell you it was? did they not 
tell you, (^Mason^) ? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I professe, I cannot 
remember that, nor can I tell, but I conceive it was so.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] In your Examination, you say it was           #
(^Mason^) . [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I said, I conceived so.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Why did you believe so? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I   #
cannot tell, but as I remember, (^William Drake^) 
told me, It was so.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Whether when (^Bamfields^) letter came, and   #
the letters from my Lord of (^Argile^) , 
(^Lowden^) , and others came, Was there not a letter from            #
(^Baily^) ? [$ (^Iaquel.^) $] I do not remember, my Lord.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Nor from the Generall Assembly?               #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I do not remember any such thing.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Bethink your self, you are upon your oath,    #
whether he that brought letters from (^Bamfield^) , 
did not bring letters from (^Baily^) , and from the Generall         #
Assembly? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I cannot [^SOURCE TEXT: cannnot^] remember 
there was any such thing spoken of there.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there no expression of letters of thanks  #
for the good affection of the Presbyterian 
party here, and encouragement to persevere? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] I do   #
not remember any such thing.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there no promises, that when they by      #
their indeavours should get a free 
Parliament in (^England^) , that they would re-imburse all that was  #
laid out [$ (^Jaq.^) $] I do remember no such thing.
   [$ (^Mr. Love.^) $] I would ask him some questions; and the first #
is, whether he hath spoken this as a meer 
relation, or whether he owns all this he hath spoken, as under an    #
oath?
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] We are past that my Lord, he did say, he was  #
under an oath.
   [$ (^Mr. Love.^) $] If he say so, I am concluded. [$ (^Mr. Jaquel #
made no answer to this.^) $]
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] You have asked two questions in a few words:    #
for the first, whether he speak it under 
an oath; you know, that time was spent to declare it before he       #
began: If you ask of his owne 
knowledge, you mistook it; for he saith something he hath by         #
relation, and some that he knows: 
this hee hath taken notice of, what should wee further examine over  #
the same thing; for he saith 
some of his own knowledge, some by relation from particular parties, #
and some from parties he cals not
now to mind: and it was declared by the Court, that he was a         #
witnesse, and the Court accepted him.
   [$Mr. (^Love.^) $] I desire your Lordship to ask him this         #
question, whether the supposed Narrative that 
hee speaks of, that (^Alford^) said he brought over, and read at my  #
house, was read at my house; 
or onely by (^Alford^) , and so brought over as news?                #
[$ (^Jaquel.^) $] In truth, my Lord I cannot 
tell that.
   [$ (^Mr. Love.^) $] He speaks of (^Sterks^) a (^Scotch^) man, I   #
desire your Lordship to know wether hee knows, 
or can affirme by the oath you say he hath taken, that he was a      #
(^Scotch^) Agent. [$ (^No answer to 
that question.^) $]
   [$Mr. (^Love.^) $] Sir, Ask him this question, he mentions a fast #
at Major (^Adams^) , or Col. (^Bartons^) , 
and that for the good of both nations; because he thought they were  #
the Church of God; whether 
there was any intimation in that meeting, that it was under this     #
notion, for the good of both 
Nations; whether that meeting was for the (^Scotch^) Nation to       #
invade the (^English^) Nation. [$ (^No 
answer to [^SOURCE TEXT: to to^] that question.^) $]
   [$Mr. (^Love.^) $] He said, (if I have taken him rightly, and if  #
not, I desire your Notaries to inform 
me better) that Mr. (^Love^) did not agree to such a summe as forty  #
pounds, and afterwards hee 
said, that all there said, it was convenient. Now I would ask how    #
these two can agree together?
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] You are right; for the thing of agreement he    #
disclaimed totally.
   [$Mr. (^Love.^) $] Then I did not agree to it.
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] No, nor any else.
   [$M. (^Love.^) $] But afterwards he sayes, that they did conceive #
it was convenient; Now, I pray ask 
him, how he knew that I thought it was convenient? [$ (^Jaquel.^) $] #
I cannot say any thing that Mr. 
(^Love^) did say it was convenient; but it was not dissented from,   #
nor spoken against by any, as I 
remember. [$ (^Mr. Jaquel withdraws.^) $]

<P 46>
[$ (^Captain^) Far (^is called into the Court, and is sworn^) .$]
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, let him acquaint you with what       #
passed at the White Hart in (^Breadstreet^) . [$Cap. 
(^Far,^) $] I desire the benefit of my Papers.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] At whose request did you come to the          #
white Hart in (^Breadstreet^) , and when was it?
   [$ (^Far.^) $] By (^William Drake^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Was that the first time you were acquainted    #
with any thing of this nature, for carrying on 
and prosecuting of an order, to the furtherance of an Agreement      #
between the (^Scots^) , and the King? 
VVhat do you know of that, at what time was the meeting?             #
[$Cap. (^Far.^) $] It was about two years since.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] VVhat was the discourse at that meeting?       #
[$Cap. (^Far.^) $] It was the drawing up of some heads 
of a Letter, which might be sent to (^Scotland^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What was the effect of it? [$Cap. (^Far.^) $]  #
It was to this effect, to the best of my memory; for 
it is so long since. [$ (^Here Captain^) Far (^was at a stand, 
whether through infirmity of speech (for he seemed to 
be slow of speech) or otherwise, I cannot say; and he or the^)       #
Attorney General (^for him, made great use of the 
Papers of his Examination^) .$]
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] To desire them, the better to bring them to an #
agreement, that there might be moderate 
Propositions. [$Cap. (^Far.^) $] It was to moderate their desires in #
the agreement, between the King and the (^Scots^) .
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] What to do? [$Cap. (^Far.^) $] That they might #
abate of their demands.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] Of their former demands, that they might be    #
the more like to agree; was it not so? [$Cap. 
(^Far.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
<P 47>
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was it not propounded likewise, that some     #
should be sent to the King, to perswade him to 
give satisfaction to the (^Scots^) ? [$ (^Far.^) $] It was           #
propounded by (^Titus^) , but not approved of.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] But did you not agree to send to the          #
(^Scots^) that you did agree to, and were there not heads 
which (^Titus^) , or (^Drake^) , did undertake to write, and         #
afterwards were drawn up? [$ (^Far.^) $] I saw no letters.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] But did not (^Drake^) tell you he had sent    #
them to Master (^Baily^) in (^Scotland^) ? [$ (^Captain Far 
being at a stand, the Atturny Generall asketh him again.^) $] Did    #
not (^William Drake^) tell you, a letter was 
sent accordingly into (^Scotland^) ? [$ (^Far.^) $] Yes he did tell  #
me, he had sent letters.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, let him give you Lordship an account #
before the Treaty at (^Jersey^) , where (^Drake^) 
met with him, and what he propounded to him, whether to send to      #
(^Jersey^) , and what persons, and upon 
what message? [$ (^Far.^) $] Mr. (^Drake^) did say, that Captain     #
(^Titus^) did say, It was requisite for one to be 
at the Treaty at (^Jersey^) , and I had it from (^Drake^) , that     #
(^Titus^) did undertake to go himselfe thither.
   [$ (^Att. Gen.^) $] What was his imployment to be there, and what #
money was to be raised for him? -- Did 
he tell you he wanted money? [$ (^Far.^) $] After (^Mr. Drake^)      #
desired, I would help him to ten pounds, and 
(^Titus^) was in want of money to relieve his necessities; and upon  #
this request I did leave ten pounds 
in (^Mr. Drakes^) Ware-house.
   [^ATTORNEY-GENERAL SPEAKS:^] VVas (^Drake^) present?              #
[$ (^Far.^) $] I think he was, I was promised it again, but never    #
received it.
   [$ (^At. Gen.^) $] My Lord, Let him inform after this negotiation #
of (^Titus^) was ended at (^Iersy^) , whether 
there was not a letter written by (^Titus^) , and whether this was   #
not read in the presence of (^Mr. Love^) , and 
some others, and whether at (^Mr. Loves^) or no?
   [$L. (^Pres.^) $] Upon the ending of the Treaty at (^Iersey^) ,   #
and (^Bredah^) , were you not present at (^Mr. Loves^) 
house, when it was signified from (^Titus^) , that it was not        #
convenient for him to come into (^England^) , 
because he thought he was discovered to the Councell of State, and   #
desired some body to be sent to 
(^Calice^) to take an account there of his negotiation?              #
[$ (^Far.^) $] Yes, my Lord, I was there.
