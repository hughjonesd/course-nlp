[}A DISCOURSE BETWEENE THE BURGUER
AND THE YEAMAN}]
   Ho Yeaman, from whence lead you
that load of wood? that load of fagots,
of great wood, and of logges?
   [$P.$] Sir, I bring it from the wood: I bring 
it from the forrest: I bring it from the field,
from the groue, from the hedges, from the
vnderwood, from the bramble bushes: from
our land towne, from our village, and from
our hammell.
   [$B.$] Is it good? is it dry? is it wood of birch?
is it oaken wood?
   [$P.$] O yea Sir, it burneth well: it burneth like
brimstone.
   [$B.$] Yeamanesse, good wife, haue you no fresh
egges? haue you any ducke egges? some
pullets? some fresh butter? some sweet or
sowre milke? some good sweet creame?
some creamed, or curdded milke? any
churned milke, or new cheese?
   [$P.$] Yes, yes, Sir: O yea! I haue some of all
sorts, and good to eate.
   [$B.$] How much sell you the dozen of fresh
egges? the pound of butter? the pint, or the
pot of your milke?
   [$P.$] Sir, come your wayes and see, and I will
giue you good cheape of all.
   [$B.$] I will, well, let me see it then if it please
you.
   [$P.$] Goe to, come, come: of which doth it
please you to haue Sir?
   [$B.$] I will some of all sorts, measure me, sell
me: make me good measure: measure mee
well: sell me good cheape: ouerprize not
the price thereof: Goe to, take your money:
render me my rest: but how much will you
haue? how much should I giue you? tell
me quickly.
   [$P.$] Sir, you know it well: you know it so
well as I: hold, take women then. Adieu till
I see you againe good wife.
   [$B.$] Ho, speake good wife: hola, speake:
hearke here a little: haue you spunne the fine
flaxe, and the hempe of my Lady, &c. or
mine? haue not you bleached my fine linnen
for to make some shirts? my threed, and
my coorse linnen for to make some sackes;
and some other paultry for mine houshold,
and for to accommodate my children and
my seruants?
   [$P.$] No truly Sir yet: for I haue had no
leasure since: it hath alwayes beene drie
weather since, I assure you.
   [$B.$] Is not yet my corne ripe in the fields?
   [$P.$] Yes Sir, it is long agone: it behoues you
but make ready your worke folkes: but
your mowers, your shearers, and your
cutters of corne.
<P 174>
[^REPETITION OF PREVIOUS UTTERANCE OMITTED HERE.^]

   [$P.$] Yes Sir, and Madame; all are well.
   [$B.$] My bore, and my hogges, my sowes and
my pigges, do they feed well with oakornes
of oake? with chesnuts, or other graine?
   [$P.$] Ho, ho, Sir, a Sow or a Hog doth eate
of euery thing, though it should bee of a
stone, or of iron.
   [$B.$] Are they in the wood, in the groue, in
the forrest, or in the stie?
   [$P.$] Yea, yea, Sir: O yes! they are alwayes in
the wood.
   [$B.$] Are there any of them eaten with the
wolfe, with the she-wolfe, with the foxe,
with the she-foxe, with the beare, with the
she-beare, or with the badger?
   [$P.$] O no! for they can defend themselues
well with their clawes, with their pawes,
and with their great pointed and sharpe 
teeth.
   [$B.$] What say you? is it possible? truly I
beleeue it not.
   [$P.$] Yea truly it is true: I assure you that it is
very true.
   [$B.$] Is not this here, my caroch, my coach,
my chariot, my cart, and my litter.
   [$P.$] Yes, yes, sir, and all their equipage; as the
harnesse, the furniture, and their
necessities.
   [$B.$] Haue you spanged my horses to the
chariot?
   [$P.$] Yes, Sir, I spanged them the other day
for to carrie some dung, and some dunghill,
for to fatten the land, the yarde, and the
field.
   [$B.$] Well, well, it was well done. Till me the
land well, the fields, and the yards with the
plough, and the harrow: and harrow me
also the land, the field, and the yard, after
that you shall haue ared, sowne, and
accommodated them.
   [$P.$] Sir, I shall not faile to doe it: I shall not
misse to doe it.
   [$B.$] Thresh me well the corne with the flaile
in the barne, on the floore: and fan, riddle,
and make very cleane, my graine, out of his
chaffe, and straw: and chiefly my wheate.
Moreouer, feed well, and take heed to my
Pigeons, Hennes, and Pullets; to my
Peacocke, & to my Peahen: to my Turky cocks,
and to my Turkyhens: and to all their little
chickens: and aboue all to my Doue-coat.
<P 175>
   [$P.$] Sir, there shall be no fault in all that: wee
shall take heed to all.
   [$B.$] Adieu good man, and good wife: God
keepe you from euill.
   [$P.$] Adieu Sir, adieu Madam vntill the next
market day.

[}A DISCOURSE BETWEENE A CAP. AND HIS
INFERIOUR OFFICERS AND 
SOULDJERS.}]
   [$C.$] My Lieutenant, mine Ensigne, my
Serjeans, and my Corporals.
   [$O.$] What doth it please you sir? will you 
haue any thing?
   [$C.$] I beleeue we must march, take our way,
and make a voyage to morrow: that it
behoues vs to beate to the fields one of these
dayes, or very soone.
   [$O.$] Sir where if it please you? in what part
must we goe? march? take our iourney? or 
make our voyage?
   [$C.$] Doe not you know? against the enemy,
in the fields, in the champion field.
   [$O.$] Sir, what sort of enemy? what sort of
folkes be they?
   [$C.$] The Spaniard, the Castilian, the Italian
and the Albanians.
   [$O.$] The ill man breake his armes, the head
and the legges.
   [$C.$] Amen, amen: so be it: so may it happen
vnto him.
   [$O.$] Sir, is he so neere? is hee so nigh? is hee
verie neare?
   [$C.$] Yes, yes: see here he is at hand: behold,
he is here at our flankes: see here hee is
behind vs: see here he is within a shot of a
cannon, of a musket, of a harquebuse, of a pistol,
to vs.
   [$O.$] Then shall it be for his harme, for his
damage, and to his losse.
   [$C.$] Sir, since it is so, cause the horsemen to
aduance, the troops, the men at armes, the
carbins, the dragons, the light horsemen,
the fantassins, the lanciers, the
scoppetiers, the harquebusiers on horsebacke: and
all the other braue Voluntaries that follow
after vs.
   [$O.$] Sir, see here they are all: see here they
come: and are all armed, equipaged and
ready. Behold also the barded horses that
conuoy the cannon, the baggage, and all the
munition, to wit, the powder, the bullets,
the cannon bullets, the match, the cariage,
the harnesse, the attirals, the victuallers, the
pinoniers, the mules, the mulers, the asses,
the nags; and all their equipage: and all
others munition and furniture of war.
   [$C.$] Musketiers, be ready: Pikemen aduance
you to the front, quickly, quickly. Halt:
hold you still without any words: silence.
<P 176>
Giue the word to the Sergeant from hand
to hand. Make them keepe their rankes, and
hold them ready for all occasions.
   [$O.$] Sir, we will doe it, and protest all to die
and liue with you.
   [$C.$] I thanke you my masters: I thanke you
fellowes.
   Have courage my masters: take courage
fellowes: if it please God we shall all be rich:
we shall all be mounted, equipaged, and in
better order to morrow: wee shall well
recompence our long journeyes, and our great
trauell. For the Spaniards haue gold chaines
about their neckes, and great store of
pistols in their purses; without other fine white
money, so well rials, as mattes: and many
other sorts of money very fine and good.
    Sa, sa, prepare you: for they come and tell
vs, That the enemie is here at hand. Do not
ye heare his horses neigh? Light your
matches from hand to hand. Light your matches
at both the ends. Cocke your matches:
bullet in mouth.
   A brace of Sergeants from hand to hand.
Keepe your rankes: to your long order:
silence: no words, momme, halt, halt.
   Musketiers, are ye ready? giue fire, giue
fire. Ho, ho, let vs charge, charge, kill, kill.
Shoot, harquebusiers and musketiers. Haw
pikemen, aduance, aduance: charge, charge,
sa, sa, sa. Let vs giue on, let vs lay vpon those
robbers, for they shall pay very deare their
boldnesse: they shall pay deare their
rashnesse and comming.
   Cut, cut their throats: for euen so well
shall they cut yours, if they abide masters of
the battell, of the Champion field, of the
field, and of our Campe.

[}LITTLE WORDS BETWEENE A SCHOOLE-MASTER,
AND ONE OF HIS SCHOLLERS.}]
   [$E.$] Master, is the French tongue vneasie,
or difficult for to learne.
   [$M.$] No, no: in no wise: O no!
   [$E.$] Tell mee the reason thereof: tell mee the
cause thereof: tell me the subject: tell mee
wherefore.
   [$M.$] Because (as it seemeth to me) that by the
meanes of the grace, the fauour, and the
assistance of God, there is nothing done, or
ordained by him, but it is easily learned: I say
concerning tongues.
   [$E.$] Notwithstanding men say, That the
Bible, the holy Scriptures, the holy Writs, the
holy Letters are very mysticall, and vneasie
to be vnderstood?
   [$M.$] Well yea of the euill liuers, and of those
which neglect the duty which they owe to
our Lord: but concerning the faithfull,
<P 177>
they bee but tales, that they vnderstand
them not: yea euen so well as they wish,
prouided they vse good diligence, therein
praying the Lord to reveale to them the true
sense thereof.
   [$E.$] But who forbids then that euery one
should reade it?
   [$M.$] The Romish Church, the Church of
Rome: the Popish Church: the Church of
humane traditions: the Church of men.
   [$E.$] Hath it beene forbidden of God? of
Iesus Christ?
   [$M.$] No neuer: but (contrariwise) it hath
been instituted for mens saluation (fearing
God) generally to all sorts of men, yong, or
old, so well men as women: so well boyes
as wenches: so well fathers as mothers: so
well children as seruants, and seruing maids:
so well men of Church, as men of the fields
or trades men.
   [$E.$] Why haue those men done that? tell me
the reason thereof?
   [$M.$] Ile tell it you? Couetousnesse is an euill
canker, which hath beene the cause of it,
and is yet cause of many other euils in the
world.
   [$E.$] Then that hath also beene cause that the
Lord hath excluded his Word from such
folkes?
   [$M.$] Yea: and hath blinded them in their
wickednesse yet more: because they haue
shut the gate on him, when hee hath
knocked, desiring (by great mercy) their well
and saluation.
   [$E.$] But Master, why bring you mee here the
passages of the holy Scripture, and sacred
things, when I demand you other vocables
of little consequence?
   [$M.$] It is for feare least all my Schollers should
neglect their owne duty towards their
Parents, and betters: to wit towards God first,
and his holy Word: and also to their Fathers
and mothers: Secondly, to their Superiours,
and folkes which they ought to reuerence:
thirdly, to keepe irrefragable amitie with 
their brothers and neighbours.
   [$E.$] Sir, I see then by that meanes, that
carelesnesse, and our lusts, are bad things: are euill
vices, obstacles, and lets, which hinder vs to
feare the Lord?
   [$M.$] Yes truely: truely yea: truely your
reason is good.
   [$E.$] Sir, doe not you tell mee also that those
cursed vices, those cursed lusts: our wicked
flesh: the fragile, fraile, and soft worldly
things: all sorts of cupidities doe hinder
vs to know the Word of God: the
heroicall renowne of vertue the chast, and manly
<P 178>
force (which we ought to enjoy betwixt the
yong age, vntill the age of Adolescence and
virilitie.
   [$M.$] Yea, I tell you the pure truth thereof: for
euery man that loseth the time after his lusts,
doth lose his courage: loseth his renowne:
loseth the force of his body: puts his bodie
in many dangers: strayeth himselfe from the
favours of God: tormenteth his conscience:
encurreth many excesses and scabs,
excrements, cathaires and euill humours.
Moreouer, dulleth his noble memory: putting
himselfe also in danger of the pockes, of
gangraynes, and vlcers which doe gnaw his
body: cuts him the thread of life before euer
he come to halfe age: where contrariwise,
he who feareth God (taking the time by the
end) and reading his Word: and betakes him
selfe to study, and to vertue (which bee the
true rudder of the faithfull, and generous)
shall sit among the learned, and graue men,
to giue counsell for the good and state of a
Common-wealth. Furthermore, the Lord
will fulfill him his Saying, dictated by the
holy Ghost, and by the mouth of his seruant,
and Prophet Dauid, Saying, &c.
[^VERSE OMITTED.^]
   [$E.$] Maister, doe not the debauches, and
our lusts hinder the bringing vp of
the youth [^SOURCE TEXT: yonth^] , our studies, and foraine tongues?
as the Latine, the French, the Italian, and
many other.
   [$M.$] Truely child, there is no doubt of it: for
what more honour can men get in the
world then to know to speake foraine
tongues? since that by S=t= Pauls own mouth
esteemes them worthy to be learned, calling
them the grace, and the gift of the Lord.
<P 179>
   [$E.$] Maister, is the French tongue very
needfull, and profitable among the Nobilitie?
   [$M.$] Yea, and yet more profitable among the
Merchants: for except it be the Latine: me
thinkes, it is the most profitable of all
Christendome: and almost, it is so much in vse
(if I durst say it) as the Latine, and rather
more.
   [$E.$] Is it so easie, and docile to bee learned as
the Latine?
   [$Ma.$] Yes, much more: yea more then the
halfe.

   [$ (^N.^) $] It seemeth to mee that you are yet sleeping?
   [$ (^T.^) $] For to say the truth, I am not yet well
awaked.
   [$ (^N.^) $] Ah if sluggishnes were vertue; how
many vertuous should there be in the world?
   [$ (^T.^) $] It should be pity: for I should bee of

   [$T.$] No, giue me the shooing horne to pull
on my shooes.
   [$R.$] Sir, doth it please you that I pull them
on to you?
   [$T.$] No, thinkest thou that I am so lazie?
   [$R.$] What know I? it should neither bee
meruell nor miracle.
   [$T.$] Trusse vp my points loosly, and not
with hard bound knots, for to make me cut
them.
   [$R.$] Sir here is one that is not tagged.
What Girdle doth it please you to weare to

my haire.
   [$R.$] Sir, looke there is your come case
vpon the Window.
   [$T.$] Where be my gloues? I see them not.
   [$R.$] Sir, you forgot them yesterday in some
part.
   [$T.$] Go to the Glouer, and by me a paire of
kidleather.
   [$R.$] Sir, will you haue them perfumed?
   [$T.$] I care not, prouided they keepe my
hands fresh and delicate.
   [$N.$] My God! you are long a dressing
you.
   [$T.$] Sir, who goes softly, goes surely and
safely: I come presently.
   [$N.$] But Sir, what doe you with so many
garments?
   [$T.$] I cloath the~ according to the weather.
   [$N.$] How many haue you to change?
   [$T.$] Sir, I haue for to change one euery
day in the weeke.
   [$N.$] You do not go cloathed as I do? to wit
like a figure, and alwayes of one fashion.
   [$T.$] Truly sir, you do it for your pleasure,
and not of necessitie.
   [$N.$] How many sorts haue you of them?
   [$T.$] Sir, I haue but of Veluet, of Satin, of
Damaske, of Grogeram and of Fustian.
   [$N.$] Sir, you are very happy to enjoy of all
your commodities so ready.
   [$T.$] Yea it is you sir, who enjoyes the
pleasures of the world!
   [$N.$] No sir, it is you who can pisse in the 
bed, and say you haue sweat in it.
   [$T.$] Sir, I haue nothing but it is at your
commandement and seruice.
   [$N.$] Sir, I doe acknowledge it, and thanke
you very humbly for it.
   [$T.$] Sir, I do not as many doe, who thinke
neuer to be cloathed, if they haue not their
warderobes and trunkes full.
   [$N.$] Truly (may bee) Sir, those men haue
their cloathing furred with great debts.
   [$T.$] Sir, behold therefore, I content my selfe
with these few that I haue.
   [$N.$] Who is content of a little, enjoyeth                       #
[^SOURCE TEXT: enjoyerh^] al
things.
   [$T.$] A content heart, is a good cloake for
his shoulders.
<P 186>
   [$N.$] Sir, Why do you cloath you so
warmlie.
   [$T.$] For to liue as it shall please God, and
to follow the Prouerbe.
   [$N.$] How do you say that Prouerbe?
   [$T.$] Cloathe thy selfe warmly: eate oft and
little: drinke now and then (if God please)
and thou shalt liue long.
   [$N.$] Truly Sir, hee who can doe his owne
affaires, will doe another mans worse.
   [$T.$] He who doth his owne affaires,
defileth not much his hands with them.
   [$N.$] Sir, if it please you, let vs dispatch, and
hast vs a little.
   [$T.$] The greatest haste is the least worke,
and by spurring to much [^SOURCE TEXT: muchs^] make the flight 
the longer. Ile be more handsome to pare
my nailes.
   [$N.$] Sir, you anger mee to make mee
languish so long.
   [$T.$] Sir, I haue not yet washed my face, nor
my hands: nor I haue not trussed me.
   [$N.$] Sir, are you euery day so long in bed?
   [$T.$] Yes sir, sometimes, according as I goe
to bed.
   [$N.$] You annoy me very much to make me
stay for you, and wishing so long for your
most agreeable company!
   [$T.$] Sir, but what be the mortell paines?
   [$N.$] To stay for those that come not: to be
in bed and sleepe not: to serue and please
not: to haue a horse that goes not: to stray
when one desires not: to be at a gate when
they open not: and to haue a friend that
betrayes thee: are six things for to kill
thee.
   Truly Sir, those bee the paines which I
endure, and haue endured very often.
   [$R.$] [^SOURCE TEXT: E.^] In good truth Sir, I endure the first of
them at this present houre.
   [$T.$] Sir, beleeue me, you shall endure it no
more, for I haue done.
   [$N.$] God be praised, haue you once done?
   [$T.$] Sir, doth it please you to take a cup of
wine before you goe forth?
   [$N.$] Sir, it should be no great sinne.
   [$T.$] Are you accustomed to drinke in the
morning, or to make collation?
   [$N.$] I accommodate my selfe with all
things, and I am like a Millers sacke, and not
as some doe whiles, making consciencce to
spit in the Church before folkes, & would
doe worse if none should see them.
   [$T.$] Ho Rupsa, bring vs hither some
drinke.
   [$R.$] What is your pleasure Sir, doth it please
you to haue any thing?
<P 187>
   [$T.$] Bring some bread, some wine, and a
napkin.
   [$R.$] Sir, I will bring them you presently.
   [$T.$] Rinse and wash the glasses and the
Cups.
   [$R.$] Well Sir, see there they bee faire and cleane.
   [$T.$] Poure in some wine, and giue vs some
drinke.
   [$N.$] Sir, I know not how you can drinke so earely?
   [$T.$] Very well Sir. This to your good
health.
   [$N.$] Sir, I loue it from you, and Ile pledge
you with a very good heart.
   [$T.$] Rupsa, giue some drinke to Maister Nalano.
   [$N.$] Sir, support me in that, for I drinke
not often out of meale time.
   [$T.$] Sir, the morning drinke is good for to
charme the mist.
   [$R.$] Sir, doth it please you to haue any
other thing?
   [$T.$] Giue me my sword, my poniard, and
my cloake: helpe me to gird them on me.
   [$N.$] Sir, that cloake doth become you
very well.
   [$R.$] Sir, shall I goe with you?
   [$T.$] No, not, dresse vp the Chamber, and
shut vp all.
   [$N.$] Sir, I pray you let vs loose no more
time.
   [$T.$] Sir, I am ready, goe before and I will
follow you.
   [$N.$] I had rather shew my selfe indiscreet,
then disobedient.
   [$T.$] Hola, Boy. follow me.
   [$R.$] Sir, I come, but I go first to shut the
gate and the doores.
   [$T.$] Thou saiest well: but shut them with
the keye.
   [$N.$] who shuts well, opens well.
   [$T.$] True, and who feareth God, falleth
neuer in mischance.

   [$T$] God giue you a good morrow, sir.
   [$H.$] And to you likewise sir, a good
morrow and good yeare.
   [$T.$] The Lord grant you a good morrow
Sir.
   [$H.$] Sir, the same be giuen vnto you with
all happinesse.
   [$T.$] Sir, God giue you all good lucke and
all prosperity.
   [$H.$] Sir, I wish you the same with a good
heart.
<P 188>
   [$T$] What are you going to doe so alone?
   [$H$] Sir, I would not be alone in Paradice.
   [$T.$] Notwithstanding it is better to be alone
then in euill company.
   [$H.$] He who betakes himself to be with you
is well accompanied.
   [$T$] Sir, how doe you doe this morning?
   [$H$] Sir, ready to doe you any seruice.
   [$T$] Sir how goes it with your health this
morning?
   [$H$] Sir, very well, at your
commandement.
   [$T.$] How haue you done since the other
day?
   [$H$] Sir, I haue done well, and found my
selfe well, praised be God.
   [$T.$] Truly sir, I reioyce alwaies of your
welfare.
   [$H.$] But whether are you bound to goe in
such hast?
   [$T.$] Sir, I take my way towards S. Paul his
Church [^SOURCE TEXT: Chutch^] .
   [$H.$] And you sir, whither goe you so alone?
   [$T.$] I will goe walke a little.
   [$H$] And you sir, so well as I, whither is it
that you doe goe?
   [$T$] Sir, I am going to the Exchange.
   [$H$] Sir, doth it please you to haue company?
   [$T$] Sir, very willingly, if I do not
importune you.
   [$H$] No truly sir, I shall be very glad of your
company.
   [$T$] And I sir, most glad of yours.
   [$H$] Sir, doth it please you that I keepe you
company?
   [$T$] Sir, you shall doe me great honour and
pleasure.
   [$H$] Sir, I would not trouble you so much.
   [$T$] No forsooth, sir, you should rather doe
me honour.
   [$H$] Sir, doth it please you to goe by land, or
by water?
   [$T$] Sir, it is euen as it shall please you, it is
all one to me.
   [$H$] If you finde it good, let vs go by water.
   [$T$] Sir, that which liketh you pleaseth mee
infinitely.
   [$H$] Where shall we then ship in?
   [$T$] Sir, at S. Paul his Key.
   [$H$] It is true, sir, a very commodious place.
   [$T.$] Sir, enter then into the Boat.
   [$H$] That will I not doe by no meanes.
   [$T$] Sir, doth it please you to enter into the
Boat?
   [$H$] Sir, to what end serue those ceremonies
betweene you and I?
   [$T$] Sir, I will enter then for to obey you.
<P 189>
   [$H$] We are happy to haue two such strong
men.
   [$T.$] Euen as the Carters do serue vs by land,
so also the mariners and watermen, doe vs
pleasure and ease by water.
   [$H$] Truly sir, I am of your opinion.
   [$T.$] How like you this going by water
in Boats?
   [$H$] Sir, indeed I take pleasure to goe by
water, but more to goe by land, and better
without danger.
   [$T$] Why? is it by chance that those horses
do please you that haue their bridles behind
them?
   [$H$] Truely sir, they doe not please me at
all, when I remember of a lesson that my
father was wont to tell me now and then.
   [$T.$] Sir, what lesson if it please you to tell
mee?
   [$H$] Well sir, he tould me often, When I
was able to goe by land, that I should neuer
goe by water.
   [$T$] Notwithstanding, men were wont to
say, That hee who trauelleth not by sea,
knew not what the feare of God was.
   [$H$] And also he who trauells not by land,
knows (no more) what solace, sport, and
pleasure is.
   [$H$] Sir, shall wee passe vnder the bridge
since that the tide goes forth?
   [$T$] Sir, to what vse are Bridges made?
   [$H$] To passe ouer them, and not vnder
them.
   [$T$] Why will you then wee passe vnder
them?
   [$H$] Ho, ho, sir, I vnderstand you well.
   [$T$] Where shall we take land?
   [$H.$] Sir, at the end of the Bridge if it please
you.
   [$T$] On this side, or yonder side of the Riuer?
   [$H$] Sir, as it shall be most commodious for
you.
   [$T$] On this side then, for to bee the neerer
the Exchange.
   [$H$] Sir, your opinion, What time of the
tide is it?
   [$T$] Sir, I know not if it flowes or ebbes.
   [$H$] Me thinks it flows, if I be not deceived.
   [$T$] Sir, what haue you to doe at the
Exchange, if it please you?
   [$H$] Sir, I am to dispatch some businesse
of mine.
   [$T$] Sir, what businesse haue you there to
bring to end?
   [$H$] Sir, I am to speake to a friend for some
worke of mine.
   [$T$] Sir, thinke you to finde him there?
   [$H$] Yea forsooth, for he did promise me
so yesterday.
   [$T$] On what side hath he assigned you to
finde him?
<P 190>
   [$H.$] Where the Italians do walke, or there
about.
   [$T.$] Think you that he wil keep his promise?
   [$H,$] Yes sir, for I take him to bee an
honest man.
   [$T.$] Who promises and keepes not is not to bee
trust to.
   [$H,$] Sir, you are in the right, but I trust to his.
   [$T.$] Good God keepe mee from those in
whom I trust, for I shall keepe me from
those whom I mistrust.
   [$H,$] Sir, he gaue me so good words, that
I could not refraine but trust him
   [$T.$] Doe not you know, that the wicked
deedes, and the faire words, doe beguile the
wise men so well as fooles?
   [$H,$] Sir, I know it well, but if he strike me
with his sword, Ile strike him againe with
my scabbert.
   [$T,$] Sir, you will then render him a loafe
for a cake.
   [$H,$] Sir, if it be possible, do neuer ill to
him that wishes you any, for by hatred
Nature is corrupted.
   [$T,$] Notwithstanding (Sir) the wicked
ought to be punished.
   [$H,$] It is true sir: but it is said, That to a
Wolfes flesh, must be giuen a Dogs tooth.
   [$T,$] Sir, what a clocke is it now?
   [$H,$] Sir, it is about ten a clocke.
   [$T,$] Sir, what houres be those that strike?
know you?
   [$H,$] Eleuen Sir, it is eleuen a clocke.
   [$T,$] Sir, what a clocke may it be?
   [$H.$] Sir, it cannot fail, but it must be twelue.
   [$T,$] Sir, Ile goe see at the Sunne Dyall.
   [$H,$] But (to the purpose) VVhere will you
dine to day?
   [$T,$] Truly (Sir) I know not yet where I
shall dine.
   [$H,$] Sir haue you made a promise any
where?
   [$T,$] Sir, in no wise, if I can remember.
   [$H,$] Sir, doth it please you wee dine
together?
   [$T,$] Sir, I desire no other thing.
   [$H,$] Shall we go then to some Ordinary?
   [$T,$] Sir, as it shall please you.
   [$H,$] Goe before and I will follow you.
   [$T,$] Sir, if it please you, Ile goe before and
guide you the way.
   [$T,$] Sir, God doth favour me much, making
me haue so honourable a Guide as you are.
   [$T,$] Sir, I beleeue we are come too late.
   [$H,$] Thinke not that, for it is yet very earely.
<P 191>
   [$T.$] Sir, doth it please you to stay for me a
little here, and Ile come presently againe.
   [$H.$] Sir, in the mean time Ile walke a turn
or two through the Exchange.
   [$T.$] Sir. let it not displease you, Ile go speak
with a Gentleman.
   [$H.$] Sir, truly with all Authority, and not
with licence.
   [$T.$] Now goe to, I haue ended my busines:
shall we goe home and dine?
   [$H.$] Sir, I pray you, for I haue a good 
stomocke.
   [$T.$] In good truth (Sir) that is a very good
token of Health.
   [$H.$] I giue God thankes, I finde my selfe
alwaies able and frolike of the body.
   [$T.$] Sir, and of your Purse, how do you 
feele it whiles?
   [$H.$] Sir, alwaies ill disposed and
languishing.
   [$T.$] Truly Sir, the disease is so common that 
euery one feeles it.
   [$H.$] Sir, haue not you drunke to day?
   [$T.$] Not yet Sir, and you?
   [$H.$] Sir, I goe neuer forth of my lodging
before I drinke a good Cup.
   [$T.$] I neuer vsed my selfe to it, but hence
forth I will doe it.
   [$H.$] My God Sir! see here Mr. (^Iohn^) comes
to see you.
   [$T.$] Truly it is he indeed, ah! Mr. (^Iohn^) ,
you are very heartily welcome.
   [$I.$] Sir, I kisse your hands very humbly.
   [$H.$] VVell my Masters, what shall wee doe
vntill dinner time?
   [$I.$] I agre to all things, provided wee doe
any thing.
   [$T.$] My maisters, Ile refer my selfe to the
Company.
   [$H.$] Let vs then make some game at the
Tenis.
   [$I.$] Iust, for this morning doth require it
being so cold.
   [$T.$] And there after we shall all go dine
together.
   [$H.$] And also after noone wee will goe see
some Comedy.
   [$T.$] How Sir, they are but repeating of old
Histories.
   [$I.$] Pardon me Sir, for in England are plaid
true Comedies.
   [$H.$] Yea Sir, and true Tragedies also, if men
would seeke them.
   [$T.$] My Masters, but let vs resolue to doe
something [^SOURCE TEXT: sometehing^] for to [^SOURCE TEXT: ro^]     #

that one of vs stand by.
   [$I.$] I will stand by, play ye two together.
<P 192>
   [$ (^T.^) $] Not so, if it please you wee will cast
lots for it.
   [$ (^H.^) $] No Sir, make that I be a beholder, and
not a player.

vs two play together.
   [$ (^T.^) $] Sir what advantage will you give me?
   [$ (^I.^) $] Sir, I will not play, if I play not like to like.

   [$ (^I^) $] Sir, the last is no chase, but a losse.
   [$ (^T.^) $] Sir, how is it a Losse?
   [$ (^I.^) $] Because you did strike it at the second
bound.

   [$ (^I.^) $] And (^I^) a duce.
   [$ (^T.^) $] Sir, (^I^) haue an Advantage.

selfe, and render me my rest.
   [$ (^P.^) $] What money is this here that (^I^) know it 
not?
   [$ (^I.^) $] Doest thou not see that it is a crown of
the Sunne?
   [$ (^P.^) $] Sir, I haue no money for to change it
to you, and then it is too light.
   [$ (^T.^) $] Weigh it then, for (^I^) know well that it
is weight.
   [$ (^P.^) $] Truly Sir, it is too light by foure aces.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Sir, how much must you haue backe
againe of your rest?

Ile disburse for him.

   [$ (^H.^) $] My Masters, since that we haue done,
where shall we now goe?
   [$ (^T.^) $] As for me I will goe to my chamber.

   [$ (^T.^) $] Truly Sir, it is for to take my rest, for
(^I^) am weary.
   [$ (^I.^) $] My Masters, let vs rather go to my lodging.
   [$ (^H.^) $] Sir, that is the best advice, since it is
not far from hence.
   [$ (^T.^) $] Let vs then goe apace, for it is late.
   [$ (^I.^) $] (^I^) see not yet the houre for to set me to
the table.
<P 194>

[}THE EIGHT CHAPTER.}]
   [$I.$] This may be called a miracle that thou
art come so quickly againe.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, to say the truth, I haue taried no
where.
   [$ (^I.^) $] What good newes hast thou heard?
hast thou done my Busines?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, I did see Master M. but not Master
P. because he was gone abroad.
   [$ (^I.^) $] And what good newes hath Master M.
told thee?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, what would you he should say?
you know well he is full of gentlenesse.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Child, I know it well, and so will I
praise him all my Life time.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Verily Sir, he deserues that men
honour him very much.
   [$ (^I.^) $] It is true: for he is so curious that hee
growes fat doing good to others.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Truly Sir, if he eate no other thing he
should be in a poore estate.
   [$ (^I.^) $] But what said he to thee?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, hee rendreth you his Salutation
with double vsury, and thankes you kindly
for your good remembrance of him.
   [$ (^I.^) $] I am very glad that hee is in so good
Health.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Moreover Sir, he sayes, If he could but
set his foot abroad, hee would not faile to
come himselfe and kisse your hands.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Goeth not hee then yet forth of his
lodging?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, with great paine can he stand on
his Feet, he is so weake.
   [$ (^I.^) $] What did hee for to driue away the
Time?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, he was lying aboue his Bed,
playing on the Lute.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Knowest thou if he playes well or no?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, what know I? I know no more
then a Swisser.
   [$ (^I.^) $] But how doth it seeme to thee?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, according to my poore judgement
me thinkes he playes very well.
   [$ (^I.^) $] He playes also very well on the Violl,
on the Cister, Virginals, and on the Flute.
   [$ (^I.^) $] But what folks hath he in his lodging?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, I haue seene no body there, but a
deformed, hardfavoured, foule, heavy, deaf,
blind, dumme, squint-eyed, blind of one eie,
vncleane and hideous Baud.
<P 234>
   [$ (^I.^) $] Verily! child, his house may then bee
called a Hell.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, and yet worse, hauing such a
wicked wife in his lodging.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Hath shee beene faire heretofore?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, you may well thinke! for shee is
cloathed like a Nunne, coiffed like a
Puppet, lame of one Arme, crooked of one
Foot, blinde of one Eie, the other
bleare-ey'd, hulch-backt, crumpshouldered, bald,
flat-nosed; and that little shee hath is all
wrinckled, and with great hanging Eares.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Alas! I have great compassion on him:
but what said she to thee?
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, all toothlesse as shee was, began to
raile and scould on me, giving mee injuries,
and disdaining mee on the Market place in
the sight of everie one (I being ashamed to
flee away) shee approched verie nigh mee
and gave me a terrible blast of her stincking
Breath.
   [$ (^I.^) $] It may be thou hast done some mischiefe
unto her, in dispraise of her beautie, or by
any bad or vndecent words.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir excuse mee, for I had never seene
her before: and I beleeve there is not
such an intricate and vilde Drabbe in the
World.
   [$ (^I.^) $] O what terrible things thou makest me
beleeve!
   [$ (^I.^) $] Then shee is much vnlike one that I 
have seene to day.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, how know you if she be fairer then
she that I have seene?
   [$ (^I.^) $] Because shee hath none of those Parts
that thou esteemest her to haue.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, which bee the fairest parts that a
Woman ought to haue for to bee reputed,
and to make her verily faire?
   [$ (^I.^) $] They be three White, three Black, three
Red, three Long, three Short, three Big, three
Fine, three Narrow, three Broad, and three
Little.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, make mee know that faire Worke
of God (in his Creatures) if it please you.
[^VERSE OMITTED.^]
<P 235>
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, thinke you that there are found
such Women ouer all where?
   [$ (^I.^) $] Yea, a thousand in this Towne, and
more.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Goe in the street and see if thou findest
Maister R. walking there.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, I did see him goe towards his
lodging now presently.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Goe tell him that I would faine speake
a word with him: and knocke at the Gate,
to the end thou markest him well for to
know him an other time, when I send thee
thither.
   [$ (^L.^) $] Sir, I haue remarked him enough
already: but if you will command mee thither
any other thing, behold I am ready to
dispatch your [^SOURCE TEXT: yvur^] Commandements.
   [$ (^I.^) $] Goe then quickly and pray him that
hee would take the paines to come hither, if
it please him.
