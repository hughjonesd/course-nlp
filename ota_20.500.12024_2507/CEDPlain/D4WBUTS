<P 1>
[$She was indicted by the name of (^Joan Buts^) , late of (^Yoel^) , #
in the County
of (^Surrey^) , for that she being a common (^Witch^) and            #
(^Inchantress^) , and not
having the fear of God before her eyes, but moved by the instigation 
of the Devil, she did by her wicked and devilish Art, betwitch (^Mary
Farmer^) , and brought her into a languishing Condition; in which    #
languishing
Condition she continued until she died.$]
   [$She was indicted a second time, for that she being a common     #
(^Witch^) and 
(^Inchantress^) , &c. she not having the fear of God before her      #
eyes, but guided by the
Instigation of the Devil, she had by her wicked and devilish Art,    #
bewitched 
(^Elizabeth Burrige^) , and brought her into a languishing           #
Condition, &c. To both
which Indictments she pleaded Not Guilty [^SOURCE TEXT: Gulty^] ;    #
and for Tryal, put her self upon God
and her Country.$]
   [$The Witnesses being sworn, the Parents of (^Mary Farmer^)       #
swore, That their
Child being taken ill in an extraordinary and violent manner, the    #
Neighbours
told them it was bewitched, and perswaded them to go to Dr.          #
(^Bourn^) , which they
did, and (^Bourn^) told them, That their Child was under an ill      #
Tongue, and
advised them to save the Childs water, and put it into a Bottle,     #
stopping it close,
and bury it in the Earth, and to burn the Childs Clothes, assuring   #
them, that
then the (^Witch^) which had done her the hurt, would come in; and   #
that accordingly
they did so; and when the Childs clothes was burning, (^Joan Buts^)  #
came in, and sat
her down upon a Stool, looking with a most frightful and gastly      #
Countenance;
and being asked by a Woman that was there present, what she ailed?   #
she answered,
<P 2>
She was not well, nor had been out in seven weeks before;$] why      #
would you
come out now then, [$said the Woman?$] I could not forbear coming    #
to see you,
[$said she; and with that, she threw down her Hat and tumbled down,
wallowing on the ground, making a fearful and dismal noise; and      #
being got up, she
fell a cursing in a most horrid manner. To this purpose swore divers #
others, who
were present at the same time.$]
   [$ (^Elizabeth Burrige^) , who was one of the persons bewitched,  #
swore, That going
out of her Masters house in the evening, towards the Barn-door, she  #
saw a
Goose, or some such creature, coming towards her; whereat being much
affrighted, she run in a doors, telling them what she saw;           #
whereupon, her Mistris, with
some others of the house, went out to see if they could see any      #
thing; and being
out, there were stones thrown at them from every side, and they      #
could not see
from whence they came; so that they were forced to retire into the   #
house; 
and having shut the door, the stones were thrown as fast in at the   #
window,
and yet not one Quarrel of Glass broken. Her Master swore, that she  #
being
in the middle of the Room, she suddenly screamed out, saying,$]      #
Something is
got into my back, [$when going to her, he pulled out a great piece   #
of Clay
from about the middle of her back, stuck as full of pins as ever it  #
could hold.
The Maid swore also, That going the next morning a milking, she saw  #
(^Joan
Buts^) , bedagling her self among the Bushes; whereat being          #
affrighted, she came
home and told them, that she had met such a woman that used to come a
begging to the house, she not then knowing her name; but they told   #
her, it was
Goody (^Buts^) . Her Master swore likewise, that sending her up      #
stairs, to fetch
him something out of a Trunk, she called out,$] Master, here is      #
Goody (^Buts^) ;
[$but going up stairs with several others, they could not see her,   #
but they saw
several things in the Chamber move out of their places, there being  #
no body
near them; and that coming down stairs, an Andiron that stood in the
Chimney, removed out of its place, and flying over their heads, fell #
down before them; 
and that the Maid crying out again, that something was got into her  #
back, he took
out another great piece of Clay, stuck as full of thorns as the      #
other was of
pins.$]
   [$Others swore, That they had divers times taken out pins from    #
the Arms, and
other parts of (^Mary Farmar^) ; which was also proved by divers     #
others that had seen
them taken out.$]
   [$And one of the Evidences swore, that he heard her say, That if  #
she had not
bewitched her, if all the Devils in Hell could help her, she would   #
bewitch her.$]
   [$She pleaded, she was innocent, and that those things that were  #
sworn against her,
were not true. My Lord asked her, if she did not speak those words:  #
she
acknowledged she did:$] but my Lord, [$said she,$] I am a            #
passionate woman, and they having
urged me, I spake those words in passion, my Lord, but I intended no #
such thing.
   [$She said of one of the Witnesses, whose name is (^Hakeing^) ,   #
and reputed to be a very
sober man, that he had given himself to the Devil Soul and Body. My  #
Lord Chief
Justice asked her, How she knew he had done so; to which not being   #
able to give
any answer, my Lord cheked, and told her that she must not abuse the #
Witnesses at
that rate. There was in all about Ninteen or Twenty Witnesses        #
against Her. And
the Tryal was near three hours long. The Jury having been some time  #
out, returned and
gave in their Verdict that she was not Guilty, to the great          #
amazement of some who
thought the Evidence sufficient to have found her Guilty; yet others #
who consider the
great difficulty in proving a Witch, thought the Jury could do no    #
less than acquit
her.$]
