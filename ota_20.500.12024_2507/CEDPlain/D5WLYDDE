[}AN
ACCOUNT OF THE TRYAL OF (^RICHARD LYDDEL^) , 
ESQ; (^&C.^) }]

   [$The Jury being sworn to try the Issue between the Right         #
Honourable
the Lord (^Abergavenny^) , Plaintiff, and (^Richard Lyddel^) , Esq;  #
Defendant,
upon an Action of Trespass; for that he the said                     #
(^Richard Lyddel^) , did carry
on a criminal Correspondence with the Plaintiff's Lady, by which Means
he did debauch, carnally know, and committed Adultery with her, to the
great Loss, Disappointment, and Uneasiness of the Plaintiff.$]
   [$The Council for the Plaintiff, after having learnedly opened    #
the Circumstances of the
Offence, and peculiar Aggravations attending it, with Regard to the  #
Defendant, proceeded to call
in the Witnesses, who deposed as followeth.$]
   [$The First Evidence that was called to prove the Charge against  #
the Defendant was
(^Elizabeth Hopping^) : She depos'd, That she lived in his           #
Lordship's Family for six Years, and
about three Weeks before (^Christmas^) was Twelve-month, the Family  #
being at (^Sheffield^) House,
his Lordship's Country Seat, took Notice of Mr. (^Lyddel's^)         #
frequently kissing her Lady in the
Dressing Room, thought the Familiarity was too great betwixt them,   #
and unbefitting, gave
Occasion to her to watch their Conversation; that she had seen her   #
Lady's Bed tumbled after
it had been made, when none but Mr. (^Lyddel^) and her Lady had been #
in the Room: That
another Time knowing them to have been in the Dining Room, below     #
Stairs, about nine in
the Morning, was willing to see what they were doing, and placing    #
herself in the
With-drawing-Room, she look'd through the Key-hole into the Parlour, #
and opposite to the Place
where she stood, she saw her Lady against the Door that went into    #
the Hall, and Mr.
(^Lyddel^) against her, that she saw her Lady's Petticoats up as     #
high as her Gartering-Place, and that
he had unbuttoned his Coat, but could not see his Breeches down,     #
because his Coat behind
covered them; that she saw him do something that a Man ought not to  #
do: Being
ask'd, What she thought he was doing; Reply'd, She thought he had a  #
criminal
Conversation with her Lady, and being surpriz'd, she look'd a second #
Time, when she then saw
them in the same Posture: And that then, as soon as she could get    #
out, she went and
acquainted one of her Fellow Servants, which was the Laundery Maid,  #
that she had seen her
Lady with Mr. (^Lyddel^) against her, with her Petticoats up, and    #
told her, she thought he
was debauching her Lady. Being ask'd whether she thought they were   #
in criminal
Conversation together both the Times? She said, she believed they    #
were; that they were standing
against the Door, which kept it shut, for it opened into the Room,   #
and was not fastened.$]
<P 4>
[$Being ask'd, What was the Ground of her Suspicion? She reply'd,    #
she saw him often kiss
her in her Bed-Chamber, Dining-Room, and Dressing-Room. Being ask'd, #
How Mr. (^Lyddel^) was received by his Lordship when he came there?  #
She replied, His Lordship always
received him very joyfully; that Mr. (^Lyddel^) came very often, and #
staid there sometimes a
Week together, and that it was frequent he staid there so long, that #
he lived from his
Lordship's House about seven Miles. She being ask'd, Why she did not #
acquaint her Lord with
it? Reply'd, she thought her Lord would not believe it, but that she #
told her
Fellow-Servant, (^Elizabeth Letchmere^) , and that she told no other #
Servant of it. Being ask'd, How
it came to pass when she saw so notorious a Fact, that she did not   #
discover it presently to
her Lord? Replied, that no Person dare open such a Thing to his      #
Lordship, that it was 
discovered by her, but not 'till her Lord asked her about it. Being  #
asked, Whether there was
any Key in the Key-hole of the Lock that she peeped through, or any  #
other Covering to it
within side? Replied, there was not, neither was there any Thing to  #
hinder her from
looking. Being ask'd, Whether the Door she look'd through was        #
lock'd? Replied, that she
knew nothing of that, but the Key was out, for they had been         #
cleaning the Locks.$]
   [$The next was (^Elizabeth Letchmere^) , who depos'd, That her    #
Fellow-Servant came to her,
and told her, three Weeks before (^Christmas^) was Twelve-Month,     #
that her Mistress was a
Devil; that she asked her the Reason, she then told her she looked   #
through the Key-hole and
saw her against the Door in the Parlour with her Petticoats up, and  #
Mr. (^Lyddel^) before her,
that this was about nine in the Morning. Being asked, Whether she    #
discovered it to any
Body? Replied, she told only Mr. (^Osbourn^) of it.$]
   [$-- (^Pinches^) deposed, That the Observation she made, was when #
Mr. (^Lyddel^) came to
her Lady, about a Twelve-Month ago; her Lady gave her Orders to go   #
out of the Room
when Mr. (^Lyddel^) came; that the Bed was unmade when he came, and  #
when she went up
to make it, she found the Door was lock'd, that when her Lady gave   #
her Notice of it once
or twice she kept out of the Way. Being asked, Whether it was usual  #
for her to leave the
Room when Visiters came to her Lady? She replied, that she never did #
when she was
making the Bed; and that Visitors never came into her Lady's         #
Chamber, but into the Dressing
Room. Being further ask'd, Whether, when her Lord was at home, she   #
never saw my
Lord and Mr. (^Lyddel^) in my Lady's Chamber together? Replied, she  #
never knew them
together there.$]
   [$ (^Mary Hodson^) deposed, That she lived two Years and two      #
Months with the Lord
(^Abergavenny^) in Town and Country both, and served in the Family   #
as a Laundery Maid; that as
she hath stood at her Window, which faces her Lady's Dressing-Room,  #
she hath seen Mr.
(^Lyddel^) take her Lady by the Pinners and kissed her, that when he #
had pull'd her Lady away,
the Window-Shutters were one quarter or half shut too; that she hath #
observed this
several Times, taking her mostly by the Pinners, and kissing her;    #
that she saw this very plainly,
the Shutters were shut more than once, even several Times. Being     #
asked, How long after
he hath kissed her Lady, that she hath observed the Window-Shutters  #
to be put too?
Replied, about a quarter of an Hour. Being asked, Whether these      #
Observations were made in
Town? She reply'd, yes; the Building of the Laundery is a back       #
Building cross the
Gravel Court, right against her Lady's Dressing-Room.$]
   [$ (^William Smith^) deposed, That he was Porter to my Lord       #
(^Abergavenny^) , and that he was
ordered by his Lady, whenever Mr. (^Lyddel^) came to admit him, that #
she would not be at home
when Mr. (^Lyddel^) was there, but when Mr. (^Lyddel^) was gone his  #
Lady would be at home
to any Body that came; that Mr. (^Lyddel^) was always admitted, and  #
that was his Direction.
That when Mr. (^Lyddel^) hath been at his Lordship's, his Lordship   #
and he have gone out
together, and he hath returned again before him, and gone to the     #
Appartment of his Lady,
That Mr. (^Lyddel^) and a Gentleman have dined together with his     #
Lady, went out together,
and Mr. (^Lyddel^) has returned again, and staid with his Lady two   #
Hours; that when he came
he used to ask him, whether his Lady was at home; and if the Footman #
hath been out of
the way, he hath waited upon him himself to her Lady's Appartment;   #
that he was always
admitted; when his Lord was at home he would go to his Lordship's    #
Appartment, and
afterwards from his Lordship's to his Lady's. Being asked, Whether   #
he ever knew him deny'd
when his Lord was at home? He reply'd, he never did.$]
   [$Mr. (^Matthews^) being called, was ask'd by the Plaintiff's     #
Council, what Station he was in
under the Plaintiff, answered, That he was his Gentleman; and being  #
desired to give an
Account to the Court of his seeing Mr. (^Lyddel^) and his Lady       #
together in the Room, and what
he observed, replied, he had a great many Suspicions of a criminal   #
Correspondence
between Mr. (^Lyddel^) and his Lady; that he had taken Notice that   #
his Lady would order none
to be let in but Mr. (^Lyddel^) ; that one Evening his Lady said,    #
she would be at home to none
but Mr. (^Lyddel^) ; That he went up and found none but Mr.          #
(^Lyddel^) there with his Lady, and
only two Candles burning, then he went and brought up two others,    #
that there might be
<P 5>
Light in the Room, that when he came to go into the Room the Door    #
was fast; that he
heard his Lady run from the Couch to the Fire-side, which is but six #
Foot, she opened the
Door and said,$] you fling the Door so hard you'll make the Bolt     #
fly; [$that when he came in
he saw Mr. (^Lyddel^) upon the Couch, as if he were putting up his   #
Breeches; that he had since
flang'd the Door several Times, and found the Bolts not to fly. That #
when he went into
the Country he had several Pair of Leases to engross for his Lord's  #
Tenants; that the
Appartment he lay in was under Mr. [^SOURCE TEXT: Mr,^] (^Lyddel's^) #
Room, called the (^White Room^) ; that one Morning,
as he was engrossing of Leases, he heard a Woman coming into that    #
(^White Room^) ; that he
[^WORD REPEATED: he^] heard the Voice of a Man, and presently heard  #
the (^White Room^) Bed crack. This was
the first Morning, (^October^) the (^13th^) . That he says, he heard #
a Woman come into the (^White
Room^) , just over his Head; that he heard the Man, and heard the    #
Bed crack, upon which
this Deponent declar'd himself to be in a great Surprize, but was    #
resolved to see who came
out; that he went half way up the great Stairs, and saw Mr.          #
(^Lyddel^) coming out of his
Room,$] who desired me to call his Servant to him. [$That running as #
hard as he could, he
met one of his Lord's Servants, and desired him to send Mr.          #
(^Lyddel's^) Man up to his Master,
after which he went up the Back-Stairs through the Long Gallery, and #
saw his Lady come
out very red, and in Disorder, and thought she had been in Mr.       #
(^Lyddel's^) Room. Being
asked, whether he afterwards met with her, and in what Room?         #
Reply'd, that the next
Morning, the (^14th^) of (^October^) , he was then writing as        #
before, and about nine a-Clock he
heard a Woman come in after the same Manner, and heard the Step of a #
Man, and the Bed
crack, as the Morning before; then he went up the Back-Stairs, and   #
at the End of his Lord's
Gallery he took off his Wig, and laid himself down, that no Body     #
might see him; that he
heard the Bolt of Mr. (^Lyddel's^) Door open, then he saw Mr.        #
(^Lyddel^) come out of his
Chamber Door looking about him, and going in, immediately his Lady   #
came out, with her
Hands spreading her Petticoats; that there was a Door at the End of  #
the Gallery, from
whence he could see all along the Gallery. Being asked, whether from #
that Place where he
was he could hear the Door open? He reply'd, that he heard the Door  #
unbolted, and he
saw Mr. (^Lyddel^) come out of his Room, and presently after he went #
in, and his Lady came
out holding her Petticoats on each Side, but when he saw her he got  #
up with a Book  in his
Hand, as waiting his Lord's getting up in the Morning, which was his #
known Practice; that
then his Lady went into her own Dressing-Room. Being asked, whether  #
his Lady came out
while Mr. (^Lyddel^) was at the Door? He reply'd, that he went in    #
first, and then his Lady
came out. Being ask'd why she held her Petticoats after such a       #
Manner? Reply'd, because
Mr. (^Nevell^) , that was in a Room hard by, should not hear the     #
rustling of her Silks. The
next Day, being (^Wednesday^) , this Deponent was from Home, and     #
could make no
Observation. That on (^Thursday^) he was in his Room, and heard the  #
same Noise in the (^White Room^) ,
after the same Manner as he had done before. In the Afternoon of the #
same Day he
acquainted Mr. (^Osman^) , his Lord's Steward, for he said he could  #
not bear to see his Lord
injured after such a Manner. He was asked, whether Mr. (^Lyddel^)    #
came out of the Door and
look'd about him this Time, as he had done on the (^Tuesday^)        #
before? He reply'd, that he did,
and that his Lady came out as before, but whether she went into the  #
Nursery or into his
Lord's Appartment he was not certain. That on (^Friday^) , as he was #
writing again, he
prevailed with Mr. (^Osman^) to be present with him, and when they   #
were together, he ask'd Mr.
(^Osman^) whether he did not hear some Body come in? He said, yes;   #
and in a little Time they
heard a Bed crack; that this Deponent said to Mr. (^Osman^) ,$] in a #
little Time you'll hear the
Bolt of the Door make a Noise, [$and so it happened, for they being  #
at the Bottom of the
great Stairs; Mr. (^Osman^) told him he heard it very plain, and saw #
the Lady come out of Mr.
(^Lyddel's^) Room, with her Petticoats held up by her Hand as she    #
used to do, to prevent the
Gentleman that lodged by her from hearing her. That (^Saturday^)     #
Morning was the same
Thing; that this Deponent and Mr. (^Osman^) heard and saw as before. #
Being ask'd what
Method he took in order to have it discovered? Replied, that he      #
discoursed with Mr. (^Osman^) ,
and they consulted together what Method they should take, that       #
several Mornings they had
had those Consultations; further, that he acquainted Mr. (^Day^)     #
with it. It being ask'd, what
Conclusion they came to? He reply'd, it was agreed upon that their   #
Lord should know of
it some way or other, they propos'd the Discovery should be made by  #
his Lordship's
Mother, but she was under a great deal of Concern about it, and      #
desired some Body else might
do it; that then they thought no Person so proper as Mr. (^Day^) to  #
do it, who is a Neighbour
and Relation of his Lordship's. Mr. (^Day^) accepting of the         #
Proposal did communicate it.
Being ask'd, when it was communicated to my Lord, what Answer did he #
give of what his
Lordship would do? He reply'd, that Mr. (^Day^) told him, that his   #
Lordship$] was willing
that we should surprize him in the very Act. [$He gave this          #
Direction to Mr. (^Day^) and Mr.
(^Osman^) .$] The Method that we took was, that Mr. (^Day^) , Mr.    #
(^Osman^) and myself were to
conceal our selves in a Closet, adjoining to the Room where Mr.      #
(^Lyddel^) lay, and on the
<P 6>
8th of (^November^) last, about six in the Morning, we all placed    #
our selves there; [$that they
staid there till about nine, at which Time her Ladyship came into    #
Mr. (^Lyddel's^) Room,
went round it, and was heard to say with a low Voice,$] (^I cannot   #
stay with you now^) ; [$upon
which Mr. (^Day^) and Mr. (^Osman^) thinking her gone were for going #
away, but this Deponent
acquainting them that she was not, prevailed with them to stay, and  #
he listning very close
heard a Noise, upon which they all went together into the Chamber,   #
and coming softly to
the Bed-side withdrew the Curtains, upon which Mr. (^Lyddel^) cry'd  #
out,$] (^O God^) ! [$That this
Deponent saw her Ladyship in a very indecent Posture, and in a very  #
great Surprize she said,$]
(^Dear^) Matthews (^do not ruin me^) ; [$upon which he said he was   #
very sorry for what was done,
she repeated again,$] (^Do not ruin me^) ; [$he told her that he was #
sent by his Lord's Direction,
and that he must be true to his Lord. That Mr. (^Lyddel^) in his     #
Surprize seem'd not to have
heard what was said, and therefore cry'd out,$] (^What do you        #
say^) ? [$This Deponent answered
him,$] (^Sir, I thought you could not have been guilty of so foul    #
an Act^) . [$And Mr. (^Osman^) saying
to him;$] (^For you, Sir, to come so frequently, in such a Shew of   #
Friendship, and to wrong his
Lordship after such a Manner as you have done, is a Crime for which  #
you can make him no
Satisfaction^) ; [$that Mr. (^Lyddel^) replyed,$] (^it is very true, #
I can make no Satisfaction^) . [$Then he
said, he would take a Horse and ride away, and never return to his   #
Lordship's House any
more. Then Mr. (^Osman^) said to him, it was his Lordship's          #
Direction that he should be kept
there. This Deponent being ask'd, what Room this was in? Reply'd,    #
that it was Mr.
(^Lyddel's^) Room; that they lay cross the Bed when they opened the  #
Curtains. Being asked,
how many Days Mr. (^Lyddel^) was at his Lordship's at this Time? He  #
reply'd, that he came
the 7th of (^November^) . Being asked, who he received his           #
Instructions from; He reply'd,
from Mr. (^Day^) and Mr. (^Osman^) , and that his Lordship in his    #
Instructions said to them when
he went to Bed,$] (^Be sure when you come into the Room; and if you  #
find my Wife there, I
desire she may be used tenderly^) ; [$that this was over Night, and  #
they were taken together at nine
a-Clock the next Day. Being ask'd, what Directions his Lordship gave #
with respect to Mr.
(^Lyddel^) ? Reply'd,$] (^That in case we take them together in the  #
Manner we found them; that then
I should come to Town, and give Orders to Mr.^) Staples (^to proceed #
against [^SOURCE TEXT: againg^] him according to
Law^) . [$Being ask'd, what was to be done with Mr. (^Lyddel^) in    #
the mean while? Reply'd,
(^That his Lordship gave Directions to secure him in the House till  #
further Orders^) . This
Deponent being asked, whether he went to (^London^) after this?      #
Replied, yes, and went to Mr.
(^Staples^) , and made Affidavit of what he saw, upon which there    #
was a Process taken out,
which this Deponent delivered to the Sheriff's Bayliff, and was      #
executed on (^Monday^)
Morning; that then he supposes he was carry'd away to the County     #
Jail. Being asked, what Orders
were given about his Lady's going? He replied, that he had no Orders #
about her, but she
went away on the (^Saturday^) after the Discovery, very big with     #
Child.$]
   [$Mr. (^Osman^) depos'd, That Mr. (^Matthews^) came to him and    #
expressed himself much
concerned, with Relation to the Intimacies he had observed betwixt   #
Mr. (^Lyddel^) and his Lady,
and said, that Mr. (^Lyddel^) had abused his Lord, by lying with his #
Lady; and gave this
Deponent several Instances of it, as of his lighting Mr. (^Lyddel^)  #
up into his Lady's Appartment,
and finding but two Candles he went down for two more, and returning #
found the Door
fast, and knocking at the Door, heard his Lady go from the Couch to  #
the Fire-side, that when
his Lady had opened the Door she chid him for knocking so hard, that #
he then saw Mr.
(^Lyddel^) with his Hands in the Folds of his Clothes, and believed  #
he was putting up his Breeches:
This was the 12th of (^October^) . On the 13th of (^October^) , as   #
he was sitting in his Room
engrossing of Leases, he heard the Tread of a Man, then the Tread of #
a Woman, and in a
little Time after heard the Bed crack, and being willing to be       #
better satisfy'd, he went out
of his Room, and went up the great Stairs, and when he was half way  #
up, Mr. (^Lyddel^) came
out of his Chamber, and ordered him to call his Man to him, but      #
meeting with one of his
Fellow-Servants delivered the Message to him, afterwards he took to  #
a back Pair of Stairs,
and met his Lady just against the Nursery Room, the back Part of the #
Gallery, in very
great Disorder, and that he believed she had been in Mr.             #
(^Lyddel's^) Room. This Deponent
further says, that Mr. (^Matthews^) told him, that (the next Day     #
being (^Wednesday^) he was out
of the way) on (^Thursday^) Morning Mr. (^Lyddel^) and his Lady had  #
the same
Conversation as before; then Mr. (^Matthews^) desired this Deponent, #
that he would be with
him the next Morning, being (^Friday^) , accordingly he went to Mr.  #
(^Matthew's^) Room in the
Morning, and had not been there long but he heard a softly Tread     #
coming out of the
Green Room into Mr. (^Lyddel's^) Bed-Chamber, and in a little Time   #
he heard the Bed
crack pretty often; that Mr. (^Matthews^) carry'd this Deponent to   #
the Bottom of the great
Stairs, where he heard the Door unbolt, and Mr. (^Lyddel^) step out, #
as he supposed, to see
whether all was clear, and after he was gone in, the Lady came out   #
with her Petticoats up,
which he supposed was to keep them from rustling, there being a      #
Gentleman lying in a
Room on the other Side of the Gallery, at the Top of the great       #
Stairs. This Deponent
<P 7>
further said, that he heard the same on (^Saturday^) Morning as he   #
had done before; that he was
very much concerned and surprized at the Observation of these        #
Passages, and to find his
Lord abused after so gross a Manner, for he believed, that his       #
Lordship was a tender a
Husband, and had as great a Value for his wife as any Person in the  #
world, and that none
could be more fond; and though they knew it would be a great         #
Affliction to their Lord,
were notwithstanding resolv'd to acquaint him with it, for they      #
could have no Peace in
their own Consciences while they kept it as a Secret from him; to    #
which End Mr. (^Day^)
was acquainted with it, he accepted of the Office, and acquainted    #
his Lordship with it on
the sixth of (^November^) last, after this Manner; "He desired his   #
Lordship would be pleased
to walk in the Fields with him, for he had something to communicate  #
to him, but his
Lordship being very pressing to know what it was, Mr. (^Day^)        #
opened it to him; his
Lordship was extreamly concerned that his Friend had done such a     #
Thing, and said (^He could
not have done so to him^) ." Then his Lordship gave Directions to    #
make Discovery, which
was after this Manner:$] we proposed early the next Morning to go    #
into a Closet that joined
to the Room where Mr. (^Lyddel^) lay, which we accordingly did;      #
[$that this Deponent being
placed against the Closet Door could see the Room, and had such a    #
a Command of it that no
Body could go in or come out but what he must see; that a little     #
after eight a-Clock Mr.
(^Lyddel's^) Man went into the Room, and as he was coming out, his   #
Master being in Bed,
says to him,$] (^Are your Rasors ready, for I shall shave my self    #
by and by^) ? [$Then the Man went
out of the Room, and at nine a-Clock his Lady came along the Gallery #
to Mr. (^Lyddel's^)
Door, and entered the Chamber; that he saw her through the Key-hole, #
when she came
against it she made a Stop, and then went to Mr. (^Lyddel's^)        #
Bed-side, and said something
to him; then she returned, which made this Deponent conclude she was #
gone quite away,
likewise Mr. (^Day^) said she was gone, but Mr. (^Matthews^) was of  #
another Mind, and went
and opened Mr. (^Lyddel's^) Door, and stept to the Bed and undrew    #
the Curtains of the 
Bed-side, and said,$] (^So then^) ! [$the Lady was lying upon her    #
Back a-cross the Bed, and her Clothes
by that Time this Deponent came was down to her Knees, that he saw   #
her Legs; and that
Mr. (^Lyddel^) had nothing but his Shirt on; that she used several   #
Expressions in great Surprize,
and said,$] (^I shall be ruined^) , but we told her we were there by #
his Lordship's Direction; [$that
Mr. (^Lyddel^) raised himself up and said,$] (^What is the Matter? I #
have heard nothing you have
said^) , [$Then this Deponent said,$] (^We come to observe the vile  #
Treatment you have used towards
my Lord, and for this you can never give his Lordship                # 
Satisfaction^) . [$He said,$] (^It is very true,
I'll take my Horse and go away, and never return more^) ; [$upon     #
which this Deponent said,$]
(^You had as good stay while you are here^) , [$Being desired to     #
give an Account of the Friendship
which was between his Lordship and Mr. (^Lyddel^) , he said, that    #
the Friendship was very great,
that his Lordship always received Mr. (^Lyddel^) with a great deal   #
of Pleasure and Satisfaction,
that there was as good a Provision made for him by his Lordship, as  #
for any Body that came
to his House, that it was his Opinion that his Lordship's Secrets    #
were communicated to him,
and that he never knew of greater Friendship and Intimacy than there #
was betwixt his
Lordship and Mr. (^Lyddel^) . Being asked, when her Ladyship went    #
away after the Discovery? He
reply'd, She went away at three a-Clock the Day of Discovery, by his #
Lordship's Order, to
General (^Tatton^) her Father.$]
   [$Mr. (^James^) depos'd, That at the Desire of the Lady, he went  #
into Mr. (^Lyddel's^) Room on
(^Saturday^) Morning, on the 8th of (^November^) last, after the     #
Discovery was made, that when
he came into the Room he found Mr. (^Lyddel^) in a great Confusion   #
and Disorder, saying$] (^I
am a vile Wretch; for God's Sake do not speak to me; for God's Sake  #
do not speak to me^) .
   [$Mr. (^Day^) deposed, That he was his Lordship's Steward, and    #
took Care of his Estates in
several Counties, that he observed the Intimacy between his Lord and #
Mr. (^Lyddel^) , and in
his Esteem his Lordship was the greatest Friend Mr. (^Lyddel^) had   #
in the world, that there was
as intire Friendship betwixt them as ever was amongst Men, and that  #
their mutual
Respect for each other was very strong, so that this Deponent was    #
surprized when Mr.
(^Matthews^) let him into some of the Secrets of his Lady and Mr.    #
(^Lyddel's^) Intimacy, the first of
which was about the Month of (^March^) last; that he could not       #
conceive that Mr. (^Lyddel^)
would be guilty of so foul a Crime, when he knew the Intimacy that   #
was between his
Lord and him; he could not give Credit to those Reports till the     #
Account they gave him
of the Observations they made in the five Mornings, that then this   #
Deponent did believe it,
and that they fixed upon him to discover it to his Lordship, which   #
he did upon the 6th of
(^November^) ; that he asked his Lordship, (^Whether, considering    #
the great Affection he had for
his Lady, he could bear the Discovery of it^) ? That this Deponent   #
proposed the Method of the
Discovery which his Lordship approved of, and what he did by his     #
Lordship's Orders.$]
   [$The Council for the Defendant acknowledged, that a Verdict      #
ought to be given against
the Defendant, but used divers Arguments for Mitigation of the       #
Damages, as that the
Damages ought to be proportioned to the Circumstances of the Person  #
offending, that it lies
<P 8>
before the Jury, to give more or less, according to Circumstances    #
That the Defendant's
Estate is only an Estate for Life, and under great Incumbrances.     #
Another Argument was
offered, that this Action was not laid for an Assault in debauching  #
the Plaintiff's Lady, but for
destroying the Health, Satisfaction and Comfort of the Plaintiff,    #
that from the Time the
Fact was committed to the Time of her Death, was so short, that the  #
Injury his Lordship
sustain'd in his Health could not be very great. Another Argument    #
was the Lady's coming
into Mr. (^Lyddel's^) Chamber, by which Means she became a           #
Temptation to him, and was
a Temptation hard to be resisted; That this Fact between Mr.         #
(^Liddel^) and the Lady might
have been as well prevented as discovered, if they had thought fit,  #
but that it seem'd as if
an Agreement was made to lay a Snare and Temptation to draw him into #
a Criminal Action.
Another Argument is, that his present Affliction is a great          #
Punishment to him, and that even
the witnesses for the Plaintiff say, that he thought himself the     #
most miserable wretch living,
and if so, then what must his Affliction be now, that he ought to be #
considered as a very
unfortunate and unhappy Person, upon which Account there is no       #
Reason to charge much
Damages, as to be the total Ruin of him who is miserable enough      #
already.$]
   [$There were several Lords and Gentlemen appear'd to his          #
Reputation, who gave him the
Character of a very civil, modest, well-bred Gentleman, and could    #
never have thought he
would have been guilty of any Thing of this Nature. There were       #
several Mortgage Deeds
produced in Court, upon the Estate of the Defendant, amounting to    #
11000 l.$]
   [$The Council for the Plaintiff in their Reply urged, That the    #
Damage ought not to be
calculated from the Time the Fact was committed to his Lady's Death, #
the Consideration of
the Damages ought to regard Futurity; that when once the Ties of     #
mutual Love is broken,
it can never be repaired; and if they had not been detected they     #
might have gone on with
Impunity. As to the Plea made Use of, that his Estate is not capable #
of paying large
Damages, a Case was mentioned of a Footman for the like Crime, who   #
was fined 5000 l. for
it is but reasonable, if a Person destroys the Happiness of another  #
his Happiness ought to be
disturbed as long as he lives. There is a standing Law against       #
Adultery, the Adulteress and
Adulterer too is to be put to Death. There is nothing here can make  #
Satisfaction but a
Pecuniary Punishment.$]

   [$Upon the whole the Jury withdrew, and after a short Stay        #
brought in their Verdict for
the Plaintiff, 10000 (^l.^) Damages.$]
