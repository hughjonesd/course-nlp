and against your cony-catching Rascalls, (^Bardolf, Nym^) ,
and (^Pistoll^) .
   [$ (^Bar.^) $] You Banbery Cheese.
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I, it is no matter.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] How now, (^Mephostophilus^) ?
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I, it is no matter.
   [$ (^Nym.^) $] Slice, I say; (^ (\pauca, pauca\) ^) : Slice,      #
that's my
humor.
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] Where's (^Simple^) my man? can you tell, Cosen?
   [$ (^Eua.^) $] Peace, I pray you: now let vs vnderstand: there
is three Vmpires in this matter, as I vnderstand; that is,
Master (^Page^) ( (\fidelicet\) Master (^Page^) ,) & there is my     #
selfe,
( (\fidelicet\) my selfe) and the three party is (lastly, and
finally) mine Host of the Gater.

note-booke, and we wil afterwards orke vpon the cause,
with as great discreetly as we can.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] (^Pistoll.^)
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] He heares with eares.
   [$ (^Euan.^) $] The Teuill and his Tam: what phrase is this?
he heares with eare? why, it is affectations.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] (^Pistoll^) , did you picke M. (^Slenders^) purse?
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I, by these gloues did hee, or I would I might
neuer come in mine owne great chamber againe else, of
seauen groates in mill-sixpences, and two (^Edward^)
Shouelboords, that cost me two shilling and two pence a
peece of (^Yead Miller^) : by these gloues.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Is this true, (^Pistoll^) ?
   [$ (^Euan.^) $] No, it is false, if it is a picke-purse.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Ha, thou mountaine Forreyner: Sir (^Iohn^) , and
Master mine, I combat challenge of this Latine Bilboe:
word of deniall in thy (^ (\labras\) ^) here; word of denial; froth,
and scum thou liest.
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] By these gloues, then 'twas he.
   [$ (^Nym.^) $] Be auis'd sir, and passe good humours: I will
say marry trap with you, if you runne the nut-hooks
humor on me, that is the very note of it.
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] By this hat, then he in the red face had it: for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made
me drunke, yet I am not altogether an asse.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] What say you (^Scarlet^) , and (^Iohn^) ?
   [$ (^Bar.^) $] Why sir, (for my part) I say the Gentleman had
drunke himselfe out of his fiue sentences.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] It is his fiue sences: fie, what the ignorance is.
   [$ (^Bar.^) $] And being fap, sir, was (as they say) casheerd: and
so conclusions past the Car-eires.
<P 40C2>
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I, you spake in Latten then to: but 'tis no
matter; Ile nere be drunk whilst I liue againe, but in honest,
ciuill, godly company for this tricke: if I be drunke, Ile
be drunke with those that haue the feare of God, and not
with drunken knaues.
   [$ (^Euan.^) $] So got-udge me, that is a vertuous                #
[^SOURCE TEXT: vertuons^] minde.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] You heare all these matters deni'd, Gentlemen;
you heare it.
   [$ (^M=r=. Page.^) $] Nay daughter, carry the wine in, wee'll
drinke within.
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] Oh heauen: This is Mistresse (^Anne Page^) .
   [$ (^M=r=. Page.^) $] How now Mistris (^Ford^) ?
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] (^Mistris Ford^) , by my troth you are very wel met:
by your leaue good Mistris.
   [$ (^M=r=. Page.^) $] Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome: come,
we haue a hot Venison pasty to dinner; Come
gentlemen, I hope we shall drinke downe all vnkindnesse.
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I had rather then forty shillings I had my booke
of Songs and Sonnets heere: How now (^Simple^) , where
haue you beene? I must wait on my selfe, must I? you
haue not the booke of Riddles about you, haue you?
   [$ (^Sim.^) $] Booke of Riddles? why did you not lend it to
(^Alice Short-cake^) vpon Alhallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas.
   [$ (^Shal.^) $] Come Coz, come Coz, we stay for you: a word
with you Coz: marry this, Coz: there is as 'twere a
tender, a kinde of tender, made a farre-off by Sir (^Hugh^) here:
doe you vnderstand me?
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I Sir, you shall finde me reasonable; if it be so,
I shall doe that that is reason.
   [$ (^Shal.^) $] Nay, but vnderstand me.
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] So I doe Sir.
   [$ (^Euan.^) $] Giue eare to his motions; (M=r=. (^Slender^) ) I  #
will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] Nay, I will doe as my Cozen (^Shallow^) saies: I
pray you pardon me, he's a Iustice of Peace in his
Countrie, simple though I stand here.
   [$ (^Euan.^) $] But that is not the question: the question is
concerning your marriage.
   [$ (^Shal.^) $] I, there's the point Sir.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] Marry is it: the very point of it, to Mi.           #
(^An Page^) .
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] Why if it be so; I will marry her vpon any
reasonable demands.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] But can you affection the 'o-man, let vs command
to know that of your mouth, or of your lips: for diuers
Philosophers hold, that the lips is parcell of the mouth:
therfore precisely, ca~ you carry your good wil to y=e= maid?
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] Cosen (^Abraham Slender^) , can you loue her?
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I hope sir, I will do as it shall become one that 
would doe reason.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] Nay, got's Lords, and his Ladies, you must speake
possitable, if you can carry-her your desires towards her.
   [$ (^Shal.^) $] That you must:
Will you, (vpon good dowry) marry her?
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I will doe a greater thing then that, vpon your
request (Cosen) in any reason.
   [$ (^Shal.^) $] Nay conceiue me, conceiue mee, (sweet Coz):
what I doe is to pleasure you (Coz:) can you loue the 
maid?
   [$ (^Slen.^) $] I will marry her (Sir) at your request; but if
there bee no great loue in the beginning, yet Heauen
may decrease it vpon better acquaintance, when wee
are married, and haue more occasion to know one
another: I hope vpon familiarity will grow more content:
but if you say mary-her, I will mary-her, that I am freely 
dissolued, and dissolutely.
<P 41C1>
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] It is a fery discetion-answere; saue the fall is in
the'ord, dissolutely; the ort is (according to our 
meaning) resolutely: his meaning is good.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] I: I thinke my Cosen meant well.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] I, or else I would I might be hang'd (la.)
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] Here comes faire Mistris (^Anne^) ; would I were 
yong for your sake, Mistris (^Anne^) .
   [$ (^An.^) $] The dinner is on the Table, my Father desires
your worships company.
   [$ (^Sh.^) $] I will wait on him, (faire Mistris (^Anne^) .)
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] Od's plessed-wil: I wil not be abse~ce at the grace.
   [$ (^An.^) $] Wil't please your worship to come in, Sir?
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] No, I thank you forsooth, hartely; I am very well.
   [$ (^An.^) $] The dinner attends you, Sir.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] I am not a-hungry, I thanke you, forsooth: goe,
Sirha, for all you are my man, goe wait vpon my Cosen
(^Shallow^) : a Iustice of peace sometime may be beholding
to his friend, for a Man; I keepe but three Men, and a 
Boy yet, till my Mother be dead: but what though, yet
I liue like a poore Gentleman borne.
   [$ (^An.^) $] I may not goe in without your worship: they
will not sit till you come.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] I'faith, ile eate nothing: I thanke you as much as
though I did.
   [$ (^An.^) $] I pray you Sir walke in.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] I had rather walke here (I thanke you) I bruiz'd
my shin th'other day, with playing at Sword and
Dagger with a Master of Fence (three veneys for a dish of
stew'd Prunes) and by my troth, I cannot abide the smell
of hot meate since. Why doe your dogs barke so? be
there Beares ith' Towne?
   [$ (^An.^) $] I thinke there are, Sir, I heard them talk'd of.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] I loue the sport well, but I shall as soone quarrell
at it, as any man in (^England^) : you are afraid if you see the 
Beare loose, are you not?
   [$ (^An.^) $] I indeede Sir.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] That's meate and drinke to me now: I haue seene
(^Saskerson^) loose, twenty times, and haue taken him by the
Chaine: but (I warrant you) the women haue so cride
and shrekt at it, that it past: But women indeede, cannot
abide'em, they are very ill-fauour'd rough things.
   [$ (^Ma. Pa.^) $] Come, gentle M. (^Slender^) , come; we stay for #
you.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] Ile eate nothing, I thanke you Sir.
   [$ (^Ma. Pa.^) $] By cocke and pie, you shall not choose, Sir:
come, come.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] Nay, pray you lead the way.
   [$ (^Ma. Pa.^) $] Come on, Sir.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] Mistris (^Anne^) : your selfe shall goe first.
   [$ (^An.^) $] Not I Sir, pray you keepe on.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] Truely I will not goe first: truely-la: I will not
doe you that wrong.
   [$ (^An.^) $] I pray you Sir.
   [$ (^Sl.^) $] Ile rather be vnmannerly, then troublesome: you
doe your selfe wrong indeede-la. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]

[$ (^Enter Euans, and Simple.^) $]
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] Go your waies, and aske of Doctor (^Caius^) house,
which is the way; and there dwels one Mistris (^Quickly^) ; 
which is in the manner of his Nurse; or his dry-Nurse; or
his Cooke; or his Laundry; his Washer, and his Ringer.
   [$ (^Si.^) $] Well Sir.
<P 41C2>
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] Nay, it is petter yet: giue her this letter; for it #
is
a'oman that altogeathers acquainta~ce with Mistris (^Anne
Page^) ; and the Letter is to desire, and require her to
solicite your Masters desires, to Mistris (^Anne Page^) : I pray 
you be gon: I will make an end of my dinner; ther's
Pippins and Cheese to come. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]

[$ (^Enter Falstaffe, Host, Bardolfe, Nym, Pistoll, Page.^) $]
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Mine (^Host^) of the (^Garter^) ?
   [$ (^Ho.^) $] What saies my Bully Rooke? speake schollerly,
and wisely.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Truely mine (^Host^) ; I must turne away some of my
followers.
   [$ (^Ho.^) $] Discard, (bully (^Hercules^) ) casheere; let them   #
wag;
trot, trot.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] I sit at ten pounds a weeke.
   [$ (^Ho.^) $] Thou'rt an Emperor ( (^Cesar, Keiser^) and          #
(^Pheazar^) )
I will entertaine (^Bardolfe^) : he shall draw; he shall tap; said
I well (bully (^Hector^) ?)
   [$ (^Fa.^) $] Doe so (good mine (^Host^) .
   [$ (^Ho.^) $] I haue spoke: let him follow: let me see thee froth,
and hue: I am at a word: follow.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] (^Bardolfe^) , follow him: a (^Tapster^) is a good #
trade:
an old Cloake, makes a new Ierkin: a wither'd 
Seruingman, a fresh Tapster: goe, adew.
   [$ (^Ba.^) $] It is a life that I haue desir'd: I will thriue.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] O base hungarian wight: wilt y=u= the spigot wield.
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] He was gotten in drink: is not the humor co~ceited?
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] I am glad I am so acquit of this Tinderbox: his
Thefts were too open: his filching was like an vnskilfull
Singer, he kept not time.
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] The good humor is to steale at a minutes rest.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Conuay: the wife it call: Steale? foh: a fico for
the phrase.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Well sirs, I am almost out at heeles.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Why then let Kibes ensue.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] There is no remedy: I must conicatch, I must shift.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Yong Rauens must haue foode.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Which of you know (^Ford^) of this Towne?
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] My honest Lads, I will tell you what I am about.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Two yards, and more.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] No quips now (^Pistoll^) : (Indeede I am in the    #
waste
two yards about: but I am now about no waste: I am
about thrift) briefely: I doe meane to make loue to (^Fords^)
wife: I spie entertainment in her: shee discourses: shee
carues: she giues the leere of inuitation: I can construe
the action of her familier stile, & the hardest voice of her
behauior (to be english'd rightly) is, (^I am Sir Iohn Falstafs^) .
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] He hath studied her will; and translated her will:
out of honesty, into English.
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] The Anchor is deepe: will that humor passe?
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Now, the report goes, she has all the rule of her
husbands Purse: he hath a legend of Angels.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] As many diuels entertaine: and to her Boy say I.
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] The humor rises: it is good: humor me the angels.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] I haue writ me here a letter to her: & here
another to (^Pages^) wife, who euen now gaue mee good eyes
too; examind my parts with most iudicious illiads: 
sometimes the beame of her view, guilded my foote: 
sometimes my portly belly.
<P 42C1>
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Then did the Sun on dung-hill shine.
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] I thanke thee for that humour.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] O she did so course o're my exteriors with such
a greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye, did seeme
to scorch me vp like a burning-glasse: here's another
letter to her: She beares the Purse too: She is a Region
in (^Guiana^) : all gold, and bountie: I will be Cheaters to
them both, and they shall be Exchequers to mee: they 
shall be my East and West Indies, and I will trade to
them both: Goe, beare thou this Letter to Mistris (^Page^) ;
and thou this to Mistris (^Ford^) : we will thriue (Lads) we
will thriue.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Shall I Sir (^Pandarus^) of (^Troy^) become,
And by my side weare Steele? then Lucifer take all.
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] I will run no base humor: here take the
humor-Letter; I will keepe the hauior of reputation.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Hold Sirha, beare you these Letters tightly,
Saile like my Pinnasse to these golden shores.
Rogues, hence, auaunt, vanish like haile-stones; goe,
Trudge; plod away ith'hoofe: seeke shelter, packe:
(^Falstaffe ^) will learne the honor of the age,
French-thrift, you Rogues, my selfe, and skirted (^Page^) .
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Let Vultures gripe thy guts: for gourd, and
Fullam holds: & high and low beguiles the rich & poore,
Tester ile haue in pouch when thou shalt lacke,
Base (^Phrygian^) Turke.
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] I haue opperations,
Which be humors of reuenge.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Wilt thou reuenge?
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] By Welkin, and her Star.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] With wit, or Steele?
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] With both the humors, I:
I will discusse the humour of this Loue to (^Ford^) .
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] And I to (^Page^) shall eke vnfold
How (^Falstaffe^) (varlet vile)
His Doue will proue; his gold will hold,
And his soft couch defile.
   [$ (^Ni.^) $] My humour shall not coole: I will incense (^Ford^)
to deale with poyson: I will possesse him with 
yallownesse, for the reuolt of mine is dangerous: that is my
true humour.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Thou art the (^Mars^) of (^Malecontents^) : I     #

Do's he lye at the Garter?

voyage toward my wife, I would turne her loose to him;
and what hee gets more of her, then sharpe words, let it
lye on my head.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] I doe not misdoubt my wife: but I would bee
loath to turne them together: a man may be too
confident: I would haue nothing lye on my head: I cannot
be thus satisfied.

Angels giuen me this morning, but I defie all Angels (in
any such sort, as they say) but in the way of honesty: and
I warrant you, they could neuer get her so much as sippe
on a cup with the prowdest of them all, and yet there has 
beene Earles: nay, (which is more) Pentioners, but I
warrant you all is one with her.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] But what saies shee to mee? be briefe my good
(^shee-Mercurie^) [^NO ITALICS FOR shee IN SOURCE TEXT^] .
   [$ (^Qui.^) $] Marry, she hath receiu'd your Letter: for the
which she thankes you a thousand times; and she giues
you to notifie, that her husband will be absence from his
house, betweene ten and eleuen.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Ten, and eleuen.
   [$ (^Qui.^) $] I, forsooth: and then you may come and see the
picture (she sayes) that you wot of: Master (^Ford^) her
husband will be from home: alas, the sweet woman leades
an ill life with him: hee's a very iealousie-man; she leads
a very frampold life with him, (good hart.)
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Ten, and eleuen.
<P 46C1>
Woman, commend me to her, I will not faile her.
   [$ (^Qui.^) $] Why, you say well: But I haue another 
messenger to your worship: Mistresse (^Page^) hath her heartie
commendations to you to: and let mee tell you in your
eare, shee's as fartuous a ciuill modest wife, and one (I
tell you) that will not misse you morning nor euening 
prayer, as any is in (^Windsor^) , who ere bee the other: and
shee bade me tell your worship, that her husband is
seldome from home, but she hopes there will come a time.
I neuer knew a woman so doate vpon a man; surely I
thinke you haue charmes, la: yes in truth.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Not I, I assure thee; setting the attraction of my
good parts aside, I haue no other charmes.
   [$ (^Qui.^) $] Blessing on your heart for't.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] But I pray thee tell me this: has (^Fords^) wife,  #
and
(^Pages^) wife acquainted each other, how they loue me?
   [$ (^Qui.^) $] That were a iest indeed: they haue not so little
grace I hope, that were a tricke indeed: But Mistris (^Page^)
would desire you to send her your little Page of al loues:
her husband has a maruellous infectio~ to the little Page:
and truely Master (^Page^) is an honest man: neuer a wife in
(^Windsor^) leades a better life then she do's: doe what shee
will, say what she will, take all, pay all, goe to bed when
she list, rise when she list, all is as she will: and truly she
deserues it; for if there be a kinde woman in (^Windsor^) , she
is one: you must send her your Page, no remedie.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Why, I will.
   [$ (^Qu.^) $] Nay, but doe so then, and looke you, hee may
come and goe betweene you both: and in any case haue
a nay-word, that you may know one anothers minde,
and the Boy neuer neede to vnderstand any thing; for
'tis not good that children should know any wickednes:
olde folkes you know, haue discretion, as they say, and
know the world.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Farethee-well, commend mee to them both:
there's my purse, I am yet thy debter: Boy, goe along 
with this woman, this newes distracts me.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] This Puncke is one of (^Cupids^) Carriers,
Clap on more sailes, pursue: vp with your fights:
Giue fire: she is my prize, or Ocean whelme them all.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Saist thou so (old (^Iacke^) ) go thy waies: Ile   #
make
more of thy olde body then I haue done: will they yet
looke after thee? wilt thou after the expence of so much
money, be now a gainer? good Body, I thanke thee: let
them say 'tis grossely done, so it bee fairely done, no
matter.
   [$ (^Bar.^) $] Sir (^Iohn^) , there's one Master (^Broome^) below #
would
faine speake with you, and be acquainted with you; and 
hath sent your worship a mornings draught of Sacke.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] (^Broome^) is his name?
   [$ (^Bar.^) $] I Sir.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Call him in: such (^Broomes^) are welcome to mee,
that ore'flowes such liquor: ah ha, Mistresse (^Ford^) and
Mistresse (^Page^) , haue I encompass'd you? goe to, (^ (\via\) ^) .
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] 'Blesse you sir.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] And you sir: would you speake with me?
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] I make bold, to presse, with so little 
preparation vpon you.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] You'r welcome, what's your will? giue vs leaue
Drawer.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Sir, I am a Gentleman that haue spent much,
my name is (^Broome^) .
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Good Master (^Broome^) , I desire more acquaintance
of you.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Good Sir (^Iohn^) , I sue for yours: not to charge
you, for I must let you vnderstand, I thinke my selfe in
<P 46C2>
better plight for a Lender, then you are: the which hath
something emboldned me to this vnseason'd intrusion:
for they say, if money goe before, all waies doe lye
open.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Money is a good Souldier (Sir) and will on.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Troth, and I haue a bag of money heere
troubles me: if you will helpe to beare it (Sir (^Iohn^) ) take all,
or halfe, for easing me of the carriage.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Sir, I know not how I may deserue to bee your
Porter.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] I will tell you sir, if you will giue mee the
hearing.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Speake (good Master (^Broome^) ) I shall be glad to
be your Seruant.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Sir, I heare you are a Scholler: (I will be briefe
with you) and you haue been a man long knowne to me,
though I had neuer so good means as desire, to make my
selfe acquainted with you. I shall discouer a thing to
you, wherein I must very much lay open mine owne 
imperfection: but (good Sir (^Iohn^) ) as you haue one eye 
vpon my follies, as you heare them vnfolded, turne another
into the Register of your owne, that I may passe with a
reproofe the easier, sith you your selfe know how easie it
is to be such an offender.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Very well Sir, proceed.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] There is a Gentlewoman in this Towne, her
husbands name is (^Ford^) .
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Well Sir.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] I haue long lou'd her, and I protest to you, 
bestowed much on her: followed her with a doating 
obseruance: Ingross'd opportunities to meete her: fee'd 
euery slight occasion that could but nigardly giue mee
sight of her: not only bought many presents to giue her,
but haue giuen largely to many, to know what shee
would haue giuen: briefly, I haue pursu'd her, as Loue
hath pursued mee, which hath beene on the wing of all
occasions: but whatsoeuer I haue merited, either in my
minde, or in my meanes, meede I am sure I haue receiued
none, vnlesse Experience be a Iewell, that I haue 
purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught mee to say
this,
   (^"Loue like a shadow flies, when substance Loue pursues,
     "Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.^)

   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Haue you receiu'd no promise of satisfaction at
her hands?
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Neuer.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Haue you importun'd her to such a purpose?
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Neuer.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Of what qualitie was your loue then?
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Like a fair house, built on another mans ground,
so that I haue lost my edifice, by mistaking the place,
where I erected it.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] To what purpose haue you vnfolded this to me?
   [$ (^For.^) $] When I haue told you that, I haue told you all:
Some say, that though she appeare honest to mee, yet in
other places shee enlargeth her mirth so farre, that there
is shrewd construction made of her. Now (Sir (^Iohn^) ) here
is the heart of my purpose: you are a gentleman of
excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great
admittance, authenticke in your place and person, generally
allow'd for your many war-like, court-like, and learned 
preparations.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] O Sir.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Beleeue it, for you know it: there is money,
spend it, spend it, spend more; spend all I haue, onely
<P 47C1>
giue me so much of your time in enchange of it, as to lay
an amiable siege to the honesty of this (^Fords^) wife: vse 
your Art of wooing; win her to consent to you: if any
man may, you may as soone as any.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection that I should win what you would enioy? 
Methinkes you prescribe to your selfe very preposterously.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] O, vnderstand my drift: she dwells so securely
on the excellency of her honor, that the folly of my soule
dares not present it selfe: shee is too bright to be look'd
against. Now, could I come to her with any detection
in my hand; my desires had instance and argument to
commend themselues, I could driue her then from the
ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage-vow,
and a thousand other her defences, which now are
too-too strongly embattaild against me: what say you too't,
Sir (^Iohn^) ?
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Master (^Broome^) , I will first make bold with your
money: next, giue mee your hand: and last, as I am a
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enioy (^Fords^) wife.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] O good Sir.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] I say you shall.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] Want no money (Sir (^Iohn^) ) you shall want none.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Want no (^Mistresse Ford^) (Master (^Broome^) )    #
you shall 
want none: I shall be with her (I may tell you) by her
owne appointment, euen as you came in to me, her
assistant, or goe-betweene, parted from me: I say I shall be
with her betweene ten and eleuen: for at that time the
iealious-rascally-knaue her husband will be forth: come
you to me at night, you shall know how I speed.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] I am blest in your acquaintance: do you know
(^Ford^) Sir?
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Hang him (poore Cuckoldly knaue) I know
him not: yet I wrong him to call him poore: They say
the iealous wittolly-knaue hath masses of money, for
the which his wife seemes to me well-fauourd: I will vse
her as the key of the Cuckoldly-rogues Coffer, & ther's
my haruest-home.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] I would you knew (^Ford^) , sir, that you might
auoid him, if you saw him.
   [$ (^Fal.^) $] Hang him, mechanicall-salt-butter rogue; I wil
stare him out of his wits: I will awe-him with my
cudgell: it shall hang like a Meteor ore the Cuckolds horns:
Master (^Broome^) , thou shalt know, I will predominate
ouer the pezant, and thou shalt lye with his wife. Come
to me soone at night: (^Ford's^) a knaue, and I will
aggrauate his stile: thou (Master (^Broome^) ) shalt know him for
knaue, and Cuckold. Come to me soone at night.
   [$ (^Ford.^) $] What a damn'd Epicurian-Rascall is this? my
heart is ready to cracke with impatience: who saies this
is improuident iealousie? my wife hath sent to him, the
howre is fixt, the match is made: would any man haue
thought this? see the hell of hauing a false woman: my
bed shall be abus'd, my Coffers ransack'd, my 
reputation gnawne at, and I shall not onely receiue this villanous 
wrong, but stand vnder the adoption of abhominable
termes, and by him that does mee this wrong: Termes,
names: (^Amaimon^) sounds well: (^Lucifer^) , well: (^Barbason^) ,
well: yet they are Diuels additions, the names of fiends:
But Cuckold, Wittoll, Cuckold? The Diuell himselfe
hath not such a name. (^Page^) is an Asse, a secure Asse; hee
will trust his wife, hee will not be iealous: I will rather 
trust a (^Fleming^) with my butter, Parson (^Hugh^) the
(^Welsh-man^) with my Cheese, an (^Irish-man^) with my 
Aqua-vitae-bottle, or a Theefe walke my ambling gelding, then
my wife with her selfe. Then she plots, then shee
<P 47C2>
ruminates [^SOURCE TEXT: rumiuates^] , then shee deuises: and what   #
they thinke in their
hearts they may effect; they will breake their hearts but
they will effect. Heauen bee prais'd for my iealousie:
eleuen o'clocke the howre, I will preuent this, detect
my wife, bee reueng'd on (^Falstaffe^) , and laugh at (^Page^) . I
will about it, better three houres too soone, then a
