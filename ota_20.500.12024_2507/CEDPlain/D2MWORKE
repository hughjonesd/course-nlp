[$ (^Enter Sword.^) $]

   [$ (^Sword.^) $] 

Nay (^Rapier^) , come foorth,
come forth I say, Ile giue
thee a crowne, though it
be but a crackt one: what
wilt not? art so hard to
be drawne forth (^Rapier^) ?
<P A3V>
[$ (^Enter Rapier.^) $]

   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] S'foot thou shalt know that (^Rapier^)
dares enter: nay (^Backe-Sword^) .

[$ (^Enter Dagger, he holds Rapiers 
hands behinde him.^) $]

   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Whose this behinde me?
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Tis (^Dagger^) sir; what will you
neuer leaue your quarrelling?
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Well (^Sword^) , (^Dagger^) hath
defended you a good many times; but tis no
matter, another time shall serue: shall I get
you out (^Sword^) alone, that I may haue you
(^Single-sword^) .
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Yes if youle be single (^Rapier^) too.
   [$ (^Dag.^) $] Nay (^Sword^) , put the (^Case^) of (^Rapiers^)
aside, that there were two of them, I hope
you were able to buckle with them.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Ile tell you what, if I goe into the
Field with him, hang (^Sword^) vp if I doe not
cut (^Rapiers^) poynts, and lash him when I haue
done: nay, you shall finde (^Sword^) mettle to
the very backe: 'sfoot, my teeth be an edge
at him.
   [$ (^Dag.^) $] If you offer but to thrust towards
<P A4R>
him (^Rapier^) , Ile strike you downe.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Hang him, I defie him base
Spaniard.
   [$ (^Rap.^) $] Defie me? sirrha (^Sword^) , (^Rapier^) spits
i'thy face: dar'st meete mee i'the fields,
crauenly Capon?
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Capon?
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] I Capon, so I say sir.
   [$ (^Dagg.^) $] Why any man may see that thou
art well caru'd (^Sword^) ; and yet mee thinks
that (^Rapier^) should not speake of that, for it's
an hundred to one if he be not gilt too.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Well (^Rapier^) , if thou goest into
the fields with me, Ile make a Capon of you
before I haue done with you, you shall nere
come home vncut Ile warrant you.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Nay, you shall finde (^Sword^) a 
notable Cutter.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] He a Cutter? alas he nere went
into the fields yet, but he was soundly hackt
before he came out
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Nere talke you of hacking, for
it's a hundred to one if you haue not the
(^Foyle-Rapier^) .
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] 'Sfoot if you be so (^Short-Sword^) ,
(^Rapier^) nere feares you: come a long.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Nay nere goe, for if you doe,
<P A4V>
Ile sende one after you, which shall scowre
you both. The (^Cutler^) can doe it. I haue seene
him handle you both brauely.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] The (^Cutler^) , Alas wee are the best
Friends hee has, and if it were not for vs,
the (^Cutler^) might soone shut vp his shoppe.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Alas (^Sword^) , you need not talke
of his shutting vp of Shoppe, and if it had
not beene for him, you had broken by this
time (^Sword^) , Nay, nere talke: For you know
hee can holde your nose to the Grind-stone,
when hee list.
   And as for you (^Rapier^) , you knowe hee
brought you vp first, and if you had stayed
with him still, it might haue bene better for 
you.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Better for mee? Alas hee knewe
not how to vse mee.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Hee vsde you too well indeede:
for when you were with him he furnisht you
with Siler and euery thing, but now you are
worne out of all fashion. You are euen like
a Lapwing, you are no sooner Hatcht
(^Rapier^) , but you runne abroade presently from
him.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Yet I scorne to runne away from
him.
<P B1R>
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] But it were more wisedome then
to stand: For the (^Cutler^) is a man as well
Armed as any man I knowe, and has as good
skill ins weapons.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Ha (^Sworde^) , is the winde in that
Doore? Faith nowe I see which waye you
stand bent (^Sworde^) , you had rather sleepe 
in a whole skinne, then goe into the Fields
to trye your selfe.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Syr, (^Sword^) has bene proou'd
before now, and yet heele prooue himselfe
againe with you, if you dare follow him.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Doe you heare (^Sworde^) ? If you
goe, looke for (^Dagger^) at your backs
presentlie; For I am a Iustice of Peace, and am
sworne to keepe and defend the Peace.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Syr, wee will fight, and doe you
take it in (^Dudgeon^) (^Dagger^) if you please: if
you once offer to hinder vs, Ile so Pummell
you (^Dagger^) , that you were neuer better
Pummeld in your life; And howsoeuer,
I hope theres Lawe against you as well as
others, and (^Rapier^) can put vp a (^Case^) against
you.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Alas I care not if you were both
Plaintifes against mee, you shall finde
(^Dagger^) your Defendant Ile warrant you:
<P B1V>
I, and if neede bee, I could put vp an Action
of Batterie against you.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] What talke you of Law? (^Sword^)
scornes to haue any other Law then (^Martiall^)
law, and that vpon you (^Rapier^) .
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Away (^Sworde^) , the Time was 
indeed when thou wast a notable 
Swash-buckler, but now thou art growne olde (^Sword^) .
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] I, you doe well, to excuse his
Cowardise.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Why Sir, tis well knowne that
(^Sword^) has flourisht in his dayes.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Flourisht? yfaith Syr I, I haue
seene (^Sword^) hang with nothing but Scarffes
ere now.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] With Scarffes? with a Halter, if
he had beene well seru'de, For hees a
notable Theefe. [$ (^Dagger.^) $] A Theefe?
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] I, a Thiefe.
Did you nere heare of (^Cutting-Dicke^) , this is
the very same man.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Nay (^Rapier^) , nere hit (^Sword^) ith
teeth with that: for you know you were both
Indited for treason before now, and were in
danger to be hangd, and drawn too, and had
escapt well if you had not bene quarterd.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] [^SPEAKER IDENTIFICATION SUPPLIED HERE IS        #
MISSING IN SOURCE TEXT.^] (^Sword^) I hope knows how to keep his     #
(^quarters^) .
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] You are a craftie (^Foxe^) (^Sword^) : It
<P B2R>
were well if you knewe howe to keepe your
friendship too, for Gentlemen and Friendes
should not fall out.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] (^Rapier^) a Gentleman?
   [$ (^Rap.^) $] A Gentleman? and has Armes.
   [$ (^Dag.^) $] But mee thinkes (^Sworde^) by the very
sounding of his Name should bee the better 
Gentleman, and has the better Armes too:
for if the truth were well knowne, (^Rapier^) hath
but one arme.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] (^Sword^) beare Armes? Hees a base
companion. Alas I haue knowne you beare a 
Basket (^Sword^) .
   [$ (^Dag.^) $] If you looke ith (^booke of Armorie^) , Ile
warrant you, you shall finde (^Sworde^) of more
antiquitie then you (^Rapier^) : Hee deriues his
Pedigree from (^Morglay, Beuis of 
South-hamptons sword^) ; and that from S. (^George his sword^) , 
that killd the Draggon.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] I, (^the draggon in Sussex^) , the other
day: But Ile warrant you (^Rapiers^) of as good
a blood as hee for his hart.
   [$ (^Dag.^) $] Byth masse, I thinke indeed, you are
both wel sanguind. Your both of one blood,
only thers this difference, that (^sword^) coms of
the elder brother, (^& you Rapier^) of the yo~ger.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] And oftentimes the younger
brother prooues the better Souldier.
<P B2V>
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Nay, (^Dagger^) will defende you
both for good Souldiers.
   [$ (^Sworde.^) $] (^Rapier^) a Souldier? When did
you ere knowe (^Rapier^) fight a Battell?
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Yes (^Rapier^) is a Souldier, and a
Man as well Armed at all poyntes as anie
one.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] No, no, its (^Sworde^) that's the
notable Souldier; Why, theres none of all you
Captaines could doe anie thing in Warre
without him.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] I hope (^Rapier^) hath not beene at
Fencing-Schoole all this while for nothing.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Alas there's none (^Maister of
Defence^) but (^Dagger^) : But yet if you speake of
Souldiers, the'rs Bow, Bill, and Gunne, worth
twenty such as wee are.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Indeed they say that Bow has bin
an olde Souldier.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Yet hees not fit for a Souldier,
any man may bende him as hee list.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] And as for Bow-string, I dare
vndertake to whip him my selfe.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Then let mee alone to tickle (^Bowes^)
ownes nocke yfaith.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] But what say you to (^Bill^) ? hees a
notable sturdy villaine.
<P B3R>
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] (^Bill^) , Ile pay him soundly, if ere
I reach him.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Its more then you can doe, Ime
affraide; For (^Bill's^) a Tall-fellow ons hands,
and will quickly be Wood: and then theres
(^Gunne^) , such another Bouncing-fellow too.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] (^Gunne^) , Alas hees No-body: any
little Boy will make him roare.
   I haue made him goe off 'oth Fieldes, a
good many times my selfe.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Well, is (^Gunne^) No-bodie? Ime
sure heel giue some blowes sometimes.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Its' nere but when (^Powder^)
ouercharges him, then indeed heel be somewhat
hote oth matter.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] I think that (^Powder^) is a vile
bragger, he doth nothing but cracke.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Faith I knowe not what
Souldier hee is, but they say, Hees an excellent
pollitician.
   [$ (^Rapier,^) $] Hee a Pollitician?
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Why, hee has an excellent wit?
   [$ (^Sword,^) $] Pish, Its nothing but a flash.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Ime sure I can remember since
he was a Parlement-man.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Hee a Parlement-man: For what
Shyre?
<P B3V>
   [$ (^Dag.^) $] Nay ber-lady, it was for the whole
Countrey.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] I wonder they should chuse him:
Why he does euery thing on the sudden.
   [$ (^Dag.^) $] Oh he plottes shrevvdly. If they had
not look't too it, Hee had vndermined the
vvhole parlement-house.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] I but hees No-body now-adayes,
Hees blovvne vp long agoe.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Well, if eyther you, or any body
else shuld meete with Povvder, yet its a
hundred to one, if he meete not vvith his match.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Nay, you should let him alone
(^Dagger^) , and you should see that (^Swords'^) as
notable a bragger as Povvder. He thinks hee
shall nere be matcht too: but hee shall, and
ouer-matcht too, by (^Rapier^) ; I vvarrant him.
Come (^Sworde^) , after your long Parley, Dare
you goe into the Fieldes?
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Dare I? You shall soone see that:
Goe, and Ile follovv you.
   [$ (^Dag.^) $] Well saide, desperate (^Dicke^) . (^Sword^) ,
You may be asham'd to offer it. You knovve
you are tvvo-handed-Sworde [^SOURCE TEXT HAS Sworde IN ITALICS^] ,   #
and (^Rapier^) has
but one hand (vnlesse I helpe him) to do any
good vvithall, and yet youde haue him go
into the Fieldes vvith you. Come, theres
neyther of you shall goe. Doe not you knovve
<P B4R>
that Duells are put downe?
   Youle bee bound to'th Peace euer
heereafter, if you strike but one stroke. Therefore
you had best let me decide your controuersie
for you.
   [$ (^Sword.^) $] Why, you are a backe-Friend to
vs both (^Dagger^) .
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Nay, you knowe Ime equally 
allyed to you both, and therefore shall proue
an impartiall Iudge: How say you, will you
be rulde by me?
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Nay let him choose, (^Rapiers^) at a
good poynt, whether he will or no.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Why are [^SOURCE TEXT: are are^] you so long    #
(^Sword^)
before you speake?
   [$ (^Sworde.^) $] Are duells put downe? Then I
am forc'de to be Friends: Speake then.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Then in briefe it shall bee thus.
(^Sworde^) , you shall beare Chiefe force ith
Campe, and be made Generall of the Field,
to beare sway euery where. As for you
(^Rapier^) , since Duells are put downe, you shall
liue quietly and peaceablie heere 'ith Court,
and goe euery day in Veluet: You shall be
Frendes with euerie one, and bee on euery
ones side, that if occasion serue, and (^Sworde^)
be absent, so that matters are driue~ to a push,
<P B4V>
(^Rapier^) shall be the onely man to performe a
Combate: And I my selfe will backe you
both, as occasion shall serue.
   How say yee, are yee content?
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] Wee are.
   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] Then goe before to my House,
to the (^Dagger^) in (^Cheape^) : and there weele
conclude all.
   [$ (^Rapier.^) $] A (^Long-Sword^) .
[$ (^ (\Exeunt\) , Sworde^) and (^Rapier^) .$] 

   [$ (^Dagger.^) $] 
(^Our weapons drawne, and yet no hurt yee finde,
Did Dagger then defend vnto your minde?
Hee that defended others not long sence,
At last hee dares not stand ins owne defence;
But this hee hopes, with you it will suffize,
To craue a pardon for a Schollers Prize.^)
