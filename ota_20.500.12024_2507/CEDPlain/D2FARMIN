[^---^] mistresse [$ (sayes (^Sotto^) ) $] I will not say 
welcome, because you come ill to him that would bee alone, 
<P A3V>
but since you are come, looke for such entertainement as my 
folly fits you with, that is, sharp sauce with bitter dyet, no 
sweetnes at al, for that were to mingle your pils with sugar, 
no, I am all one, Winter in the head, and frost in the foot, no 
Summer in me but in my smiles, and that as soone gone 
as smiles, the bauble I play with, is mens estates, which I 
so tumble from hand to hand, that weary with it I see 
(gluttingly and grieuedly, yet mingled with smiles too) in my 
glasse prospectiue, what shall become of it: [$the world, 
curling her locks with her fingers, and anone scratching her 
braine with her itching pin, as one little regarding                 #
[^SOURCE TEXT: regardiug^] answeres$] 
what then: marry [$sayes (^Hodge^) $] ile show thee. See world 
in whose bosome euer hath abundance beene powred, what 
thy imps of impietie bee, for as they (I) all for the most part, 
as these which I will present to thee in my glasse prospectiue, 
mark them well, and see what thou breedest in thy 
wantonnesse, sixe Children like thee, not the Father that begat them, 
where were they nursed, in folly? fed with the flottin milke 
of nicetie and wantonnesse [^SOURCE TEXT: wattonnesse^] , curdled in #
thy wombe of water 
and bloud, vnseasoned, because thy mother bearing temper 
was euer vntrue, farre from the rellish of right breede, and it 
is hard that the taste of one Apple should distaste the whole 
lumpe of this defused Chaios, but marke me and my glasse, 
see into some (and in them thy selfe) whom I haue discride, or
describde these sixe parts of folly in thee, thou shalt see them 
as cleare as day, how mistie thy clouds be, and what 
rancknesse raines from them. 
[^THE WORLD IS DESCRIBED.^]

   [$The world ready to disgorge at so homely a present, askt 
if it were possible such breathde hers to commaund,$] oh [$saith

[$ (^Iack Oates^) sitting at Cardes all alone, was dealing to 
himselfe at Vide ruffe (for that was the game he ioyed 
in) and as he spide a Knaue:$] Ah knaue art there, [$quoth he:
When he spide a King,$] King by your leaue, [$quoth he: if hee 
spied a Queene$] Queene (^Richard^) art come, [$quoth he: and 
would kneele downe and bid God blesse her Maiestie 
(meaning indeede the then Queene, whom he heard (^Sir William
Hollis^) his Maister so much to pray for: But heere is the Jest,
(^Iack^) as I say, being at Cardes all alone, spying a Knaue         #
[^SOURCE TEXT: Knane^] , 
and saying,$] Ah Knaue art there: [$A simple Seruingman 
being in the Hall waighting his maisters comming, walking
by, & hearing him say so, thought he had called him Knaue, 
tooke the matter in dudgin, and miscalled the Foole: another
Seruingman more foolish then both, took (^Iacks^) part, so that in 
short time they two fell together by the eares: who being 
parted, (^Iack Oates^) giues them each one a hand, and so takes 
them into the Buttry to drinke: the Knight comes in, seeing 
the Hall not yet quiet, askt the mateer: (^Iack^) comes,$] Ile tell 
thee (^Willy^) , [$quoth hee:$] As I was a playing at Cardes, one 
seeing I wonne all I playd for, would needes haue the Knaue 
from mee, which as very a Knaue as hee seeing, would needs 
beare him Knaue for company: so to bid them both welcome 
to thy house, I haue bin to intreat the Knaue thy Butler to 
make them drinke. I [$sayes Sir (^William^) ,$] and you like a knaue 
made them fall out. I [$answered (^Iack^) ,$] and your drinke Sir 
knaue made them friends. [$Sir (^William^) laughing, departed.$]
[^JACK PREPARES TO MEET A NOBLEMAN VISITING SIR WILLIAM'S HOUSE.^]

[^---^] [$ (^Iack Oates^) seeing him kisse his Ladie, 
on the sodaine giues the Earle a sound box on the eare,$] knaue 
[$ (quoth he) $] kisse Sir (^Willies^) wife? [$the good Knight       #
amazed at 
this, caused him to be whipt: but the kinde Noble man 
knowing simplicitie the ground of his errour, would not 
suffer it, but putting it vp, left him and entred the house. (^Iack^)
seeing they were sad, and he had done amisse, had this wit in
simplicitie to shadow it: he comes after and askt the Earle 
wher his hand was?$] Here [$ (quoth he) with that he shakes him 
by it, and sayes,$] I mistooke it before, knowing not your eare 
from your hand being so like one another: [^---^]
[^JACK IS NOW WHIPPED. CHRISTMAS COMES.^] 
[^...^] [$One time being very melancholy, the 
Knight to rouse him vp, saide,$] hence foole, Ile haue another 
foole, thou shalt dwell no longer with me: [$ (^Iack^) to this 
answered little, though indeede ye could not anger him worse:
A Gentleman at the boord answers,$] if it please you sir Ile 
bring ye another foole soone: I pray ye do [$ (quoth the knight) $]
and he shall bee welcome. [^...^]

   [$Sir (^William^) not knowing how to amend the matter, 
caused the Piper to be carried to bed, who was very ill: and
said$] I would now giue a gold noble for a foole indeede to 
anger him throughly: [$one of the Minstrels whispers a 
Gentleman in the eare, and said, if it pleased him hee would, 
whereat the Gentleman laught: the Knight demaunded the reason 
of his laughing,$] I pray you tell mee [$ (quoth hee) for laughing 
could neuer come in a better time,$] the foole hath madded me.
If it please you [$ (sayes the Gentleman) $] here is a good fellow 
will goe and attire him in one of his coates, and can in all 
poynts behaue himselfe naturally like such a one: it is good 
[$ (sayes the Knight) $] and I prethee good fellow about it, and one 
goe call (^Iack Oates^) hether, that wee may hold him with talk 
in the meane time.
[^THE MINSTREL PUTS ON A ZEALOUS PERFORMANCE AND BREAKS HIS
FIDDLE.^]
<P B2R>
   [$In comes (^Iack Oates^) and (being merry) told the knight 
and the rest, that a Country-wench in the Hall had eaten 
Garlicke and there was seauenteene men poysoned with 
kissing her: for it was his vse to iest thus: by and by 
comes in a Messenger (one of the Knights men) to tell 
him that such a Gentleman had sent his foole to dwell with 
him.$] Hee is welcome [$sayes the Knight,$] for I am weary of 
this foole, goe bid him come in, (^Iack^) bid him welcome: 
[$they all laught to see (^Iacks^) colour come and goe, like a wise 
man ready to make a good end:$] What say you to this [$saies 
the Knight?$] not one word [$sayes (^Iack^) . They tinged with 
a knife at the bottome of a glasse, as toulling the bell for the
Foole, who was speechlesse and would dye (then which, 
nothing could more anger him) but now the thought of the 
new come Foole so much mooued him, that hee was as dead 
as a doore nayle: standing on tip-toe looking toward the 
doore to behold his ariuall, that he would put his nose out 
of ioynt.$]
[^JACK ATTACKS THE "ARTIFICIAL" FOOL.^] 
[^...^] [$The Pyper and the 
Minstrel being in bed together, one cryed O his backe and face: 
the other, O his face and eye: the one cryed O his Pype: 
the other, O his fiddle.$] [^...^] 
<P B2V>
[^THE LADY ORDERS A QUINCE PIE; QUINCES ARE BROUGHT AT GREAT EFFORT
AND EXPENSE.^]
[^...^] [$The 
Knight asking his Lady for his pie, she told him with much 
adoe she had preuailed, but with no little paines in seeking 
Quinces, for she was faine to buy them ready preserued, & 
to make a vertue of necessity that way. Sir (^William^) seeing  
<P B3R>
it was so, said it should bee as well eaten, and sent for his 
Friends, Gentlemen, and others of no small account. 
There was other great cheare prouided to furnish vp 
this sumptuous Feast, and as he inuited them, hee tolde 
them it was a Quince Pie, which he would haue eaten: 
the day drew on, and the Gentiles were come, and all 
was in a redinesse, and still (^Iack^) forgat not the Pie, but 
stood faintly sicke, and refused his meate: the Knight sory 
that his best dish fayled him, made no small account of his 
well fare, askt him:$] (^Iack^) , [$sayes hee,$] Where lyes thy paine? 
In my mouth [$sayes hee (meaning indeede his mouth hung 
for the Quince Pie) a Barber was sent for from a Market 
towne hard by, who searcht his mouth and could finde no 
cause of paine: but sir (^William^) thinking the Foole wanted 
wit to tell his griefe (though not wit to play the theefe) bad 
the Barber depart, asking (^Iack^) what hee would eate? He 
sayd$] nothing: [$What he would drinke? He said$] nothing: 
[$which made sir (^William^) doubt much of his health, refusing 
his liquour, when it was vsually his practise, and the Knight 
ioyed in it too: askt him if he would lie downe? still 
answering no; but would stand by the Kitchin fire. The Knight, 
that knew he neuer came there but he did some exployte, 
forgetting that, led him by the hand (so much he made of 
him) and bad the Cooke see he wanted nothing. (^Iack^) 
standing still, groand & sayd: If he dyed, he would forgiue all 
the world but the Cooke.$] Hang Foole [$ (sayes the Cooke) $] I 
care not for thee, die to morrow if thou wilt, [$and so 
followed his busines. They knockt to the Dresser, and the dinner
went vp: (^Iack^) had a sheepes eye in the Ouen: anone the 
second course came, the Pie was drawne, set by, & among 
other backt meates was to be sent vp, but wanting Suger, 
stept aside to the spicerie to fetch it, & (^Iack^) in the meane 
time catcheth the Pie and claps it vnder his coate, and so 
runs through the Hall into the Yard, where was a broad 
Moate, and as he ran, the hot Pie burned his belly:$] I [$sayes 
(^Iack^) $] are yee so hot Sir (^Willies^) Pie. Ile quence ye anone  #
sir 
<P B3V>
(^Willies^) Pie [$sayes he, and straight very subtilly leapes 
into the Moate vp to the arme pits, and there stood eating 
the Pie. The Cooke comes in, misses the Pie, withal misses 
(^Iack^) , cryes out, the Pie: sir (^Williams^) Pie was gone, the 
Author of that feast was gone, and they all were vndone: 
a hurly burly went through the house, and one comes and 
whispers the Lady with the newes: she tels sir (^William^)
how (^Iack Oates^) had stolen the Pie. (^Iack^) was searcht for, 
and anon found in the Moate. It was told the Knight 
where the Foole was eating it:$] Gentlemen [$ (quoth he) $] we 
are disfurnished of our feast, for (^Iack^) my Foole is in my 
Moate vp to the arme-pits eating of the Pie. [$They laught 
and ran to the windows to see the iest: there they might see 
(^Iack^) eate, the Cooke call, the people hallow, but to no 
purpose: (^Iack^) fed & feeding greedily (more to anger the Cooke,
then disapoint sir (^William^) ) euer as hee burnt his mouth 
with hast, dipt the Pie in the water to coole it:$] O [$sayes the
Cooke$] it is Sir (^Williams^) owne Pie sirra: O [$sayes (^Iack^) $]
hang thee and Sir (^Willy^) too I care not, it is mine now: saue 
Sir (^William^) some [$sayes one,$] saue my Lady some [$sayes 
another:$] by (^Iames^) not a bit [$sayes (^Iack^) , and eate vp     #
all, to
the wonder of the beholders, who neuer knew him eate so 
much before, but drincke ten times more: at length out 
comes (^Iack^) dropping dry, and goes to get fire to dry him: the 
Knight and the rest all laught a good at the iest, not 
knowing how to amend it. Sir (^William^) sends for the Cooke, who 
came vp with a sorrowfull hart, and lamentably 
complayning, said it was the Knights fault for placing him in the
Kitchin, where he neuer was but hee did like villany. The 
Knight not satisfied with the Cookes answere, presently 
discharges him of his seruice, and sent him to liue else where:$] 
goe [$sayes he,$] trusse vp your trinkets and be gone, [$the Cooke
seeing no remedy departed.$]
   [$ (^Iack^) being dry vp he comes, and knowing he had 
offended, tels a iest (for it was his manner so to doe) how a yong 
man brake his codpeece point, and let all bee seene that God  
<P B4R>
sent him, or such fooleries, but that was not enough, and to 
chide him was to make of things worse then twas, and to 
no purpose neither. Sir (^William^) demaunded why hee eate 
the Pye:$] because I had a stomacke [$sayes (^Iack^) :$] would 
nought else serue [$sayes the Knight$] but my Pye? No (^Willy^) 
[$sayes he$] thou would not be angry then, and the Cooke had 
not beene turnd away: but all is well thou art rich inough 
to buy more. [$The Knight perceiuing the fooles enuie, sent 
for the Cooke, and did let him enioy his place againe.$] [^...^]
[^THE COOK IS NOT PLEASED THAT THE PIE IS GONE, BUT AT LEAST REMAINS
IN SERVICE.^]
   These [$quoth the world,$] are pretty toyes: I [$quoth the 
Phylosopher,$] but marke the applyance. By (^Iack Oates^) 
is Morrally meant, many discribed like him, though 
not Fooles naturall yet most artificiall, they carde hence 
what their Parents spin, and doe such Apish tricks, that 
rapine, ruine and a thousand inconueniences follow. By 
the knight is meant maintainers of Foolery: by the Hall, 
the Inne where the cards of vanity causeth many to be 
bewitcht as appeares in the seruing men, who busie in others 
braules are as easily made friends as they were set 
together by the eares. By the second is meant reach at Stars, 
ayming at honour, lighting somtime on the eare of 
memory, but ill taken because badly ment, is rewarded with a
deserued whipping. By the third is cald to question most 
that musically fret their time out in idle baubling, and 
will become artificiall Fooles to outbraue Fooles indeede, 
but stick often in their owne quick-sands, and are got out 
<P B4V>
with repentance. But the fourth and last shewes the 
deuouring of deuotions dyet, how euer come by yet they will 
stand vp to the arme-pits in daunger rather then to lacke 
their wils, to slacke or rebate the edge of their appetites: 
[$with this the world a little humde and haide, said shee was 
not pleased that such liued and did promise some 
amendment, but desired to see further.$]
<P C1R>
[^THE KING'S JESTER JEMY GOES ON A SEA VOYAGE.^] 
[^...^] [$To sea they put in a ship, at
whose departure they discharged Ordinance, as one that
departed from the land with the Kings fauour: the Earle 
(^Huntly^) was sent with him to sea, to accompany him, so high 
he was esteemed with the King. Who hearing the 
Ordinance goe off, would aske what doe they now?$] Marry [$saies 
the Earle,$] they shoot at our enimies: O [$sayes hee,$] hit I 
pray God. [$Againe they discharge,$] what do they now [$quoth 
hee?$] marry now the enimie shoots at vs. O misse I pray
<P C1V>
God [$ (sayes (^Iemy Camber^) ) so euer after it was a Iest in 
the Scottish Court,$] (^hit or misse quoth Iemy Camber^) : [$that 
if a maide had a Barne and did pennance at the Crosse in 
the high Towne of (^Edinborough^) :$] what hath shee done? 
did she hit or misse? she hath hit [$sayes the other,$] better she 
had mist [$sayes the first:$] [^---^] 
[^THEY PUT TO SEA; A STORM RISES AND ALL ARE TERRIFIED.^] 
[^...^] [$But the fat Foole seeing themselues in this
daunger, thought there was no way but one with them, 
and was halfe dead with feare, in the end the winde 
turned, and the raging of the Sea began to cease:$] I warrant 
thee now [$ (quoth the Maister) $] (^Iemy^) wee shall not bee 
drowned: I, will ye warrant vs, [$sayes the Foole?$] I [$sayes the 
Maister,$] Ile giue thee my ship for thy Chaine, if wee bee 
drowned: beare witnesse my Lord [$sayes hee,$] a plaine 
bargaine, [$and with that threw the Maister his Chaine, who 
would haue giuen it to the Earle, but ioy of their escape 
made him delight in the Iest, and therefore the Maister 
inioyed his bargaine. With much adoe they attained thether 
againe, where the king fearefull before, awayted their 
landing now, and seeing (^Iemy^) not a iot lesse of body then hee 
was (onely lightned of his Chaine) $] how now, [$quoth hee,$]
how dost thou man? O [$sayes (^Iemy^) ,$] well now King, but 
ill had not the Maister beene, who warranted our liues for 
my Chaine, the best bargaine that euer I made, for no way  
<P C2R>
could I haue been a looser: how [$sayes the King?$] marry Ile 
tell thee King, [$quoth he,$] say we had beene drowned, his ship 
was forfeit to me for my chaine, Earle (^Huntly^) was a 
witnesse to the bargaine: and now we are not drowned, for my 
chaine did warrant our liues of the master: nay [$sayes the 
Earle$] not our liues, none but yours (^Iemy^) , our liues were 
as safe vnwarranted without a chaine. [^...^]
[^THEY GO TO EDINBURGH.^] 

[$ (^Iemy^) this fat foole vsed euery day to goe from the Abbey
in the low towne, vp the hill into the Citie of
(^Edenborough^) , and one euening aboue the rest, he met with a 
broken Virgin, one that had had a barne (as there they are
knowne by their attire) wearing a loose kerchiefe hanging
downe backward, she I say cryed sallets, as thus:$] buy any
(\Cibus Salletea\) . [$ (^Iemy^) desirous of Sallets, calles her to  #
him,$]
lasse [$sayes he$] what shall I giue thee for a good sallet? faire 
sir [$sayes the wench (for shee knew him for the Kings foole, 
and she could not please him better then to call him fayre 
sir) $] you giue me an atchison [$now he hauing nothing but sixe
French Crownes about him,$] canst thou change mee a 
Crowne [$sayes he?$] yea sir [$sayes shee: he giues her a French 
Crowne, & she gaue him a sallet for it, & shee went her way.$]
   [$ (^Iemy^) thinks it was much to giue a crowne for that, for 
which she did demaund but an atchison: which in our 
money is but three farthings he runnes after and sayes, she 
had his fayrest crowne,$] but [$sayes he$] giue mee that and take 
your choyce of these: [$thinking by that deuise to get the first 
Crowne againe.$] Will ye chaunge [$sayes the lasse?$] I [$sayes 
the foole:$] [$so she takes all the fiue and giues him one againe, 
and so laughing at his folly, goes her way, it was in vaine 
<P C2V>
to exclayme, for they will hold fast what they get: but my
fat foole goes home to eate his Sallet, and inuites the King 
to a deere dish, and made him laugh heartely at the iest: 
The King calles for Viniger to his Sallet, because his 
sweet meate should haue sower sauce, and perswaded him 
it was well bought, otherwise if the foole had repented his
bargaine, it was his manner to cry for his mony againe, 
yet with it all the Court could not quiet him.$]

[$Betwixt (^Edenborough^) Abbey the Kings place & Leeth, 
there stands an euen plaine greene Meddow, in which 
the King vsed most of his sports: amongst which hee rode 
thether one day to run at the Gloue, or the Ring, as his 
Grace should please. With him rides (^Iemy Camber^) on a 
trotting Mule: it was then a meruailous hot day.$] O [$ (saies 
(^Iemy^) ) $] how cold the weather is [$ (so wise hee was that hee 
scarce knew hot from colde) $] No [$sayes the King$] it is hot,
looke how I sweat. No [$sayes (^Iemy^) $] the Sunne blowes very 
colde. No [$sayes the King,$] the winde shines very hot. [$The 
Foole was almost angry to be crossed and said, hee would 
be hanged at night if hee did sweat that day: with this 
merry talke they rode on: but one of the Kings footemen 
hearing this, told the King at their returne hee would make 
his Grace laugh hartely: so the King very gallantly ranne 
that time, and neuer mist the gloue, and so did the Lords:
which (^Iemy^) seeing said it was nothing to doe: The King 
bade him runne, he did so: but the Gloue lay still, and (^Iemy^) 
could not doe it.$]
   [$The Kings footman (that watcht to do him a good turne) 
said, (^Iemy^) could doe it better blindfold:$] what can he [$quoth 
the King,$] I will neuer beleeue it: you shall see else [$quoth he,
whereat (^Iemy^) marueiled much that without sight a man 
could doe that which with all his might and sight he could 
not doe, was desirous to make tryall, so was blinded with 
a scarfe, while another tooke vp the gloue, and was ready 
for the iest: (^Iemy^) runs,$] now for my Maistris [$saies hee, they 
<P C3R>
all shout aloud & cry rarely well done, and one vnblindes 
him, while another puts the gloue on the speare. So simple 
hee was, that he thought it was strange, & bragged all that 
day not a little, the king did alight and went to drinke wine 
at the Lord (^Humes^) house, and (^Iemy^) went with him, while 
the footeman had time to worke his will, and mingling a 
conceit with butter (which I will not name, least some one 
should practise the like) clapt it vnder the saddle, and as they
rode to (^Edenborough^) , sayes the King$] what say you to the 
weather now (^Iemy^) ? mee thinks it is hotter then it was? 
nay it is colder [$sayes he,$] for I begin to sweat. 
   [$The trotting of this Mule made the mingled confection 
lather so, that it got into his breeches, & wrought vp to the 
crowne of his head, & to the sole of his foote, and so he sweat
profoundly: still he wipt and he wipt, sweating more and 
more, they laught a good to see him in that taking:$] now 
you must be hanged [$quoth the King$] as your bargaine was, 
for you sweat very much: what remedie [$sayes hee,$] I am 
content to be hanged but while I liue after, Ile neuer 
beleeue cold weather will make on sweat: no more will I 
[$sayes the King,$] but hot weather will. Hot or cold, [$sayes 
(^Iemy^) ,$] I am warme now I am sure, I would I were ouer 
head and eares in some riuer to coole mee. [^...^]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P D2V>
[^...^] [$I say againe this Gentleman had a foole, (^Leonard^)
they call him, leane of body, looking like enuie, whose 
conditions agree with his countenance: one time aboue all 
other hee lockt himselfe into a Parlour, where all alone hee 
playd at slide groat, as his manner was, peeces or counters 
he had none, yet casting his hand empty from him,$] fly [$saies 
he, short with a vengeance: then$] play [$sayes hee (to his 
fellow) when indeede there is none but himselfe: but thus 
with supposes he playes alone, swaggers with his game 
fellow, out sweares him with a thousand oaths, challenges 
him the field to answere him if hee bee a man, appoynts 
the place and all, that if any not knowing his conditions, 
should stand without & heare him, would thinke two 
swaggerers were fighting in the roome.$]
[^LEONARD DESTROYS THE DAIRY.^]
<P D3R>
[^---^] but 
O the foole leane (^Leonard^) , [$they cryed,$] he did this mischiefe,
[$they complayned to their Master, but to no purpose,
(^Leonard^) was farre inough off, search was made for the foole, 
but hee was gone none knew whether, and it was his 
propertie hauing done mischiefe, neuer to come home of 
himselfe, but if any one intreated him, he would easily be won.$]
   [$All this while the foole was at Mansfield in Sherwood, 
and stood gaping at a shoomakers stall: who not knowing 
him asked him what he was?$] goe looke [$sayes hee,$] I know 
not my selfe: [$they asked him where he was borne:$] at my 
mothers backe [$sayes hee:$] in what country [$quoth they?$] in 
the country [$quoth he$] where God is a good man: [$at last one 
of the three iournymen imagined he was not very wise, &
flouted him very merrily, asking him if hee would haue 
a stitch where there was a hole? (meaning his mouth) $]
<P D3V>
I [$quoth the Foole,$] if your nose may bee the needle: [$the 
Shoomaker could haue found in his heart, to haue tooke 
measure on his pate with a Last in steede of his foote: but 
let him goe as he was.$]
   [$A Country Plow-iogger being by, noting all this, 
secretly stole a peece of Shoomakers waxe off the stall, &
comming behinde him, clapt him on the head, and asked him 
how he did: the Foole seeing the pitch ball pulled to haue 
it off, but could not but with much paine, in an enuious 
spleene, smarting ripe, runs after him, fals at fistie cuffes 
with him, but the fellow belaboured the Foole cunningly, 
and got the Fooles head vnder his arme, and bobd his 
nose: the Foole remembring, how his head was, strikes

   [$The World laughing a good at these iests, though to say 
sooth shee could hardly afford it, for feare of writhing her 
<P E1R>
sweet fauour, yet strayning curtesie in this kinde, did as our

alone cram most greedily. So shee forgetting modesty gapte 
out a laughter, and like women hardly wonne cryde$] more 
more. [$The currish Crittick said she should, and gaue her the 
third pennerth of the morrall, and said,$] you laugh at leane 
enuie in a long foole, but you haue cause to weepe at long 
enuie in a leane age, as you liue in. This foole cries not all 
mine, but distributes like a kinde companion, being a 
suficiall glasse to gaze in. There be leane fooles as well as fat,
such are they whose noses drops necessitie, and they smell 
out for Church lands, many tenaments, vnthrifts surfets, 
looking leanely in all this, but feede fatly in hope. This 
fatnesse goes to the heart, not seene in the visage. These seeme
simple, but like (^Leonard^) hit home at aduantage, they can 
stop mens mouths and seale them vp in aduantage, and 
giue the stocks to the simple deseruer, when themselues are 
not blamelesse. O beware when you see a long meager
looke, search him he hath also reaching fingers, and can slide 
a groat by himselfe as (^Leanord^) did, fall out, curse, sweare, 
and batter heauen it selfe with humour of folly. Such was 
the leane neckt Crane, who had the fat Foxe to dinner 
making him lick the outside of the glasse, while his leannesse fed
within. You vnderstand me madame, such are your 
landlords to the poore, your leane lords to the fat tennant, or by 
a figure one for the other. Thus they batten heere, but the 
Diuel will gnaw their bones for it.
   By the third iest we obserue a greedinesse in leane folly,

Heereupon comes in leane enuy swallowes fat bits, I mean

as the Lawyer the poore clyants plow pence, the cittie the 
country commodities, that vnder shew of leannes they fat
themselues to the ribs, good hold for flesh hookes at the 
generall waste. By the fourth and last (I would it were least)  
<P E1V>
it bewrayes a curious & common leannesse in lewd liuers, 
who to reuenge on others will fire their owne wheele
barrow. Like the leane tennant who fallen out with his 
landlord, and seeing his neighbours house on fire desired his
neighbours to pull downe his first, for feare of more 
danger, not that he loude his neighbours safety and his owne, 
but that hee hated his landlord. Or the contrary couetous 
of their owne commoditie fire themselues, and because 
they will not burne alone indanger their friends, and 
say tis kinde to haue company. These are fooles indeede 
leane ones, these are fat at soule & make thicke doings for

<P E2R>
[^OMISSION OF VERSE.^]
   Alas [$quoth the world,$] I am sorry trust me, that one so 
outwardly well, should bee so inwardly ill, and haue that 
apparance in nastie defect, which of it selfe is neate: but 
go on with the repeticion since wee are mended in the

it great in nature. (\Nemo sine crimine\) and so forth. I [$quoth

it well. 

[$In a Gentlemans house where (^Iack Miller^) resorted as he 
was welcome to all: it chanced so there was a Play, the 
<P E2V>
Players dressed them in the Gentlemans Kitchin, and so 
entred through the Entry into the Hall. It was after 
dinner when Pyes stood in the Ouen to coole for Supper: (^Iack^) 
had not dyned, and seeing the Ouen stand open, and so 
many Pyes there vntold (hee thought because they seemed 
numberlesse) $] O [$sayes (^Iack^) ,$] for one of them p. p. pyes,   #
[$for 
so hee stammered in speaking (the Players Boy being by, 
and in his Ladyes Gowne) could haue found in his heart 
to creepe in clothes and all: but hee perswaded (^Iack^) to do 
so, to which hee was willing, and very nimbly thrusts in his 
head into the hot Ouen, which being but newly opened, 
on the sodaine hee was singed both of head and face, and 
almost not a hayre left on his eye-browes, or beard: (^Iack^) 
cryes,$] O I burne, [$and had not the wit to come back, but 
lay still:$] [^---^]
[^JACK'S APPEARANCE CAUSES AMUSEMENT.^]

[$ (^Iack^) , on Newyeeres day in the morning, was to carry a 
Newyeres gift to a gentleman a myle off; and as he staid
<P E3R>
to haue it deliuered him to beare, asked which was the 
cleanest way thither? A fellow knowing his cleanlinesse, 
sends him ouer a durty marsh: and so hee folded vp his 
band (then cleane) for fouling, that at the gentlemans dore 
he might put it on. The present came, which (^Iack^) seeing, 
made legs to the gentlewoman, forgetting his band was 
in his hose, carried a stif neck to and fro to the 
gentlewoman, and what ere she spake, or where ere shee stood, (^Iack^)
would look but one way, as though his neck had bin starcht.$] 
And remember, [$saies the gentlewoman,$] you abuse not my 
message, nor my gift. No fo fo forsooth [$saies (^Iack^) : and away 
he goes, & thought he would see what it was, & as he went 
he lift vp the basket lid and lookt:$] Ah ha [$quoth (^Iack^) $] I see

[$But he I say seeing them goe by, creepes through the 
window, & said$] I come to thee (^Grumball^) . [$The Players stood all
still to see further. He got down very dangerously, & makes 
no more adoe but venters ouer the Hauen, which is by the 
long bridge, as I gesse some forty yards ouer: yet he made
nothing of it, but my hart aked when my eares heard the 
ise cracke all the way. When he was come vnto me, I was 
amazed, & tooke vp a brick bat (which lay there by) & threw 
it, which no sooner fell vpon the ise but it burst. Was not 
this strange, that a foole of thirty yeeres was borne of that 
ise which would not endure the fall of a brickbat? but euery 
one rated him for the deede, telling him the danger. He 
considered his fault, and knowing faults should be punished, he
intreated (^Grumball^) the Clowne who he so deerely loued to 
whip him, but with Rosemary, for that hee thought would 
not smart. But the Players in iest breecht him till the bloud 
came, which he tooke laughing, for it was his manner euer 
to weepe in kindnesse and laugh in extreames. That this is 
true, mine eies were witnesses being then by.$]

[$ (^Iack Miller^) welcomed to all places, & bard of none, came 
to a Gentleman, who being at dinner, requested him for 
<P E4R>
mirth, to make him a play, which he did, and to sing 
Derries faire, which was in this manner. First it is to bee 
noted, hee stutted hugely, and could neyther pronounce b. nor

(^As I went to Derries faire, there was I ware of a iolly begger,

braue Beggers, and his qualitie was, after hee began his

asked the way to the Court: euery one directs him, but one 
villaine Page directs him by the Court gate, to crosse in a 
<P F2R>
Boat ouer to Blackwal, and told him that was the Court. 
The silly old man willingly paid his penny before hand, & 
was going ouer: but some that ouer-heard their talk, 
hindred his iourney, and laughed at the Iest, yet pittyed his
simplicity, and sets him the right way. When he came in &
saw such a place, he was amazed and stood gazing: which the 
Gard & Gentlewomen in their windows had much sport 
to see: at last one asked him what hee was?$]
   [$The old man answeres,$] a poore Shropshire man [$& 
demaunds if there were not a Gentleman in the Court 
dwelling, called by the name of M. (^William Sommers^) ? (for the 
Country hearing him in fauour in the Court, said hee was 
so at least.) The Courtier answered,$] here is such a one 
indeed. For fault of a worse, [$saies hee,$] I am his Vncle, [$& wept
with ioy, that hee should see him.$] Marry [$sayes the man,$] Ile 
help you to him straight: [$for I tell you, not any in the court
durst but haue sought him, which this man did, and it was 
told them, hee was walkt into the Parke, while the King 
slept that hote day: thether went they to seeke him. All this 
while my friend (^William^) was in counsel with the post, and 
the cushen stood as arbitrator betwixt them, and the woman 
by as a witnesse what was said & done, at last, came these 
two and wakened him. (^William^) seeing his head soft,$] what 
soft post is this, [$quoth he?$] A post of mine own making, [$saies 
the woman. But she lost nothing by her good will: for ere 
she left (^Will Sommers^) , shee got him to get her sons pardon 
of the King, who was to bee hanged, three days after for 
piracy: but by (^Will Sommers^) meanes he deceiued the 
hangman. This and many good deeds he did to diuers.$]
   [$The foole being wakened, lookes about him, when he had 
thanked the woman, asked$] what newes? [$sayes the man,$] sir, 
here is your vncle come out of the Country to see you. God 
a mercy cousin, [$sayes (^Wil Sommers^) .$] I thank thee for thy 
labour, you cannot vncle me so. Yes truely Sir, I am your

indeed? by my vusse I am [$sayes the old man.$] Then vncle

roome for me & my vncle, & knaues bid him welcome. You

earthly man, they honoured him so much.$]
   [$But (^Will^) ready to enter the Presence, lookes on his vncle, 
and seeing him not fine enough to looke on the King:$] Come 
vncle [$sayes he,$] we will haue your geere mended, [$leads him 
to his chamber, & attires him in his best fooles coate, simply 
God wot, meaning well to him, and the simple old man as 
simply put it on, cap & all. But they come, and vp they came, 
and to the King they goe, who being with the Lord 
Treasurer alone merry, seeing them two, how (^Will^) had got 
another foole, knew there was sport at hand.$] How now [$saies the
King,$] what newes with you? O (^Harry^) [$saies he,$] this is my 
own vncle, bid him welcome. Wel [$said the King$] he is 
welcome. (^Harry^) [$sayes he,$] heare mee tell thee a tale, and I   #
will 
make thee rich, & my vncle shalbe made rich by thee. [$ (^Will^) tels 
the King, how (^Terrils frith^) was inclosed.$] (^Tirrils frith^) ,  #
[$sayes
the King?$] what is that? Why, the Heath where I was 
borne, called by the name of (^Terils Frith^) : now a 
gentleman of that name takes it all in, and makes all the people 
beleeue it is his, for it took the name from him: so that (^Harry^)
the poore pine, & their cattel are all vndone without thy help. 
   And what should I do [$sayes the King?$] Marry [$saies (^Will^) $]
send to the Bishop of Hereford, hee is a great man with 
(^Terrill^) , commaund him to set the (^Frith^) at liberty againe, 
who is now imprisoned by his meanes. And how shall I 
be rich by that [$sayes the King?$] The poore will pray for thee

thou 
art rich already. [$All this was done, & (^Wils^) vncle went home

Common, which place was worth twenty pound a yeere.$]

[$Howsoeuer these three things came in memory, & are for 
mirth incerted into stage playes, I know not; but that 
(^Will Sommers^) asked them of the King, it is certaine, there 
are some will affirme it now liuing at Greenewich. The

the foole of the play doth with an anticke looke, to please the
beholders.$] (^Harry^) [$sayes he,$] what is that the lesser it is,  #

more it is to bee feared? [$The King mused at it, but to grace 
the iest better he answered he knew not. (^Will^) made
answere it was a little bridge ouer a deepe riuer, at which hee 
smyled.$] What is the next (^William^) [$sayes the King?$] Marry
this is next, what is the cleanliest trade in the world? Mary

nothing but pure ware, & is attired cleane in white linnen 
when he sels it. No (^Harry^) [$sayes (^Will^) ,$] you are wide. What

this is a wonder [$qd the King,$] & no question, I know it not.

Why [$qd (^Will^) $] it is a fart. [$At this the King laught         #

   [$Meaning the foole, in whose beard & head the bread and

plaister) to get him out againe: but neuer after came my 
Iugler in the Court more, so neere the King, being such a 
dangerous man to draw in the presence of the King.$]
   Now Lady world [$sayes (^Sotto^) $] you wonder at this first 
iest, do not tis common, for who so simple that being gordgd 
with broth themselues, will not giue their friends on 
spoonfull, especially our kinne. O weele to make them great make
our selues, & pollitikly rise againe by their greatnes. But 
hee was simple in that, for though he raised many, himselfe 
stood at one stay. But the deed is not common therefore may 
fitly be termed a fooles deed, since the wise meddle not with 
it, vnlesse to plunge further in and winde from pouertie. 
But leaue it the greatest power of all to remedie and 
reuenge, while earthly Maiestie growes great by adding 
liberty to their afflictions, as in our commons of late, God 
preserue him for it. By the second morrally, signification 
giues this, that fooles questions reach to mirth, leading 
wisdome by the hand as age leads children by one finger, and 
though it houlds not fast in wisedome, yet it points at it. 
Better so then the wise to put questions to fooles, for thats
to put the mony out of the bag, & leaue the mony behinde to 
bad vse, while themselues beg with the bag. Such like (^Will 
Sommers^) sleepe mongst dogs. The third bids vs charitably 
learne of simplicitie to pay our debts, when the poore 
creditor cals for it, but tis a generall fault, and such who haue
doores shut whereat the poore stand, shal find gates fast wher

driuell and breath together, would pray & make an end: which
being done,$] who bids me home to dinner now, [$sayes (^Iohn^) ? 
The Boyes that knew his qualities, answeres,$] that do I, 
(^Iohn^) . Thank ye friend [$sayes he, and goes home to his own 
dwelling at Christs Church. But at this time one wealthy 
Marchants son, to make his father merry, bad him home to 
dinner indeed, & will he or nill he, hee must go with him, with
much adoe (^Iohn^) went, & comming into the house, simply sits 
him downe (as his vse was) in the chimney corner. It was  
<P G2R>
in Lent, when pease pottage bare great sway, & when euery 
pease must haue his ease. (^Iohn^) beholding pease pottage on 
the fire, thought on his Nurse, for he was all sauing for her, &
seeing no body by, stept to the pot, & put a great ladle of 
pottage into his pocket, & pittiously burnt his thigh, & but that
the leather was thick, it had beene worse.$] 
   [$ (^Iohn^) feeling somthing burne, leapt & cryed: they ran in to 
see the matter why he cryed, but more & more he exclaimed,$]
I burn, I burn, [$& got out of doors, & neuer leaues til he came
to his nurse, who quickly shifted him, & mended what was 
amisse, but the iest was to see the folk of the house who 
wondring what he ayled, could not deuise what the matter was: 
but a begger in the entry, who beheld al, told the truth of the
matter, who lost a good almes for his labour.$] [^...^]
[^JOHN TOLLS THE CHURCH BELL.^] 
[^...^] [$They said,$] Wherfore toules the bel, (^Iohn^) ? I know not. 
When dyed he? euen now. Who, (^Iohn^) ? Who? my nurses 
chicken, [$quoth he, & laughs. This iest was knowne to euery
neighbour thereabouts, who sent to bid him leaue touling: 
but it was not his custome, till goodman (^Homes^) tooke the 
rope from him, that gaue the rope to him,$]
   [$Well, there stood (^Iack^) towling from foure a clock to sixe,
goodman (^Homes^) being from home, who was not a little 
vext at (^Iohns^) dilligence, but laid the rope euer after, where 
(^Iohn^) could not reach it.$]  

[$ (^Iohn^) was of this humor, ask him what his coat cost him,
he would say a groat: what his cap, band or shirt cost, all 
<P G2V>
was a groat: aske what his beard cost, and still a groat.$] [^...^]
[^A GENTLEMAN, NEEDING HIS BOOTS MENDED, SENDS JOHN TO THE COBBLER. 
A MAN SEES JOHN WITH THE BOOTS.^] 
[^---^] [$As (^Iohn^) was going
through Iuy lane, a Country fellow that knew him not,
meets him, and seeing the boots,$] What shall I giue thee for 
them [$saies he, (^Iohn^) (who sold euery thing for a groat) asked 
a groat. The fellow seeing it was a good penniworth, giues 
him a groat & departs with the boots. (^Iohn^) , as his vse was, 
gaue it to his Nurse. She asked him where hee had it? Hee 
said,$] for boots: [$but shee not knowing his minde, fell to work 
againe as he found her.$]
   [$The forfeiture of the bond so hammered in this 
Gentlemans head, that he thought euery houre two, till he had his
boots, & mused they came not from mending, sends for them
presently. One comes sweating,$] (zoones) Cobler the boots: [$& 
being at worke very busie,$] I [$sayes he,$] they are mended and 
carryed home. [$Another comes,$] boots, boots. Would the boots 
were in your belly, [$quoth the Cobler,$] once againe they are 
gone home. [$By and by comes the Gentleman in his white 
linnen boot-hose ready to the purpose.$] A poxe of lazy coblers 
[$sayes hee,$] my boots, shall I forfeit a bond for your pleasure? 
[$The Cobler puts of his considering cap,$] why sir, [$sayes hee,$]
I sent them home but now. By whom [$sayes he?$] By (^Iohn^) 
blew (^Iohn^) [$sayes the cobler. The Gentleman he runs home 
one way, the cobler another: well no boots were to be had:
the Gentleman hee stayed, and the Cobler hee prayed, but 
all this while the boots delaid and came not.
<P G3R>
The Cobler seekes (^Iohn^) at his nurses where he was, and 
found the boots were sould for a groat. The Cobler seeing 
no remedy, because the Gentleman was in hast, giues him 
fiue shillings with a heauy hey ho, towards a new paire, & 
lost foure shillings eight pence by the bargaine: but the 
cobler would neuer let (^Iohn^) carry home his ware more:$] nay, 
[$sayes the Cobler,$] if my money can be booted and ride poste 
so by fiue shillings at a time, it is no boot for me to say 
(^ (\Vtinam\) ^) , but the next bootes Ile make a page of my owne age, 
and carry home my selfe: for I see fooles will afford good 
pennyworths.
