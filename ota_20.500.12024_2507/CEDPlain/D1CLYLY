<P A4V>
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] Here commeth (^Alexander^) .
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] I see (^Hephestion^) , that these Philosophers are
here attending for vs.
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] They were not Philosophers, if they knewe
not their dueties.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] But I much meruaile (^Diogenes^) shoulde bee so
dogged.
<P B1R>
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] I do not think but his excuse wilbe better
then (^Melippus^) message.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] I wil go see him (^Hephestion^) , because I long  #
to
see him that would commaunde (^Alexander^) to come, to
whom all the world is like to come. (^Aristotle^) & the reste
sithence my comming from (^Thebes^) to (^Athens^) , from a
place of conqueste to a pallace of quiet, I haue resolued
with my self in my court to haue as many Philosophers
as I had in my camp soldiers. My court shalbe a schoole,
wherein I wil haue vsed as great doctrine in peace, as I 
did in warre discipline.
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] We are al here ready to be commanded, & glad
we are that we are commanded, for that nothing better
becommeth kinges then literature, which maketh them
come as neere to the Gods in wisdome, as they doe in
dignitie.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] It is so (^Aristotle^) , but yet there is among   #
you,
yea & of your bringing vp, that sought to destroy 
(^Alexander^) , (^Calistenes^) , (^Aristotle^) , whose treasons      #
againste his
prince shall not bee borne out with the reasons of his
Phylosophy.
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] If euer mischiefe entred into the hearte of
(^Calistenes^) , let (^Calistenes^) suffer for it, but that          #
(^Aristotle^) euer
imagined any such thing of (^Calistenes^) , (^Aristotle^) doth 
denie.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Well (^Aristotle^) , kindred may blind thee, and
affection mee, but in kinges causes I will not stande to
schollers arguments. This meeting shalbe for a 
co~mandement, that you all frequente my courte, instructe the
young with rules, confirme the olde with reasons: lette
your liues be answerable to your learninges, leaste my
proceedinges be contrary to my promises.
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] You sayde you woulde aske euerye one
of them a question, which yester night none of vs could
aunswere.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] I will. (^Plato^) , of all beastes, which is the 
subtillest?
<P B1V>
   [$ (^Plato^) $] That which man hetherto neuer knew.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Aristotle^) , how should a man bee thought a    #
God?
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] In doing a thing vnpossible for a man.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Crisyppus^) , which was first, the day or the   #
night?
   [$ (^Crisip.^) $] The day by a day.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] In deede straunge questions must haue straung
answers. (^Cleanthes^) , what say you, is life or death
the stronger?
   [$ (^Clean.^) $] Life, that suffereth so many troubles.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Crates^) , how long should a man liue?
   [$ (^Crates^) $] Till he think it better to die then liue.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Anaxarchus^) , whether doth the sea or the earth
bring forth most creatures?
   [$ (^Anax.^) $] The earth, for the sea is but a parte of the
earth.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Hephestion^) , me thinkes they haue answered all
well, and in such questions I meane often to trye them.
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] It is better to haue in your court a wise      #
manne,
then in your ground a golden mine. Therefore would I
leaue war, to studie wisdome, were I (^Alexander^) .
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] So would I, were I (^Hephestion^) . But come let  #
vs go
and giue release, as I promised to our (^Theban^)
thralles.
[$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]

   [$ (^Plato^) $] Thou art fortunate (^Aristotle^) , that           #
(^Alexander^) is
thy scholler.
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] And all you happy that he is your souereigne.
   [$ (^Crisip.^) $] I could like the man well, if he could be 
conte~ted to be but a man.
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] He seeketh to draw neere to the Gods in 
knowledge, not to be a God.
   [$ (^Plato^) $] Let vs questio~ a litle with (^Diogines^) , why   #
he went
not with vs to (^Alexander^) . (^Diogenes^) , thou didst forget thy
duetie, that thou wentst not with vs to the king.
<P B2R>
   [$ (^Dioge.^) $] And you your profession, that you went to the
king.
   [$ (^Plato^) $] Thou takest as great pride to be peeuish, as 
others do glory to be vertuous.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] And thou as great honor being a Philosopher
to be thought courtlike, as others shame that be 
courtiers, to be accounted Philosophers.
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] These austere maners set aside, it is wel known
that thou didst counterfeit money.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] And thou thy manners, in that thou didst not
counterfeit money.
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] Thou hast reason to contemn the court, being
both in bodye and minde too crooked for a 
courtier.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] As good bee crooked, and endeuour to make
my selfe straight from the court, as to bee straighte, and
learne to be crooked at the court.
   [$ (^Crates^) $] Thou thinkest it a grace to be opposite against
(^Alexander^) .
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] And thou to be iumpe with (^Alexander^) .
   [$ (^Anaxar.^) $] Let vs goe: for in co~temning him, we shal 
better please him, then in wondring at him.
   [$ (^Arist.^) $] (^Plato^) , what doest thou thinke of            #
(^Diogenes^) ?
   [$ (^Plato^) $] To be (^Socrates^) furious, let vs goe.
[$ (^ (\Exeunt philosophi.\) ^) $]

[} (\ACTUS SECUNDUS, SCHAENA PRIMA.\) }]
[$ (^Diogenes, Psyllus, Manes, Granichus.^) $]

   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Behold (^Manes^) where thy maister is, seeking
either for bones for his dinner, or pinnes for his sleeues.
I will goe salute him.
   [$ (^Manes^) $] Doe so, but mum not a word that you sawe
(^Manes^) . 
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] Then staye thou behinde, and I will goe with 
(^Psyllus^) .
<P B2V>
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] All hayle (^Diogenes^) to your proper person.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] All hate to thy peeuish conditions.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] O Dogge.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] What dost thou seeke for here?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] For a man and a beast.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] That is easie without thy light to be founde,
be not all these men?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Called men.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] What beast is it thou lookest for?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] The beast my man (^Manes^) .
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] He is a beast in deede that wil serue thee.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] So is he that begat thee.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] What wouldest thou do, if thou shuldest finde
(^Manes^) ?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Giue him leaue to doe as hee hath done 
beefore.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] Whats that?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] To runne away.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Why, hast thou no neede of (^Manes^) ?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] It were a shame for (^Diogenes^) to haue neede of
(^Manes^) , and for (^Manes^) to haue no neede of (^Diogenes^) .
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] But put the case he were gone, wouldst thou
entertaine any of vs two?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Vppon condition.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] What?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] That you should tell mee wherefore anye of
you both were good.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] Why, I am a scholler, and well seene in 
Philosophy.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] And I a prentice, and well seene in paynting.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Well then (^Granichus^) , be thou a painter to 
amende thine ill face, and thou (^Psyllus^) a Philosopher to
correct thine euil manners. But who is that (^Manes^) ?
   [$ (^Manes^) $] I care not whoe I were so I were not 
(^Manes^) .
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] You are taken tardie.
<P B3R>
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Let vs slip aside (^Granichus^) , to see the 
salutation betweene (^Manes^) and his maister.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] (^Manes^) , thou knowest the last daye I threw 
away my dish, to drink in my hand, because it was 
superfluous, now I am determined to put away my man, and
serue my selfe: (^ (\Quia non egeo tui vel te\) ^) .
   [$ (^Manes^) $] Maister, you know a while agoe I ran away,
so doe I meane to doe againe, (^ (\quia scio tibi non esse 
argentum\) ^) .
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] I know I haue no money, neither will I haue
euer a man: for I was resolued long sithe~ce to put away
both my slaues, money and (^Manes^) .
   [$ (^Manes^) $] So was I determined to shake off both my
dogges, hunger and (^Diogenes^)
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] O sweete concent betweene a crowde and a 
Iewes harpe.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] Come, let vs reconcile them
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] It shal not neede: for this is their vse, now do
they dine one vpon an other.
[$ (^Exit Diog.^) $]
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] How nowe (^Manes^) , art thou gone from thy
mayster.
   [$ (^Manes^) $] No, I didde but nowe binde my selfe to
him.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Why, you were at mortall iars.
   [$ (^Manes^) $] In faith no, we brake a bitter iest one vppon
another.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] Why, thou art as dogged as he.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] My father knew them both litle whelpes.
   [$ (^Manes^) $] Well, I wil hie me after my maister.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] Why, is it supper time with (^Diogenes^) ?
   [$ (^Manes^) $] I, with him at al times when he hath meate.
   [$ (^Psyllus.^) $] Why then euerye man to his home, and let
vs steale out againe anon.
   [$ (^Grani.^) $] Where shall we meete.
<P B3V>
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Why, at (^ (\Ala vendibili suspensa haedera non #
est 
opus\) ^) .
   [$ (^Manes^) $] O (^Psyllus^) , (^ (\habeo te loco                #
parentis\) ^) , thou
blessest me.
[$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]

[} (\ACTUS SECUNDUS, SCHAENA SECUNDA.\) }]

[$ (^Alexander, Hephestion, Page, Diogenes, Apelles.^) $]

   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Stand aside sir boy, till you bee called. 
(^Hephestion^) , how doe yee like the sweete face of (^Campaspe^) ?
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] I cannot but commend the stout courage of
(^Timoclea^) .
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Without doubt (^Campaspe^) had som great man
to her father.
   [$ (^Hephe.^) $] You know (^Timoclea^) had (^Theagines^) to her 
brother.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Timoclea^) stil in thy mouth, art thou not in   #
loue?
   [$ (^Hephe.^) $] Not I.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Not with (^Timoclea^) you meane, wherein you
resemble the Lapwing, who crieth most where her neast
is not. And so you lead me from espying your loue with
(^Campaspe^) , you cry (^Timoclea^) .
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] Coulde I aswell subdue kingdomes, as I
can my thoughtes, or were I as farre from ambition, as
I am from loue, all the world would account me as 
valiaunt in armes as I know my self moderate in affection.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Is loue a vice?
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] It is no vertue.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Well, nowe shalt thou see what small 
difference I make betweene (^Alexander^) and (^Hephestion^) . And
sith thou hast beene alwaies partaker of my triumphes, 
thou shalt be partaker of my tormentes. I loue 
(^Hephestion^) , I loue I loue (^Campaspe^) , a thing farre vnfit    #
for a 
Macedonian, for a king, for (^Alexander^) . Whye hangest thou
downe thy head (^Hephestion^) ? blushing to hear that which 
<P B4R>
I am not ashamed to tell.
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] Might my wordes craue pardon and my
counsell credit, I woulde both discharge the duetie of a
subiect, for so I am, and the office of a friend, for so I wil. 
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Speake (^Hephestion^) , for whatsoeuer is spoken, 
(^Hephestion^) speaketh to (^Alexander^) .
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] I cannot tell (^Alexander^) , whether the      #
reporte
be more shamefull to be heard, or the cause sorowfull to
be beleeued? What, is the sonne of (^Phillip^) , king of 
Macedon become the subiect of (^Campaspe^) , the captiue of 
(^Thebes^) ? Is that minde, whose greatnes the world coulde not
containe, drawn within the compasse of an idle alluring
eie? Wil you handle the spindle with (^Hercules^) , when you
shuld shake the speare with (^Achilles^) ? Is the warlike sound
of drumme and trumpe turned to the softe noyse of lire
and lute, the neighing of barbed steedes, whose loudnes
filled the ayre with terrour, and whose breathes 
dimmed the sunne with smoake, conuerted to delicate tunes
and amorous glaunces? O (^Alexander^) , that soft and 
yeelding minde should not bee in him, whose hard and 
vnconquered heart hath made so many yeelde. But you
loue, ah griefe, but whom? (^Campaspe^) , ah shame, a maide
forsooth vnknowne, vnnoble, and who can tell whether
immodest? whose eies are framed by arte to inamour,
and whose heart was made by nature to enchaunt. I, but
she is bewtiful, yea, but not therefore chaste: I, but she is
comly in al partes of the body: yea, but she may be 
crooked in some parte of the mind: I, but she is wise, yea, but
she is a woman: Bewtie is like the blackberry, which 
seemeth red, when it is not ripe, resembling pretious stones
that are polished with honney, which the smother they
look, the sooner they breake. It is thought wonderful 
among the sea men, that (^Mugil^) of all fishes the swifteste is
found in the belly of the (^Bret^) of all the slowest; And shal
it not seeme monstrous to wise men, that the hearte of
the greatest conquerour of the worlde, should be found
<P B4V>
in the handes of the weakest creature of nature? of a 
woman? of a captiue? (^Hermyns^) haue faire skinnes, but
fowle liuers, Sepulchers fresh colours, but rotten bones,
women faire faces, but false heartes. Remember 
(^Alexander^) thou haste a campe to gouerne, not a chamber, fall
not from the armour of (^Mars^) to the armes of (^Venus^) , fro~
the fiery assaults of warre, to the maidenly skirmishes of
loue from displaying the Eagle in thine ensigne, to sette
downe the sparrow. I sigh (^Alexander^) that where fortune
could not counquer, folly should ouercome. But behold
al the perfection that may be in (^Campaspe^) , a haire curling
by nature, not arte: sweete alluring eies, a faire face made
in despite of (^Venus^) , and a stately porte in disdaine of 
(^Iuno^) , a witte apt to conceaue, and quick to aunswere, a skin
as softe as silke, and as smooth as iet, a long white hand,
a fine little foote, to conclude, all partes aunswerable to
the best part, what of this? Though she haue heauenlye
gifts, vertue and bewtie, is she not of earthly mettal flesh
and bloud? You (^Alexander^) that would be a God, shewe
your self in this worse then a man, so soone to bee both
ouerseene and ouertaken in a woman, whose false teares
know their true times, whose smooth wordes wounde
deeper then sharpe swordes. There is no surfeit so 
dangerous, as that of honeye, nor any poyson so deadly, as
that of loue, in the one phisicke cannot preuaile, nor in
the other counsel.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] My case were light (^Hephestion^) , and not 
worthy to be called loue, if reason were a remedie, or 
sente~ses could salue, that sense cannot conceaue. Litle do you
know, and therefore sleightly doe you regard the dead
embers in a priuate perso~, or liue coles in a great prince,
whose passions and thoughts do as farre exceede others
in extremitie, as their callinges doe in Maiestie. An 
Eclipse in the Sunne is more then the fallinge of a starre,
none can conceiue the tormentes of a king, vnlesse hee
be a king, whose desires are not inferiour to their 
<P C1R>
dignities. And then iudge (^Hephestion^) if the agonies of loue be
dangerous in a subiect, whether they be not more then
deadly vnto (^Alexander^) , whose deep and not to be 
conceiued [^SOURCE TEXT HAS "con ceiued" DIVIDED BY LINE BREAK^]     #
sighes, cleaue the heart in shiuers, whose 
wounded thoughtes can neither be expressed nor endured.
Cease then (^Hephestion^) with argumentes to seeke to refel
that, which with their deitie the Gods cannot resist, and
let this suffice to aunswere thee, that it is a king that 
loueth and (^Alexander^) , whose affections are not to be 
measured by reason, being immortall, nor I feare me to bee
borne being intollerable.
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] I must needes yeeld, when neither reason nor
counsel can be heard.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Yeelde (^Hephestion^) , for (^Alexander^) doth    #
loue, &
therefore must obtaine.
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] Suppose she loues not you, affection co~meth
not by appointmente or birth, and then as
good hated as enforced.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] I am a king, and wil commaund.
   [$ (^Hephe.^) $] You may, to yeelde to luste by force, but to
consent to loue by feare you cannot.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Why, what is that, which (^Alexander^) maye not
conquer as he list?
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] Why, that which you say the Gods cannot 
resiste, Loue.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] I am a conquerour, shee a captiue, I as 
fortunate, as she faire: my greatnes may answere her wants,
and the giftes of my minde, the modestie of hers: Is it
not likely then that shee should loue? Is it not 
reasonable?
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] You say that in loue there is no reason, and
therefore there can be no likelyhood.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] No more (^Hephestion^) : in this case I wil vse   #
mine
owne counsell, and in all other thine aduice, thou mayst
be a good soldier, but neuer good louer. Call my page.
Sirha, goe presentlye to (^Apelles^) , and will him to come to
<P C1V>
me without either delay or excuse.
   [$ (^Page^) $] I goe.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] In the meane season to recreate my spirits, 
being so neere, we will goe see (^Diogenes^) . And see
where his tub is. (^Diogenes^) .
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Who calleth?
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Alexander^) : how happened it that you woulde
not come out of your tub to my pallace?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Because it was as far from my tub to your 
pallace, as from your pallace to my tub.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Why then doest thou ow no reuere~ce to kings?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] No.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Why so?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Because they be no Gods.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] They be Gods of the earth.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Yea, Gods of earth.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Plato^) is not of thy mind.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] I am glad of it.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Why?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Because I would haue none of (^Diogenes^) minde,
but (^Diogenes^)
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] If (^Alexander^) haue any thing that may pleasure
(^Diogenes^) , let me know, and take it.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Then take not from me, that you cannot giue
me, the light of the world.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] What dost thou want?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Nothing that you haue.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] I haue the world at commaund.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] And I in contempt.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Thou shalt liue no longer then I will.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] But I shall die whether you wil or no.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] How should one learne to be content?
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Vnlearne to couet.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Hephestion^) , were I not (^Alexander^) , I     #
would wishe
to be (^Diogenes^) .
   [$ (^Hephest.^) $] He is dogged, but discrete, I cannot tell how
<P C2R>
sharpe with a kinde of sweetenes, full of wit, yet
too to wayward.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] (^Diogenes^) , when I come this way again, I wil  #
both
see thee, and confer with thee.
   [$ (^Diog.^) $] Doe.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] But here commeth (^Apelles^) , how now            #
(^Apelles^) , is
(^Venus^) face yet finished?
   [$ (^Apel.^) $] Not yet: Bewtie is not so soone shadowed, whose
perfection commeth not within the compasse
either of cunning or of colour.
   [$ (^Alex.^) $] Wel let it rest vnperfect, & come you with mee,
where I will shewe you that finished by nature, 
that you haue beene trifling about by arte.

[} (\ACTUS TERTIUS, SCHAENA PRIMA.\) }]
[$ (^Apelles, Campaspe.^) $]

   [$ (^Apel.^) $] Lady, I doubt whether there bee any colour so
fresh, that may shadow a countenance so faire.
   [$ (^Camp.^) $] Sir, I had thought you had beene commaunded
to paint with your hand, not to glose with your tongue,
but as I haue heard, it is the hardest thing in painting to
set down a hard fauour, which maketh you to dispair of
my face, and then shal you haue as great thanks to spare
your labour, as to discredit your arte.
   [$ (^Apel.^) $] Mistresse, you neither differ from your selfe nor
your sex: for knowing your own perfectio~, you seeme to
dispraise that which men moste commend, drawing the~
by that meane into an admiration, where feedinge
themselues they fal into an extasie, your modestie being
the cause of the one, and of the other, your affections.
   [$ (^Camp.^) $] I am too young to vnderstande your speache,
thogh old enough to withsta~d your deuise: you haue bin
so long vsed to colours, you can do nothing but colour.
   [$ (^Apel.^) $] Indeed the colours I see, I feare, wil altar the 
colour I haue: but come Madam, wil you draw neere: for
<P C2V>
(^Alexander^) will be here anon. (^Psyllus^) , stay you heere at the 
window, if anye enquire for me, aunswere, (^ (\Non lubet esse
domi\) ^) .
[$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
[} (\ACTUS TERTIUS, SCAENA SECUNDA.\) }]
[$ (^Psyllus, Manes.^) $]

   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] It is alwaies my maisters fashion, when any fair
gentlewoman is to be drawne within, to make mee to
stay without. But if he shuld paint (^Iupiter^) like a Bul, like
a Swanne, like an Eagle, then must (^Psyllus^) with one hand
grinde colours, and with the other hold the candle. But
let him alone, the better he shadowes her face, the more
will he burne his own heart. And now if a manne coulde
meete with (^Manes^) , who I dare say, lookes as leane, as if
(^Diogenes^) dropped out of his nose.
   [$ (^Manes^) $] And heere come (^Manes^) , whoe hath as muche
meate in his maw, as thou hast honestie in thy 
head.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Then I hope thou art very hungry.
   [$ (^Manes^) $] They that know thee, know that.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] But doest thou not remember that wee haue
certeine licour to conferre withal.
   [$ (^Manes^) $] I, but I haue busines, I must go cry a thing.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Why, what hast thou lost?
   [$ (^Manes^) $] That which I neuer had, my dinner?
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Foule lubber wilt thou crie for thy dinner?
   [$ (^Manes^) $] I meane, I must cry, not as one wold saye cry,
but cry, that is, make a noyse.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Why foole, that is all one, for if thou cry,    #
thou
must needes make a noise.
   [$ (^Manes^) $] Boy, thou art deceiued Cry hath diuerse 
significations, and may bee alluded to manye thinges, knaue
but one, and can be applyed but to thee.
   [$ (^Psyllus^) $] Profound (^Manes^) .
   [$ (^Manes^) $] Wee (^Cynickes^) are madde fellowes, didste thou
<P C3R>

   [$ (^Apel.^) $] The proportion of the face in iust compasse, as I

   [$ (^Apel.^) $] If you wil paint, as you are a king, your Maiesty,

her head must be different from the habite of her body,
els would the picture seeme like the blason of auncient
Armorie, not like the sweete delight of new found 
amiablenes. For as in garden knottes diuersitie of odours
make a more sweete sauour, or as in musicke diuers
stringes cause a more delicate consent, so in painting, the
more colours, the better counterfeit, obseruing blacke
for a ground, and the rest for grace.

directly to any question, nor looked stedfastly vppon anye

   [$ (^Hephe.^) $] It may be: for commonly we see it incident in

(^Archidamus^) of his woodden doue, (^Pygmalion^) , of his iuorie

Image, (^Arachne^) of his wodde~ swan, especially painters,
who playing with their own conceites, now coueting to

which looking yellow in the ground, and blacke in the 
hand, thinke it better seene then toucht.

   [$ (^Hephe.^) $] A word by superstition thought a God, by vse

leadeth affection in fetters, vsing fa~cie as a foole to make

the amorous glaunce of an eie can settle an idle thought
