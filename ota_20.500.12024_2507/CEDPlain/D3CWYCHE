[$ (^Mrs.^) Margery Pinchwife, (^and^) Alithea: (^Mr.^) Pinchwife    #
(^peeping 
behind at the door^) .$] 

   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Pray, Sister, where are the best Fields and   #
Woods, 
to walk in in (^London^) ?
   [$ (^Alit.^) $] A pretty Question; why, Sister!  (^Mulberry       #
Garden^) , and 
St. (^James's Park^) ; and for close walks the (^New Exchange^) .
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Pray, Sister, tell me why my Husband looks so 
grum here in Town? and keeps me up so close, and will not 
let me go a walking, nor let me wear my best Gown 
yesterday?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] O he's jealous, Sister.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Jealous, what's that?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] He's afraid you shou'd love another Man.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] How shou'd he be afraid of my loving another 
man, when he will not let me see any but himself.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Did he not carry you yesterday to a Play?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Ay, but we sate amongst ugly People, he wou'd 
not let me come near the Gentry, who sate under us, so that 
I cou'd not see'em: He told me, none but naughty Women 
sate there, whom they tous'd and mous'd; but I wou'd have 
ventur'd for all that.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] But how did you like the Play?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Indeed I was aweary of the Play, but I lik'd 
hugeously the Actors; they are the goodlyest proper'st Men, 
Sister.
<P 16>
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] O but you must not like the Actors, Sister.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Ay, how shou'd I help it, Sister? Pray, Sister, 
when my Husband comes in, will you ask leave for me to go a 
walking?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] A walking, hah, ha; Lord, a Country Gentlewomans 
leasure is the drudgery of a foot-post; and she requires as 
much airing as her Husbands Horses. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
[$ (^Enter Mr.^) Pinchwife (^to them^) .$]
But here comes your Husband; I'll ask, though I'm sure he'l 
not grant it.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] He says he won't let me go abroad, for fear of 
catching the Pox.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Fye, the small Pox you shou'd say.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $]  Oh my dear, dear Bud, welcome home; why 
dost thou look so fropish, who has nanger'd thee?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Your a Fool. [$ (^Mrs.^) Pinch (^goes aside,   #
& cryes^) .$]
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Faith so she is, for crying for no fault, poor
tender Creature!
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] What you wou'd have her as impudent as your 
self, as errant a Jilflirt, a gadder, a Magpy, and to say all a 
meer notorious Town-Woman?
   [$ (^Alit.^) $] Brother, you are my only Censurer; and the honour 
of your Family shall sooner suffer in your Wife there, than in 
me, though I take the innocent liberty of the Town.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Hark you Mistriss, do not talk so before my    #
Wife, 
the innocent liberty of the Town!
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Why, pray, who boasts of any intrigue with me?   #
what 
Lampoon has made my name notorious? what ill Women 
frequent my Lodgings? I keep no Company with any 
Women of scandalous reputations.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] No, you keep the Men of scandalous reputations 
Company.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Where? wou'd you not have me civil? answer'em in a 
Box at the Plays? in the drawing room at (^Whitehal^) ? in St. 
(^James's Park^) ? (^Mulberry-garden^) ? or -- 
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Hold, hold, do not teach my Wife, where the 
Men are to be found; I believe she's the worse for your Town 
<P 17>
documents already; I bid you keep her in ignorance as I do.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Indeed be not angry with her Bud, she will tell 
me nothing of the Town, though I ask her a thousand times 
a day.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Then you are very inquisitive to know, I find?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Not I indeed, Dear, I hate (^London^) ; our
Place-house in the Country is worth a thousand of't, wou'd I were 
there again.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] So you shall I warrant; but were you not talking 
of Plays, and Players, when I came in? you are her 
encourager in such discourses.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] No indeed, Dear, she chid me just now for     #
liking 
the Player Men.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Nay, if she be so innocent as to own to me her
liking them, there is no hurt in't -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
Come my poor Rogue, but thou lik'st none better then me?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Yes indeed, but I do, the Player Men are finer 
Folks.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] But you love none better then me?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] You are mine own Dear Bud, and I know you, 
I hate a Stranger.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Ay, my Dear, you must love me only, and not 
be like the naughty Town Women, who only hate their 
Husbands, and love every Man else, love Plays, Visits, fine Coaches, 
fine Cloaths, Fidles, Balls, Treates, and so lead a wicked 
Town-life.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Nay, if to enjoy all these things be a        #
Town-life, 
(^London^) is not so bad a place, Dear.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] How! if you love me, you must hate (^London^) .
   [$ (^Ali.^) $] The Fool has forbid me discovering to her the
pleasures of the Town, and he is now setting her a gog upon 
them himself.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] But, Husband, do the Town-women love the 
Player Men too?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Yes, I warrant you.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Ay, I warrant you.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Why, you do not, I hope?
<P 18>
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] No, no, Bud; but why have we no Player-men 
in the Country?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Ha -- Mrs. Minx, ask me no more to go to a Play.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Nay, why, Love? I did not care for going; but 
when you forbid me, you make me as't were desire it.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] So 'twill be in other things, I warrant.         #
[$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Pray, let me go to a Play, Dear.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Hold your Peace, I wo'not.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Why, Love?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Why, I'll tell you.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Nay, if he tell her, she'l give him more cause to 
forbid her that place. [$ (^Aside.^) $] 
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Pray, why, Dear?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] First, you like the Actors, and the Gallants may 
like you.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] What, a homely Country Girl? no Bud, no body 
will like me.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] I tell you, yes, they may.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] No, no, you jest -- I won't believe you, I    #
will go.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] I tell you then, that one of the lewdest Fellows 
in Town, who saw you there, told me he was in love with you.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Indeed! who, who, pray who wast?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] I've gone too far, and slipt before I was aware;
how overjoy'd she is! [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Was it any (^Hampshire^) Gallant, any of our 
Neighbours? I promise you, I am beholding to him.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] I promise you, you lye; for he wou'd but ruin
you, as he has done hundreds: he has no other love for
Women, but that, such as he, look upon Women like Basilicks, but 
to destroy'em.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Ay, but if he loves me, why shou'd he ruin me? 
answer me to that: methinks he shou'd not, I wou'd do 
him no harm.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Hah, ha, ha.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] 'Tis very well: but I'll keep him from doing
you any harm, or me either.
<P 19>
[$ (^Enter^) Sparkish (^and^) Harcourt.$]
But here comes Company, get you in, get you in.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] But pray, Husband, is he a pretty Gentleman,
that loves me?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] In baggage, in. [$ (^Thrusts her in: shuts the #
door.^) $]
What all the lewd Libertines of the Town brought to my 
Lodging, by this easie Coxcomb! S'death I'll not suffer it.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Here (^Harcourt^) , do you approve my choice? Dear, 
little Rogue, I told you, I'd bring you acquainted with all 
my Friends, the wits, and -- [$Harcourt (^salutes her^) .$]
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Ay, they shall know her, as well as you your   #
self 
will, I warrant you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] This is one of those, my pretty Rogue, that are to 
dance at your Wedding to morrow; and him you must bid 
welcom ever, to what you and I have.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Monstrous! -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] (^Harcourt^) how dost thou like her, Faith? Nay,  #
Dear, 
do not look down; I should hate to have a Wife of mine 
out of countenance at any thing.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Wonderful!
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Tell me, I say, (^Harcourt^) , how dost thou like #
her? 
thou hast star'd upon her enough, to resolve me.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] So infinitely well, that I cou'd wish I had a      #
Mistriss 
too, that might differ from her in nothing, but her love and 
engagement to you.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Sir, Master (^Sparkish^) has often told me, that #
his
Acquaintance were all Wits and Raillieurs, and now I find it.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] No, by the Universe, Madam, he does not railly now; 
you may believe him: I do assure you, he is the honestest, 
worthyest, true hearted Gentleman -- A man of such 
perfect honour, he wou'd say nothing to a Lady, he does not 
mean.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Praising another Man to his Mistriss!
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Sir, you are so beyond expectation obliging, that --
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Nay, I gad, I am sure you do admire her extreamly, 
I see't in your eyes. -- He does admire you Madam. -- By 
the World, don't you?
<P 20>
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Yes, above the World, or, the most glorious part of 
it, her whole Sex; and till now I never thought I shou'd 
have envy'd you, or any Man about to marry, but you have 
the best excuse for Marriage I ever knew.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Nay, now, Sir, I'm satisfied you are of the      #
Society
of the Wits, and Raillieurs, since you cannot spare your Friend, 
even when he is but too civil to you; but the surest sign is, 
since you are an Enemy to Marriage, for that I hear you hate 
as much as business or bad Wine.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Truly, Madam, I never was an Enemy to Marriage, 
till now, because Marriage was never an Enemy to me before.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] But why, Sir, is Marriage an Enemy to you now? 
Because it robs you of your Friend here; for you look upon 
a Friend married, as one gone into a Monastery, that is dead 
to the World.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] 'Tis indeed, because you marry him; I see Madam, 
you can guess my meaning: I do confess heartily and openly, 
I wish it were in my power to break the Match, by Heavens 
I wou'd.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Poor (^Franck^) !
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Wou'd you be so unkind to me?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] No, no, 'tis not because I wou'd be unkind to you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Poor (^Franck^) , no gad, 'tis only his kindness  #
to me.
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] Great kindness to you indeed; insensible Fop, let a 
Man make love to his Wife to his face. [$ (^Aside.^) $] 
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Come dear (^Franck^) , for all my Wife there that #
shall 
be, thou shalt enjoy me sometimes dear Rogue; by my 
honour, we Men of wit condole for our deceased Brother in 
Marriage, as much as for one dead in earnest: I think that was 
prettily said of me, ha (^Harcourt^) ? -- But come (^Franck^) , be 
not melancholy for me.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] No, I assure you I am not melancholy for you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Prethee, (^Frank^) , dost think my Wife that      #
shall be
there a fine Person?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] I cou'd gaze upon her, till I became as blind as you 
are.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] How, as I am! how!
<P 21>
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Because you are a Lover, and true Lovers are blind, 
stockblind.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] True, true; but by the World, she has wit too, as
well as beauty: go, go with her into a corner, and trye if she 
has wit, talk to her any thing, she's bashful before me.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Indeed if a Woman wants wit in a corner, she has it 
no where.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Sir, you dispose of me a little before your      #
time. -- 
[$ (^Aside to^) Sparkish.$]
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Nay, nay, Madam let me have an earnest of your 
obedience, or -- go, go, Madam -- [$Harcourt (^courts^) 
Alithea (^aside^) .$]
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] How, Sir, if you are not concern'd for the honour  #
of a 
VVife, I am for that of a Sister; he shall not debauch her: be
a Pander to your own VVife, bring Men to her, let'em make 
love before your face, thrust'em into a corner together, then 
leav'em in private! is this your Town wit and conduct?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Hah, ha, ha, a silly wise Rogue, wou'd make one 
laugh more then a stark Fool, hah, ha: I shall burst. Nay, 
you shall not disturb'em; I'll 
vex thee, by the World. [$ (^Struggles with^) Pinch. (^to keep 
him from^) Harc. (^and^) Alith.$]
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] The writings are drawn, Sir, settlements made;   #
'tis too 
late, Sir, and past all revocation.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Then so is my death.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I wou'd not be unjust to him.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Then why to me so?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I have no obligation to you.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] My love.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I had his before.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] You never had it; he wants you see jealousie, the 
only infallible sign of it.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Love proceeds from esteem; he cannot distrust my 
virtue, besides he loves me, or he wou'd not marry me.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Marrying you, is no more sign of his love, then
bribing your Woman, that he may marry you, is a sign of his 
generosity: Marriage is rather a sign of interest, then love; 
and he that marries a fortune, covets a Mistress, not loves 
<P 22>
her: But if you take Marriage for a sign of love, take it 
from me immediately.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] No, now you have put a scruple in my head; but 
in short, Sir, to end our dispute, I must marry him, my 
reputation wou'd suffer in the World else.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] No, if you do marry him, with your pardon, Madam, 
your reputation suffers in the World, and you wou'd be 
thought in necessity for a cloak.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Nay, now you are rude, Sir. -- Mr.               #
(^Sparkish^) , pray
come hither, your Friend here is very troublesom, and very 
loving.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Hold, hold -- [$ (^Aside to^) Alithea.$]
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] D'ye hear that?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Why, d'ye think I'll seem to be jealous, like a
Country Bumpkin?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] No, rather be a Cuckold, like a credulous Cit.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Madam, you wou'd not have been so little generous 
as to have told him.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Yes, since you cou'd be so little generous, as to
wrong him.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Wrong him, no Man can do't, he's beneath an 
injury; a Bubble, a Coward, a sensless Idiot, a Wretch so 
contemptible to all the World but you, that -- 
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Hold, do not rail at him, for since he is like   #
to be
my Husband, I am resolv'd to like him: Nay, I think I am 
oblig'd to tell him, you are not his Friend. -- Master 
(^Sparkish^) , Master (^Sparkish^) .
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] What, what; now dear Rogue, has not she wit?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Not so much as I thought, and hoped she had.
[$ (^Speaks surlily.^) $]
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Mr. (^Sparkish^) , do you bring People to rail   #
at you?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Madam --
   [$ (^Spar,^) $] How! no, but if he does rail at me, 'tis but in   #
jest 
I warrant; what we wits do for one another, and never take 
any notice of it.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] He spoke so scurrilously of you, I had no patience 
to hear him; besides he has been making love to me.
<P 23>
   [$ (^Har.^) $] True damn'd tell-tale-Woman. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Pshaw, to shew his parts -- we wits rail and make
love often, but to shew our parts; as we have no affections, 
so we have no malice, we -- 
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] He said, you were a Wretch, below an injury.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Pshaw.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Damn'd, sensless, impudent, virtuous Jade; well    #
since 
she won't let me have her, she'l do as good, she'l make me 
hate her.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] A Common Bubble.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Pshaw.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] A Coward.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Pshaw, pshaw.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] A sensless driveling Idiot.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] How, did he disparage my parts? Nay, then my 
honour's concern'd, I can't put up that, Sir; by the World, 
Brother help me to kill him; (I may draw now, since we have 
the odds of him: -- 'tis a good occasion too before my 
Mistriss) -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
[$ (^Offers to draw.^) $]
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Hold, hold.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] What, what.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I must not let'em kill the Gentleman neither, for 
his kindness to me; I am so far from hating him, that I wish 
my Gallant had his person and understanding: -- 
(Nay if my honour -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] I'll be thy death.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Hold, hold, indeed to tell the truth, the        #
Gentleman 
said after all, that what he spoke, was but out of friendship 
to you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] How! say, I am, I am a Fool, that is not wit, out 
of friendship to me.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Yes, to try whether I was concern'd enough for   #
you, 
and made love to me only to be satisfy'd of my virtue, for 
your sake.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Kind however -- [$ (^Aside.^) $] 
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Nay, if it were so, my dear Rogue, I ask thee
<P 24>
pardon; but why wou'd not you tell me so, faith.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Because I did not think on't, faith.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Come, (^Horner^) does not come, (^Harcourt^) ,    #
let's be gone 
to the new Play. -- Come Madam.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I will not go, if you intend to leave me alone   #
in the 
Box, and run into the pit, as you use to do.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Pshaw, I'll leave (^Harcourt^) with you in the    #
Box, to 
entertain you, and that's as good; if I sate in the Box, I 
shou'd be thought no Judge, but of trimmings. -- Come 
away (^Harcourt^) , lead her down.
[$ (^Exeunt^) Sparkish, Harcourt, (^and^) Alithea.$]
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] Well, go thy wayes, for the flower of the true Town 
Fops, such as spend their Estates, before they come to'em, 
and are Cuckolds before they'r married. But let me go look 
to my own Free-hold -- How --
[$ (^Enter my Lady^) Fidget, (^Mistriss^) Dainty Fidget, (^and^)
(^Mistriss^) Squeamish.$]
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Your Servant, Sir, where is your Lady? we are come 
to wait upon her to the new Play.
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] New Play!
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] And my Husband will wait upon you presently.
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] Damn your civility -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
Madam, by no means, I will not see Sir (^Jaspar^) here, till I have 
waited upon him at home; nor shall my Wife see you, till 
she has waited upon your Ladyship at your lodgings.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Now we are here, Sir --
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] No, Madam.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Pray, let us see her.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] We will not stir, till we see her.
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] A Pox on you all -- [$ (^Aside.^) $] 
she has lock'd the door, and is gone abroad. [$ (^Goes to the door, 
and returns.^) $]
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] No, you have lock'd the door, and she's within.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] They told us below, she was here.
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] (Will nothing do?) -- Well it must out then, to 
tell you the truth, Ladies, which I was afraid to let you know 
before, least it might endanger your lives, my Wife has just 
now the Small Pox come out upon her, do not be frighten'd; 
<P 25>
but pray, be gone Ladies, you shall not stay here in danger 
of your lives; pray get you gone Ladies.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] No, no, we have all had'em.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] Alack, alack.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Come, come, we must see how it goes with her,
I understand the disease.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Come.
   [$ (^Pin.^) $] Well, there is no being too hard for Women at their 
own weapon, lying, therefore I'll quit the Field. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
[$ (^Exit^) Pinchwife.$]
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] Here's an example of jealousy.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Indeed as the World goes, I wonder there are no 
more jealous, since Wives are so neglected.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Pshaw, as the World goes, to what end shou'd they 
be jealous.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Foh, 'tis a nasty World.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] That Men of parts, great acquaintance, and
quality shou'd take up with, and spend themselves and fortunes, 
in keeping little Play-house Creatures, foh.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Nay, that Women of understanding, great 
acquaintance, and good quality, shou'd fall a keeping too of little 
Creatures, foh.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] Why, 'tis the Men of qualities fault, they never
visit Women of honour, and reputation, as they us'd to do; 
and have not so much as common civility, for Ladies of our 
rank, but use us with the same indifferency, and ill 
breeding, as if we were all marry'd to'em.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] She says true, 'tis an errant shame Women of quality 
shou'd be so slighted; methinks, birth, birth, shou'd go for 
something; I have known Men admired, courted, and followed 
for their titles only.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] Ay, one wou'd think Men of honour shou'd not 
love no more, than marry out of their own rank.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Fye, fye upon'em, they are come to think cross
breeding for themselves best, as well as for their Dogs, and Horses.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] They are Dogs, and Horses for't.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] One wou'd think if not for love, for vanity a
little.
<P 26>
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Nay, they do satisfy their vanity upon us 
sometimes; and are kind to us in their report, tell all the World 
they lye with us.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Damn'd Rascals, that we shou'd be only wrong'd 
by'em; to report a Man has had a Person, when he has not 
had a Person, is the greatest wrong in the whole World, that 
can be done to a person.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] Well, 'tis an errant shame, Noble Persons shou'd 
be so wrong'd, and neglected.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] But still 'tis an erranter shame for a Noble       #
Person, to 
neglect her own honour, and defame her own Noble 
Person, with little inconsiderable Fellows, foh! -- 
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] I suppose the crime against our honour, is the same 
with a Man of quality as with another.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] How! no sure the Man of quality is likest one's 
Husband, and therefore the fault shou'd be the less.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] But then the pleasure shou'd be the less.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Fye, fye, fye, for shame Sister, whither shall we 
ramble? be continent in your discourse, or I shall hate you.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Besides an intrigue is so much the more notorious
for the man's quality.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] 'Tis true, no body takes notice of a private Man, 
and therefore with him, 'tis more secret, and the crime's the 
less, when 'tis not known.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] You say true; y faith I think you are in the right #
on't: 
'tis not an injury to a Husband, till it be an injury to our 
honours; so that a Woman of honour looses no honour with a 
private Person; and to say truth -- 
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] So the little Fellow is grown a private Person -- 
with her -- [$ (^Apart to^) Squeamish.$]
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] But still my dear, dear Honour.
[$ (^Enter Sir^) Jaspar, Horner, Dorilant.$]
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Ay, my dear, dear of honour, thou hast still so 
much honour in thy mouth --
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] That she has none elsewhere -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Oh, what d'ye mean to bring in these upon us?
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Foh, these are as bad as Wits.
<P 27>
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] Foh!
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Let us leave the Room.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Stay, stay, faith to tell you the naked truth.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Fye, Sir (^Jaspar^) , do not use that word naked.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Well, well, in short I have business at        #

and cannot go to the play with you, therefore wou'd have 
you go -- 
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] With those two to a Play?
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] No, not with t'other, but with Mr.             #
(^Horner^) , there 
can be no more scandal to go with him, than with Mr. (^Tatle^) , 
or Master (^Limberham^) .
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] With that nasty Fellow! no -- no.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Nay, prethee Dear, hear me. [$ (^Whispers to   #

   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Ladies. [$Horner, Dorilant (^drawing near^) 
Squeamish, (^and^) Daint.$] [$ (^Dain.^) $] Stand off. 
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] Do not approach us.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] You heard with the wits, you are obscenity all    #
over.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] And I wou'd as soon look upon a Picture of      #

and (^Eve^) , without fig leaves, as any of you, if I cou'd help it, 
therefore keep off, and do not make us sick.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] What a Divel are these?
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Why, these are pretenders to honour, as criticks to
wit, only by censuring others; and as every raw peevish, 
out-of-humour'd, affected, dull, Tea-drinking, Arithmetical Fop 
sets up for a wit, by railing at men of sence, so these for 
honour, by railing at the Court, and Ladies of as great honour, 
as quality.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Come, Mr. (^Horner^) , I must desire you to go #
with 
these Ladies to the Play, Sir.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] I! Sir.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Ay, ay, come, Sir.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] I must beg your pardon, Sir, and theirs, I will    #
not be 
seen in Womens Company in publick again for the World.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Ha, ha, strange Aversion!
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] No, he's for Womens company in private.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] He -- poor Man - he! hah, ha, ha.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] 'Tis a greater shame amongst lew'd fellows to be 
<P 28>
seen in virtuous Womens company, than for the Women to 
be seen with them.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Indeed, Madam, the time was I only hated virtuous 
Women, but now I hate the other too; I beg your pardon 
Ladies.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] You are very obliging, Sir, because we wou'd not be 
troubled with you.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] In sober sadness he shall go.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Nay, if he wo'not, I am ready to wait upon the     #
Ladies; 
and I think I am the fitter Man.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] You, Sir, no I thank you for that -- Master
(^Horner^) is a privileg'd Man amongst the virtuous Ladies, 'twill 
be a great while before you are so; heh, he, he, he's my Wive's 
Gallant, heh, he, he; no pray withdraw, Sir, for as I take it, 
the virtuous Ladies have no business with you.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] And I am sure, he can have none with them: 'tis 
strange a Man can't come amongst virtuous Women now, but 
upon the same terms, as Men are admitted into the great Turks 
Seraglio; but Heavens keep me, from being an hombre 
Player with'em: but where is (^Pinchwife^) -- 
[$ (^Exit^) Dorilant.$]
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Come, come, Man; what avoid the sweet society 
of Woman-kind? that sweet, soft, gentle, tame, noble Creature 
Woman, made for Man's Companion -- 
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] So is that soft, gentle, tame, and more noble      #
Creature 
a Spaniel, and has all their tricks, can fawn, lye down, suffer 
beating, and fawn the more; barks at your Friends, when 
they come to see you; makes your bed hard, gives you Fleas, 
and the mange sometimes: and all the difference is, the 
Spaniel's the more faithful Animal, and fawns but upon one 
Master.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Heh, he, he.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] O the rude Beast.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Insolent brute.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Brute! stinking mortify'd rotten French Weather, to 
dare -- 
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Hold, an't please your Ladyship; for shame     #
Master, 
<P 29>
(^Horner^) your Mother was a Woman -- (Now shall I never 
reconcile'em) [$ (^Aside.^) $]
Hark you, Madam, take my advice in your anger; you know 
you often want one to make up your droling pack of hombre 
Players; and you may cheat him easily, for he's an ill 
Gamester, and consequently loves play: Besides you know, you 
have but two old civil Gentlemen (with stinking breaths 
too) to wait upon you abroad, take in the third, into your 
service; the other are but crazy: and a Lady shou'd have a 
supernumerary Gentleman-Usher, as a supernumerary 
Coach-horse, least sometimes you shou'd be forc'd to stay at home.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] But are you sure he loves play, and has money?
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] He loves play as much as you, and has money as 
much as I.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Then I am contented to make him pay for his 
scurrillity; money makes up in a measure all other wants in Men. -- 
Those whom we cannot make hold for Gallants, we make 
fine. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] So, so; now to mollify, to wheedle him, --     #
[$ (^Aside.^) $]
Master (^Horner^) will you never keep civil Company, methinks 
'tis time now, since you are only fit for them: Come, come, 
Man you must e'en fall to visiting our Wives, eating at our 
Tables, drinking Tea with our virtuous Relations after 
dinner, dealing Cards to'em, reading Plays, and Gazets to'em, 
picking Fleas out of their shocks for'em, collecting Receipts, 
New Songs, Women, Pages, and Footmen for'em.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] I hope they'l afford me better employment, Sir.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Heh, he, he, 'tis fit you know your work before 
you come into your place; and since you are unprovided of 
a Lady to flatter, and a good house to eat at, pray frequent 
mine, and call my Wife Mistriss, and she shall call you 
Gallant, according to the custom.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Who I? -- 
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Faith, thou sha't for my sake, come for my sake 
only.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] For your sake --
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Come, come, here's a Gamester for you, let him 
<P 30>
be a little familiar sometimes; nay, what if a little rude; 
Gamesters may be rude with Ladies, you know.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Yes, losing Gamesters have a privilege with Women.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] I alwayes thought the contrary, that the winning
Gamester had most privilege with Women, for when you 
have lost your money to a Man, you'l loose any thing you 
have, all you have, they say, and he may use you as he 
pleases.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Heh, he, he, well, win or loose you shall have #
your 
liberty with her.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] As he behaves himself; and for your sake I'll give #
him 
admittance and freedom.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] All sorts of freedom, Madam?
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Ay, ay, ay, all sorts of freedom thou can'st   #
take, 
and so go to her, begin thy new employment; wheedle her, 
jest with her, and be better acquainted one with another.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] I think I know her already, therefore may venter
with her, my secret for hers -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
[$Horner, (^and Lady^) Fidget (^whisper^) .$]
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Sister (^Cuz^) , I have provided an innocent
Play-fellow for you there.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] Who he!
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] There's a Play-fellow indeed.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Yes sure, what he is good enough to play at    #
Cards, 
Blind-mans buff, or the fool with sometimes.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] Foh, we'l have no such Play-fellows.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] No, Sir, you shan't choose Play-fellows for us, we 
thank you.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Nay, pray hear me. [$ (^Whispering to them.^) $]
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] But, poor Gentleman, cou'd you be so generous? so 
truly a Man of honour, as for the sakes of us Women of 
honour, to cause your self to be reported no Man? No Man! 
and to suffer your self the greatest shame that cou'd fall upon 
a Man, that none might fall upon us Women by your 
conversation; but indeed, Sir, as perfectly, perfectly, the same Man 
as before your going into (^France^) , Sir; as perfectly, 
perfectly, Sir.
<P 31>
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] As perfectly, perfectly, Madam; nay, I scorn you 
shou'd take my word; I desire to be try'd only, Madam.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Well, that's spoken again like a Man of honour, all 
Men of honour desire to come to the test: But indeed, 
generally you Men report such things of your selves, one does 
not know how, or whom to believe; and it is come to that 
pass, we dare not take your words, no more than your 
Taylors, without some staid Servant of yours be bound with you; 
but I have so strong a faith in your honour, dear, dear, noble
Sir, that I'd forfeit mine for yours at any time, dear Sir.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] No, Madam, you shou'd not need to forfeit it for 
me, I have given you security already to save you harmless 
my late reputation being so well known in the World, 
Madam.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] But if upon any future falling out, or upon a 
suspition of my taking the trust out of your hands, to employ 
some other, you your self shou'd betray your trust, dear Sir; 
I mean, if you'l give me leave to speak obscenely, you might 
tell, dear Sir.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] If I did, no body wou'd believe me; the reputation 
of impotency is as hardly recover'd again in the World, as 
that of cowardise, dear Madam.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Nay then, as one may say, you may do your worst, 
dear, dear, Sir.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Come, is your Ladyship reconciled to him yet? 
have you agreed on matters? for I must be gone to 
(^Whitehal^) .
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Why, indeed, Sir (^Jaspar^) , Master (^Horner^) is #
a thousand, 
thousand times a better Man, than I thought him: Cosen 
(^Squeamish^) , Sister (^Dainty^) , I can name him now, truly not long 
ago you know, I thought his very name obscenity, and I 
wou'd as soon have lain with him, as have nam'd him.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Very likely, poor Madam.
   [$ (^Dain.^) $] I believe it.
   [$ (^Squeam.^) $] No doubt on't.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] Well, well -- that your Ladyship is as virtuous
as any she, -- I know, and him all the Town knows -- heh, he, 
<P 32>
he; therefore now you like him, get you gone to your 
business together; go, go, to your business, I say, pleasure, whilst 
I go to my pleasure, business.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Come than dear Gallant.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Come away, my dearest Mistriss.
   [$ (^Sr. Jas.^) $] So, so, why 'tis as I'd have it. [$ (^Exit     #

   [$ (^Hor.^) $] And as I'd have it.

[$Alithea, (^and Mrs.^) Pinchwife.$]

   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Sister, what ailes you, you are grown melancholy?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Wou'd it not make any one 
melancholy, to see you go every day fluttering about abroad, whil'st
I must stay at home like a poor lonely, sullen Bird in a cage?
   [$ (^Alit.^) $] Ay, Sister, but you came young, and just from the 
nest to your cage, so that I thought you lik'd it; and cou'd be 
as chearful in't, as others that took their flight themselves 
early, and are hopping abroad in the open Air.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Nay, I confess I was quiet enough, till my 
Husband told me, what pure lives, the (^London^) Ladies live abroad, 
with their dancing, meetings, and junketings, and drest every day 
in their best gowns; and I warrant you, play at nine Pins 
every day of the week, so they do.
[$ (^Enter Mr.^) Pinchwife.$]
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Come, what's here to do? you are putting the
Town pleasures in her head, and setting her a longing.
   [$ (^Alit.^) $] Yes, after Nine-pins; you suffer none to give her
those longings, you mean, but your self.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] I tell her of the vanities of the Town like a
Confessor.
<P 33>
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] A Confessor! just such a Confessor, as he that by
forbidding a silly Oastler to grease the Horses teeth, taught 
him to do't.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Come Mistriss (^Flippant^) , good Precepts are #
lost, 
when bad Examples are still before us; the liberty you take 
abroad makes her hanker after it; and out of humour at 
home, poor Wretch! she desired not to come to (^London^) , I 
wou'd bring her.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Very well.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] She has been this week in Town, and never
desired, till this afternoon, to go abroad.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Was she not at a Play yesterday?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Yes, but she ne'er ask'd me; I was my self the
cause of her going.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Then if she ask you again, you are the cause of  #
her
asking, and not my example.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Well, to morrow night I shall be rid of you; and 
the next day before 'tis light, she and I'll be rid of the Town, 
and my dreadful apprehensions: Come, be not melancholly, 
for thou sha't go into the Country after to morrow, Dearest.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Great comfort.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Pish, what d'ye tell me of the Country for?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] How's this! what, pish at the Country?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Let me alone, I am not well.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] O, if that be all -- what ailes my dearest?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Truly I don't know; but I have not been well, 
since you told me there was a Gallant at the Play in love 
with me.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Ha -- 
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] That's by my example too.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Nay, if you are not well, but are so concern'd.
because a lew'd Fellow chanc'd to lye, and say he lik'd you, 
you'l make me sick too.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Of what sickness?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] O, of that which is worse than the Plague,     #
Jealousy.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Pish, you jear, I'm sure there's no such      #
disease in 
our Receipt-book at home.
<P 34>
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] No, thou never met'st with it, poor Innocent
-- well, if thou Cuckold me, 'twill be my own fault -- 
for Cuckolds and Bastards, are generally makers of their own 
fortune. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Well, but pray Bud, let's go to a Play to     #
night.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] 'Tis just done, she comes from it; but why are
you so eager to see a Play?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Faith Dear, not that I care one pin for their #
talk 
there; but I like to look upon the Player-men, and wou'd 
see, if I cou'd, the Gallant you say loves me; that's all dear Bud.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Is that all dear Bud?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] This proceeds from my example.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] But if the Play be done, let's go abroad      #
however, 
dear Bud.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Come have a little patience, and thou shalt go
into the Country on Friday.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Therefore I wou'd see first some sights, to   #
tell 
my Neighbours of. Nay, I will go abroad, that's once.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I'm the cause of this desire too.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] But now I think on't, who was the cause of
(^Horners^) coming to my Lodging to day? that was you.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] No, you, because you wou'd not let him see
your handsome Wife out of your Lodging.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Why, O Lord! did the Gentleman come hither 
to see me indeed?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] No, no; -- You are not cause of that damn'd
question too, Mistriss (^Alithea^) ? -- (Well she's in the right
of it; he is in love with my Wife -- and comes after her -- 
'tis so -- but I'll nip his love in the bud; least he should
follow us into the Country, and break his Chariot-wheel near 
our house, on purpose for an excuse to come to't; but I think 
I know the Town. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Come, pray Bud, let's go abroad before 'tis   #
late;
for I will go, that's flat and plain.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] So! the obstinacy already of a Town-wife, and I
must, whilst she's here, humour her like one. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
Sister, how shall we do, that she may not be seen, or known?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Let her put on her Mask.
<P 35>
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Pshaw, a Mask makes People but the more
inquisitive, and is as ridiculous a disguise, as a stage-beard; her 
shape, stature, habit will be known: and if we shou'd meet 
with (^Horner^) , he wou'd be sure to take acquaintance with us, 
must wish her joy, kiss her, talk to her, leer upon her, and 
the Devil and all; no I'll not use her to a Mask, 'tis dangerous; 
for Masks have made more Cuckolds, than the best faces that 
ever were known.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] How will you do then?
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Nay, shall we go? the (^Exchange^) will be    #
shut, 
and I have a mind to see that.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] So -- I have it -- I'll dress her up in the    #
Suit, 
we are to carry down to her Brother, little Sir (^James^) ; nay, I
understand the Town tricks: Come let's go dress her; a 
Mask! no -- a Woman mask'd, like a cover'd Dish, gives a 
Man curiosity, and appetite, when it may be, uncover'd, 
'twou'd turn his stomack; no, no.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Indeed your comparison is something a greasie one: 
but I had a gentle Gallant, us'd to say, a Beauty mask'd, lik'd
the Sun in Eclipse, gathers together more gazers, than if it 
shin'd out. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]

[$ (^The Scene changes to the new^) Exchange: (^Enter^) Horner, 
Harcourt, Dorilant.$]

   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Engag'd to Women, and not Sup with us?
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Ay, a Pox on'em all.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] You were much a more reasonable Man in the
morning, and had as noble resolutions against'em, as a Widdower 
of a weeks liberty.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Did I ever think, to see you keep company with 
Women in vain.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] In vain! no -- 'tis, since I can't love'em, to be 
reveng'd on'em.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Now your Sting is gone, you look'd in the Box      #
amongst 
all those Women, like a drone in the hive, all upon you; shov'd 
and ill-us'd by'em all, and thrust from one side to t'other.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Yet he must be buzzing amongst'em still, like other 
old beetle-headed, lycorish drones; avoid'em, and hate'em as 
they hate you.
<P 36>
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Because I do hate'em, and wou'd hate'em yet more, 
I'll frequent'em; you may see by Marriage, nothing makes 
a Man hate a Woman more, than her constant conversation: 
In short, I converse with'em, as you do with rich Fools, to 
laugh at'em, and use'em ill.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] But I wou'd no more Sup with Women, unless I cou'd 
lye with'em, than Sup with a rich Coxcomb, unless I cou'd 
cheat him.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Yes, I have known thee Sup with a Fool, for his
drinking, if he cou'd set out your hand that way only, you were 
satisfy'd; and if he were a Wine-swallowing mouth 'twas 
enough.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Yes, a Man drink's often with a Fool, as he tosses #
with 
a Marker, only to keep his hand in Ure; but do the Ladies 
drink?
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Yes, Sir, and I shall have the pleasure at least of
laying'em flat with a Bottle; and bring as much scandal that 
way upon'em, as formerly t'other.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Perhaps you may prove as weak a Brother amongst'em 
that way, as t'other.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Foh, drinking with Women, is as unnatural, as
scolding with'em; but 'tis a pleasure of decay'd Fornicators, and 
the basest way of quenching Love.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Nay, 'tis drowning Love, instead of quenching it; 
but leave us for civil Women too!
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Ay, when he can't be the better for'em; we hardly 
pardon a Man, that leaves his Friend for a Wench, and that's 
a pretty lawful call.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Faith, I wou'd not leave you for'em, if they wou'd
not drink.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Who wou'd disappoint his Company at (^Lewis's^) ,  #
for 
a Gossiping?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Foh, Wine and Women good apart, together as 
nauseous as Sack and Sugar: But hark you, Sir, before you 
go, a little of your advice, an old maim'd General, when 
unfit for action is fittest for Counsel; I have other designs 
upon Women, than eating and drinking with them: I am in 
<P 37>
love with (^Sparkish's^) Mistriss, whom he is to marry to 
morrow, now how shall I get her?
[$ (^Enter^) Sparkish, (^looking about^) .$]
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Why, here comes one will help you to her.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] He! he, I tell you, is my Rival, and will hinder my 
love.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] No, a foolish Rival, and a jealous Husband assist  #
their 
Rivals designs; for they are sure to make their Women hate 
them, which is the first step to their love, for another Man.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] But I cannot come near his Mistriss, but in his
company.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Still the better for you, for Fools are most easily
cheated, when they themselves are accessaries; and he is to 
be bubled of his Mistriss, as of his Money, the common 
Mistriss, by keeping him company.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Who is that, that is to be bubled? Faith let me
snack, I han't met with a buble since Christmas: gad; I

the cold weather.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] A Pox, he did not hear all I hope. [$ (^Apart to^) #
Horner.$]
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Come, you bubling Rogues you, where do we
sup -- Oh, (^Harcourt^) , my Mistriss tells me, you have been
making fierce love to her all the Play long, hah, ha -- 
but I -- 
   [$ (^Har.^) $] I make love to her?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Nay, I forgive thee; for I think I know thee, and 
I know her, but I am sure I know my self.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Did she tell you so? I see all Women are like these 
of the (^Exchange^) , who to enhance the price of their 
commodities, report to their fond Customers offers which were 
never made'em.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Ay, Women are as apt to tell before the intrigue, as 
Men after it, and so shew themselves the vainer Sex; but 
hast thou a Mistriss, (^Sparkish^) ? 'tis as hard for me to believe 
it, as that thou ever hadst a buble, as you brag'd just now.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] O your Servant, Sir; are you at your raillery,    #
Sir? 
but we were some of us beforehand with you to day at the 
<P 38>
Play: the Wits were something bold with you, Sir: did you 
not hear us laugh?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Yes, But I thought you had gone to Plays, to laugh #
at 
the Poets wit, not at your own.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Your Servant, Sir, no I thank you; gad I go to
a Play as to a Country-treat, I carry my own wine to
one, and my own wit to t'other, or else I'm sure I shou'd
not be merry at either; and the reason why we are so
often lowder, than the Players, is, because we think we speak 
more wit, and so become the Poets Rivals in his audience: 
for to tell you the truth, we hate the silly Rogues; nay, so 
much that we find fault even with their Bawdy upon the 
Stage, whilst we talk nothing else in the Pit as lowd.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] But, why should'st thou hate the silly Poets, thou #
hast 
too much wit to be one, and they like Whores are only hated 
by each other; and thou dost scorn writing, I'am sure.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Yes, I'd have you to know, I scorn writing; but
Women, Women, that make Men do all foolish things, make'em 
write Songs too; every body does it: 'tis ev'n as common with 
Lovers, as playing with fans; and you can no more help 
Rhyming to your (^Phyllis^) , than drinking to your (^Phyllis^) .
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Nay, Poetry in love is no more to be avoided, than 
jealousy.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] But the Poets damn'd your Songs, did they?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Damn the Poets, they turn'd'em into Burlesque, as 
they call it; that Burlesque is a (^Hocus-Pocus-trick^) [^NO ITALICS #
FOR trick IN SOURCE TEXT^] , they have 
got, which by the virtue of (^ (\Hictius doctius\) ^) , (^topsey     #
turvey^) , 
they make a wise and witty Man in the World, a Fool upon 
the Stage you know not how; and 'tis therefore I hate'em 
too, for I know not but it may be my own case; for they'l 
put a Man into a Play for looking a Squint: Their 
Predecessors were contented to make Serving-men only their 
Stage-Fools, but these Rogues must have Gentlemen, with a Pox 
to'em, nay Knights: and indeed you shall hardly see a Fool 
upon the Stage, but he's a Knight; and to tell you the truth,
they have kept me these six years from being a Knight in 
earnest, for fear of being knighted in a Play, and dubb'd a Fool.
<P 39>
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Blame'em not, they must follow their Copy, the Age.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] But why should'st thou be afraid of being in a Play, 
who expose your self every day in the Play-houses, and as 
publick Places.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] 'Tis but being on the Stage, instead of standing   #
on a 
Bench in the Pit.
   [$ (^Dor.^) $] Don't you give money to Painters to draw you like? 
and are you afraid of your Pictures, at length in a Play-house, 
where all your Mistresses may see you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] A Pox, Painters don't draw the Small Pox, or
Pimples in ones face; come damn all your silly Authors
whatever, all Books and Booksellers, by the World, and all 
Readers, courteous or uncourteous.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] But, who comes here, (^Sparkish^) ? 
[$ (^Enter Mr.^) Pinchwife, (^and his Wife in Mans Cloaths^) ,
Alithea, Lucy (^her Maid^) .$]
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Oh hide me, there's my 
Mistriss too. [$Sparkish (^hides himself behind^) Harcourt.$]
   [$ (^Har.^) $] She sees you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] But I will not see her, 'tis time to go to        #
(^Whitehal^) ,
and I must not fail the drawing Room.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Pray, first carry me, and reconcile me to her.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Another time, faith the King will have sup't.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Not with the worse stomach for thy absence; thou 
art one of those Fools, that think their attendance at the 
King's Meals, as necessary as his Physicians, when you are 
more troublesom to him, than his Doctors, or his Dogs.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Pshaw, I know my interest, Sir, prethee hide me.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Your Servant, (^Pinchwife^) , -- what he knows us
not -- 
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Come along. [$ (^To his Wife aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Pray, have you any Ballads, give me six-penny 
worth?
   [$ (^Clasp.^) $] We have no Ballads.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Then give me (^Covent-garden-Drollery^)       #
[^NO ITALICS FOR Drollery IN SOURCE TEXT^] , and a 
Play or two -- Oh here's (^Tarugos^) Wiles, and the Slighted 
Maiden, I'll have them.
<P 40>
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] No, Playes are not for your reading; come along, 
will you discover your self? [$ (^Apart to her.^) $]
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Who is that pretty Youth with him, (^Sparkish^) ?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] I believe his Wife's Brother, because he's        #
something 
like her, but I never saw her but once.
   [$ (^Hor.^) $] Extreamly handsom, I have seen a face like it too;
let us follow'em.
[$ (^Exeunt^) Pinchwife, (^Mistriss^) Pinchwife, 
Alithea, Lucy, Horner, Dorilant (^following them^) .$]
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Come, (^Sparkish^) , your Mistriss saw you, and    #
will be 
angry you go not to her; besides I wou'd fain be reconcil'd 
to her, which none but you can do, dear Friend.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Well that's a better reason, dear Friend; I wou'd
not go near her now, for her's, or my own sake, but I can 
deny you nothing; for though I have known thee a great 
while, never go, if I do not love thee, as well as a new 
Acquaintance.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] I am oblig'd to you indeed, dear Friend, I wou'd 
be well with her only, to be well with thee still; for these 
tyes to Wives usually dissolve all tyes to Friends: I wou'd be 
contented, she shou'd enjoy you a nights, but I wou'd have 
you to my self a dayes, as I have had, dear Friend.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] And thou shalt enjoy me a dayes, dear, dear Friend, 
never stir; and I'll be divorced from her, sooner than from 
thee; come along -- 
   [$ (^Har.^) $] So we are hard put to't, when we make our Rival 
our Procurer; but neither she, nor her Brother, wou'd let 
me come near her now: when all's done, a Rival is the 
best cloak to steal to a Mistress under, without suspicion; 
and when we have once got to her as we desire, we throw 
him off like other Cloaks. [$ (^Aside.^) $]

The Fool her Gallant, and she, will muster up all the young

Seamstresses to follow us; what a swarm of Cuckolds, and

Come let's be gone Mistriss (^Margery^) .

   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Lord, what a power of brave signs are here! 
stay -- the Bull's-head, the Rams-head, and the Stags-head, 
Dear --
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Nay, if every Husbands proper sign here were
visible, they wou'd be all alike.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] What d'ye mean by that, Bud?
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] 'Tis no matter -- no matter, Bud.
   [$ (^Mrs. Pin.^) $] Pray tell me; nay, I will know.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] They wou'd be all Bulls, Stags, and Rams heads.

   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Come, dear Madam, for my sake you shall be
reconciled to him.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] For your sake I hate him.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] That's something too cruel, Madam, to hate me for 
his sake. 
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Ay indeed, Madam, too, too cruel to me, to hate my 
Friend for my sake.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I hate him because he is your Enemy; and you
ought to hate him too, for making love to me, if you love me.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] That's a good one, I hate a Man for loving you; if 
he did love you, 'tis but what he can't help, and 'tis your 
fault not his, if he admires you: I hate a Man for being of 
my opinion, I'll ne'er do't, by the World.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Is it for your honour or mine, to suffer a Man   #
to make 
love to me, who am to marry you to morrow?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Is it for your honour or mine, to have me jealous? 
That he makes love to you, is a sign you are handsome; and 
that I am not jealous, is a sign you are virtuous, that I think 
is for your honour.
<P 42>
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] But 'tis your honour too, I am concerned for.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] But why, dearest Madam, will you be more concern'd 
for his honour, than he is himself; let his honour alone for 
my sake, and his, he, he, has no honour -- 
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] How's that?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] But what, my dear Friend can guard himself.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] O ho -- that's right again.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Your care of his honour argues his neglect of it,  #
which 
is no honour to my dear Friend here; therefore once more, 
let his honour go which way it will, dear Madam.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Ay, ay, were it for my honour to marry a Woman, 
whose virtue I suspected, and cou'd not trust her in a Friends 
hands?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Are you not afraid to loose me?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] He afraid to loose you, Madam! No, no -- you may 
see how the most estimable, and most glorious Creature in the World, 
is valued by him; will you not see it?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Right, honest (^Franck^) , I have that noble      #
value for 
her, that I cannot be jealous of her.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] You mistake him, he means you care not for me, 
nor who has me.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Lord, Madam, I see you are jealous; will you wrest 
a poor Mans meaning from his words?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] You astonish me, Sir, with your want of jealousie.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] And you make me guiddy, Madam, with your 
jealousie, and fears, and virtue, and honour; gad. I see virtue 
makes a Woman as troublesome, as a little reading, or 
learning.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Monstrous!
   [$ (^Lucy.^) $] (Well to see what easie Husbands these Women of
quality can meet with, a poor Chamber-maid can never have 
such Lady-like luck; besides he's thrown away upon her, 
she'l make no use of her fortune, her blessing, none to a 
Gentleman, for a pure Cuckold, for it requires good breeding to be 
a Cuckold. [$ (^Behind.^) $]
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I tell you then plainly, he pursues me to marry  #
me.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Pshaw --
<P 43> 
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Come, Madam, you see you strive in vain to make 
him jealous of me; my dear Friend is the kindest Creature 
in the World to me.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Poor fellow.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] But his kindness only is not enough for me, without 
your favour; your good opinion, dear Madam, 'tis that must 
perfect my happiness: good Gentleman he believes all I say, 
wou'd you wou'd do so, jealous of me! I wou'd not wrong 
him nor you for the World.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Look you there; hear him, hear
him, and do not walk away so. [$Alithea (^walks carelessly, to and   #
fro^) .$]
   [$ (^Har.^) $] I love you, Madam, so -- 
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] How's that! Nay -- now you begin to go too far
indeed.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] So much I confess, I say I love you, that I wou'd 
not have you miserable, and cast your self away upon so 
unworthy, and inconsiderable a thing, as 
what you see here, [$ (^Clapping his hand on his breast, points at^) #
Sparkish.$]
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] No faith, I believe thou woud'st not, now his
meaning is plain: but I knew before thou woud'st not wrong me 
nor her.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] No, no, Heavens forbid, the glory of her Sex shou'd 
fall so low as into the embraces of such a contemptible 
Wretch, the last of Mankind -- my dear Friend here -- 
I injure him. [$ (^Embracing Sparkish.^) $]
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Very well.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] No, no, dear Friend, I knew it Madam, you see he 
will rather wrong himself than me, in giving himself such 
names.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Do not you understand him yet?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Yes, how modestly he speaks of himself, poor
Fellow.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Methinks he speaks impudently of your self,      #
since -- 
before your self too, insomuch that I can no longer suffer 
his scurrilous abusiveness to you, no more than his love to me. 
[$ (^Offers to go.^) $]
<P 44>
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Nay, nay, Madam, pray stay, his love to you: Lord, 
Madam, has he not spoke yet plain enough?
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Yes indeed, I shou'd think so.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Well then, by the World, a Man can't speak civilly 
to a Woman now, but presently she says, he makes love to 
her: Nay, Madam, you shall stay, with your pardon, since 
you have not yet understood him, till he has made an 
eclaircisment of his love to you, that is what kind of love it is; 
answer to thy Catechisme: Friend, do you love my Mistriss 
here?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Yes, I wish she wou'd not doubt it.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] But how do you love her?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] With all my Soul.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] I thank him, methinks he speaks plain enough now.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] You are out still. [$ (^to^) Alithea.$]
But with what kind of love, (^Harcourt^) ?
   [$ (^Har.^) $] With the best, and truest love in the World.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Look you there then, that is with no matrimonial
love, I'm sure.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] How's that, do you say matrimonial love is not   #
best?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Gad, I went too far e're I was aware: But speak for 
thy self (^Harcourt^) , you said you wou'd not wrong me, nor 
her.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] No, no, Madam, e'n take him for Heaven's sake.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Look you there, Madam.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Who shou'd in all justice be yours, 
he that loves you most. [$ (^Claps his hand on his breast.^) $]
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Look you there, Mr. (^Sparkish^) , who's that?
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Who shou'd it be? go on (^Harcourt^) .
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Who loves you more than Women, Titles, or fortune 
Fools. [$ (^Points at^) Sparkish.$]
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Look you there, he means me stil, for he points at 
me.
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Ridiculous!
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Who can only match your Faith, and constancy in 
love.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Ay.
<P 45>
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Who knows, if it be possible, how to value so much 
beauty and virtue.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Ay.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Whose love can no more be equall'd in the world, 
than that Heavenly form of yours.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] No -- 
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Who cou'd no more suffer a Rival, than your absence, 
and yet cou'd no more suspect your virtue, than his own 
constancy in his love to you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] No --
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Who in fine loves you better than his eyes, that   #
first 
made him love you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Ay -- nay, Madam, faith you shan't go, till -- 
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] Have a care, lest you make me stay too long -- 
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] But till he has saluted you; that I may be assur'd
you are friends, after his honest advice and declaration: Come 
pray, Madam, be friends with him.
[$ (^Enter Master^) Pinchwife, (^Mistriss^) Pinchwife.$]
   [$ (^Alith.^) $] You must pardon me, Sir, that I am not yet so
obedient to you.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] What, invite your Wife to kiss Men? Monstrous,
are you not asham'd? I will never forgive you.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] Are you not asham'd, that I shou'd have more
confidence in the chastity of your Family, than you have; you 
must not teach me, I am a man of honour, Sir, though I am 
frank and free; I am frank, Sir -- 
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Very frank, Sir, to share your Wife with your
friends.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] He is an humble, menial Friend, such as           #
reconciles the 
differences of the Marriage-bed; you know Man and Wife 
do not alwayes agree, I design him for that use, therefore 
wou'd have him well with my Wife.
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] A menial Friend -- you will get a great many
menial Friends, by shewing your Wife as you do.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] What then, it may be I have a pleasure in't, as I #
have 
to shew fine Clothes, at a Play-house the first day, and count 
money before poor Rogues.
<P 46>
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] He that shews his wife, or money will be in
danger of having them borrowed sometimes.
   [$ (^Spar.^) $] I love to be envy'd, and wou'd not marry a Wife, 
that I alone cou'd love; loving alone is as dull, as eating 
alone; is it not a frank age, and I am a frank Person? and to 
tell you the truth, it may be I love to have Rivals in a Wife, 
they make her seem to a Man still, but as a kept Mistriss; and 
so good night, for I must to (^Whitehal^) . Madam, I hope you 
are now reconcil'd to my Friend; and so I wish you a good 
night, Madam, and sleep if you can, for to morrow you know 
I must visit you early with a Canonical Gentleman. Good 
night dear (^Harcourt^) . [$ (^Exit^) Sparkish.$]
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Madam, I hope you will not refuse my visit to 
morrow, if it shou'd be earlyer, with a Canonical Gentleman, 
than Mr. (^Sparkish's^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] This Gentle-woman is yet under my care,
therefore you must yet forbear your freedom 
with her, Sir. [$ (^Coming between^) Alithea (^and^) Harcourt.$]
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Must, Sir -- 
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Yes, Sir, she is my Sister.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] 'Tis well she is, Sir -- for I must be her         #
Servant, Sir. 
Madam -- 
   [$ (^Mr. Pin.^) $] Come away Sister, we had been gone, if it had 
not been for you, and so avoided these lewd Rakehells, who 
seem to haunt us.
