Dauye Thurlowe, beeing
strangely taken and greatly
tormented, Vrsley Kempe

the childe lying vpon a bed in the chimney
corner, shee the said Vrsley tooke it by the hande,
saying,$] A good childe howe art thou loden? [$and
so went thrise out of the doores, and euery time
when shee came in shee tooke the childe by the

loden? [$And so at her departure, the saide Grace
prayed the saide Vrsley to come againe vnto
<P A1V>
her at night to helpe her. And thereupon she
the saide Vrsley replied, and saide,$] I warrant
thee I, thy Childe, shall doe well enough; [$and y=t=
night it fell to rest, the which it did not of a long
time before. And the next day the said Grace
going to mille warde meeting the said Vrsley,
shee asked her howe her childe did, and shee said$]
it tooke good rest this night God be thanked, I
I [$saide the said Vrsley,$] I warrant thee it shall
doe well. [$Note, that the palmes of the childes
handes were turned where the backes shoulde
bee, and the backe in the place of the palmes.$]
   [$The said Grace saith also, that about three
quarters of a yeere agoe she was deliuered of a 
woman childe, and saith, that shortly after the
birth thereof, the said Vrsley fell out with her,
for that shee woulde not suffer her to haue the
nursing of that childe, at suche times as she the
said Grace continued in woorke at the Lorde
Darcies place: And saith, that shee the saide
Grace nursing the said childe, within som short
time after that falling out, the childe lying in
the Cradle, and not aboue a quarter olde, fell
out of the saide Cradle, and brake her necke,
and dyed. The which the saide Vrsley
hearing to haue happened, made answere$] it
maketh no matter. For shee might haue 
<P A2R>
suffered mee to haue the keeping and nursing of it.
   [$And the saide Grace saith, that when shee 
lay in, the saide Vrsley came vnto her, and
seemed to bee very angrie for that shee had not the
keeping in of the saide Grace, & for that she
answered vnto her that shee was prouided: And 
thereupon they entred further into talke, the
saide Grace saying, that if shee should
continue lame as shee had doone before, shee
woulde finde the meanes to knowe howe it
came, and y=t= shee woulde creepe vpon her knees
to complaine of them to haue iustice done vpon

it were a good turne.$] Take heed [$ (said Grace) $]
Vrsley, thou hast a naughtie name. [$And to
that Vrsley made answere, though shee coulde
vnwitche shee coulde not witche, and so
promised the saide Grace, that if shee did sende
for her priuily, and send her keeper away,
that then shee woulde shew the said Grace, how
shee shoulde vnwitch herselfe or any other at
any time.$]
   [$And the said Grace further saith, that about
halfe a yeere past she began to haue a lamenesse
in her bones, & specially in her legges, at which
time y=e= said Vrsley came vnto her vnsent for and
w=t=out [^SOURCE TEXT: wout^] request: And said, she would helpe     #
her of
her lamenes, if she the said Grace woulde giue
<P A2V>
her xii. pence, y=e= which the said Grace speaking
her fayre, promised her so to doe, and thereupon
for the space of v. weekes after, she was wel &
in good case as shee was before. And then
the said Vrsley came vnto the saide Grace, and
asked her y=e= money she promised to her. 
Wherupon the saide Grace made answere, that shee
was a poore and a needie woman, and had no
money: & then the said Vrsley requested of her
cheese for it: but she said she had none. And shee
the said Vrsley, seeing nothing to be had of the
saide Grace, fell out with her, and saide, that she
woulde bee euen with her: and thereupon shee
was taken lame, and from that day to this day
hath so continued.$]
   [$And she saith, that when she is any thing well
or beginneth to amend, then her childe is 
tormented, and so continueth for a time in a very
strange case, and when he beginneth to amend:
Then shee the saide Grace becommeth so lame,
as without helpe shee is not able to arise, or to
turne her in her bed.$]

thinking it might be by some ruggednesse of y=e=
spindle that did cause her thread to breake, and so
<P E8R>
when she had grownd it as wel as she could, she
went againe to worke therewith, thinking that
then it would haue done, but it would not do no 
better then it did before: then she saith, y=t= shee
remembred her self and tooke her spindle and put
it into y=e= fire, & made it red hot, & then cooled it
gaine and went to worke, and then it wrought
as well as euer it did at any time before.$]
   [$This examinat saith, that an other time the
saide Annis Herd owed her two pence, and
the time came that shee shoulde pay the Lordes
rent, and she beeing a poore woman was
constrained to aske her the two pence, and to borow
besides (as shee said): whereto she the saide 
Annis answered, that shee had paied eight or nine 
shillings that weeke, and shee had it not nowe:
saying she should haue it the next weeke, 
whereto shee this Examinat saide,$] you must needes
helpe me with it now, for this day I must paye
the Lordes rent, [$then shee saide shee must goe
borrowe it, and so went and fetched it, saying,$]
there is your money, [$whereunto shee this
examinat answered, and said,$] now I owe you a pint
of milke, come for it when you will & you shall
haue it: [$the which she came for y=e= next day, & had
it with y=e= better, this examinat saith, y=t= y=e= next day
she would haue fleet hir milk bowle, but it wold
not abide y=e= fleeting, but would rop & role as it were
<P E8V>
the white of an egge, also the milk being on the
fier it did not so soone seath but it would quaile,
burne by and stincke, the which shee saide shee
thought might be lo~g of y=e= feeding of her beasts,
or els that her vessels were not sweete,
wherevpon she saith, she scalded her vessels, and
scoured them with salt, thinking that might helpe,
but it was neuer the better but as before: then
she saith, shee was full of care, that shee shoulde
loose both milke and creame, then shee saith it
came into her minde to approoue another way,
which was, shee tooke a horse shue and made it
redde hote, and put it into the milke in the 
vessals, and so into her creame: and then she saith,
shee coulde seath her milke, fleete her creame,
and make her butter in good sort as she had
before.$]
   [$Andrewe West and Anne saith, that on a 
time the said Annis Herd came vnto his house,
saying, she had been at mill, and that she coulde
get neither meale nor bread, at which her
speeches hee knowing her neede, saith, hee caused
his wife to giue her a peece of a lofe: and that
the~ he said vnto her,$] Annis, thou art ill thought
of for witchcraft, [$the which she then vtterly
denyed y=t= she coulde or did any such thing:
whereunto he saith, his wife saide$] wee haue a sort of
pigges I wote not what we shall doe with the~,
<P F1R>
[$saying,$] I woulde some body had one or two of
them, [$to that the said Annis said, that if a poore
body should haue of them and bestow cost, & that
then if they should die it would halfe vndoe the~,
and said if her Landlord would giue her leaue
to keepe one, she the~ wished that she would giue
her one of them, whereunto this examinat said,
shee should haue one: But for that she came not
for it, this examinat saith, that he did thinke that
she cared not for it, and after a while one of her
neighbours bought two of them, and within ii.
or iii. dayes after the said Annis came for one: to
whom this examinat [^SOURCE TEXT: examint^] said, for y=t= they had  #
not hard
no more of her, that he thought she would haue
none, and told her that he had sold two of them,
and so the said Annis departed and went home.$]
   [$This examinat saith, y=t= his wife the next day
sent vnto the said Annis a pound of wooll to be
spun: and that she said to the boy that brought it,
saying,$] can she not haue her weeders to spin the
same? [$and that she then said to y=e= boy,$] your Aunt
might as well giue me one of her pigges, as to
Penly. [$and this examinat saith, that within two
houres after, one of the best pigs that he had fel
vpon a crying as they stood all together before
the dore in the yard, and the rest of the pigs we~t
away from y=t=: at the length the pig that cried
folowed stackering as though it were lame in the
hinder partes, and y=t= then he called his weeders
<P F1V>
to see in what strange case the pig was in, and
asked them what was best to doe therewith, to
which some of them said, burne it, other said, cut
of the eares & burn them, and so they did, & then
the pig amended by & by. and within two daies
after this examinats wife met with the said
Annis Herd, and shee then burdened her with
that she had said to her boy: To the which y=e= said
Annis made answere, y=t= she did say so: and then
this examinats wife told the said Annis in what
case her pig was, saying,$] thou saidest the other
day thou hadst no skill in witcherie, [$his saide
wife then said,$] I will say thou hast an vnhappie
tongue. [$After which, this examinats wife could
not brewe to haue any drinke y=t= was good, so as
she was full of care, saying, y=t= somtimes she put
one thing into her brewing fat, sometimes an
other thing to see if it could doe it any good, but
shee saith, it did none: then she saith one gaue her
counsell to put a hot yron into her mesh fat, the
which she did, and then shee could brewe as well
as she did before.$]
   [$Edmond Osborne and Godlife his wife, said
that a litle before Christmas last past, he bought
at Manitree mault, and brought it home, and
said to his wife,$] good wife, let vs haue good
drinke made of it. [$And the next day shee went in
hand to brew the same, and when she had meshed
her first worte and did let it goe, that did verye
<P F2R>
well: Then his said wife hauing occasion to
send her lad to their ground, she bade the lad call
at Annis Herds for iii. d. the which shee owed
her for a pecke of Aples, and that the lad so did:
And she answered him very short, and saide, shee
had it not now, saying, she shold haue it as soone
as y=e= Wooll ma~ came: and the lad came home, &
tolde his dame what she had said. And at y=t= time,
she this examinat was readie to meshe y=e= seconde
time, & whe~ she had done, her mesh fat wrought
vp as the fat doth when it was set a worke with
good beere, and bare vp a hand breadth aboue y=e=
fat, and as they thrust in a sticke or any
other thing, it would blow vp and then sinked
againe, then she saith, y=t= she did heat an yron redde
hot, and put y=e= same into it, & it rose vp no more.
And then she let goe, and then shee did seath the
wort, and when it was sodden it stancke in suche
sorte, as that they were compelled to put y=e= same
in the swill tubbe.$]
   [$Richard Harrison Clerk, person of Beamo~d
saith, that he and his late wife did dwell at little
Okely, in a house of his said wife, & that hee the
said Richard Harrison had also the personage
of Okeley in farme, and about Sommer was
tweluemonth, he being at London his wife had
a Ducke sitting on certaine egges vnder a 
Cherrie tree in a hedge, and when the saide
<P F2V>
Duck had hatched, his said wife did suspect one
Annis Herd a light woma~, and a common
harlot to haue stolen her duckelins, & that his
said wife went vnto the said Annis Herd &
rated her and all too chid her, but she could get no
knowledge of her ducklins, and so came home &
was very angry against the said Annis. & 
within a short time after, the said Richard Harrison
went into a chamber, and there did reade on his
bookes for the space of 2. or 3. houres bidding
his said wife to goe to bed w=t= the children, and y=t=
he would come to her, and she so did: and being
awhile laid downe in her bed, his wife did crie
out:$] Oh Lord Lorde, helpe me & keepe me, [$and
he running to her, asked her what she ailed? and
she said,$] Oh Lord I am sore afraid, and haue bin
diuers times, but that I would not tell you, [$and
said,$] I am in doubt husband, that yonder wicked
harlot Annis Herd doth bewitch me, [$and y=e= said
Richard, said to his wife,$] I pray you be content
and thinke not so, but trust in God and put your
trust in him onely, and he will defend you from
her, and from the Diuell himselfe also: [$and said
moreouer,$] what will the people say, that I
beeing a Preacher shoulde haue my wife so weake
in faith.
   [$This examinat saith, y=t= within two moneths
after his said wife said vnto him,$] I pray you as
euer there was loue betweene vs, (as I hope
<P F3R>
there hath been for I haue v. pretie children by
you I thanke God) seeke som remedie for me
against yonder wicked beast [$ (meaning the saide
Annis Herd).$] And if you will not I will
complaine to my father, and I thinke he wil see som
remedie for me, for [$ (said she) $] if I haue no
remedie, she will vtterly consume me, [$whereupo~ this
examinat did exhort his said wife as hee had
before, & desired her to pray to God, and y=t= he wold
hang her the said Annis Herd if he could proue
any such matter. and after he went to the
personage, and there he saith he gathered plummes:
and the said Annis Herd then came to the hedge
side and Anwicks wife with her, and said vnto
him,$] I pray you giue me som plummes sir: [$and
this examinat said vnto her,$] I am glad you are
here you vield strumpet, [$saying,$] I do think you
haue bewitched my wife, and as truly as God
doth liue, if I can perceiue y=t= she be troubled any
more as she hath been, I will not leaue a whole 
bone about thee, & besides I will seeke to haue
thee hanged: [$and saith, he saide vnto her that his
wife would make her father priuie vnto it, and
that$] then I warrant thee he will haue you
hanged, for he will make good friends, & is a stout 
man of himselfe. [$and saith, y=t= then he did rehearse
diuers things to her y=t= were thought she had 
bewitched, as Geese & Hogges, & as he was
comming downe out of the tree, shee the said Annis
<P F3V>
did sodenly depart from him without hauing 
any plummes.$]
   [$This examinat saith, after which speeches
so by him vsed vnto her, and before Christmas,
his said wife was take~ sore sick, & was at many 
times afraid both sleeping and waking, & did
call this examinat her husbande vnto her not
aboue two dayes before her death, and saide vnto
him,$] husband, God blesse you and your children,
and God send you good friends, for I must
depart from you, for I am nowe vtterly
consumed with yonder wicked Creature,
[$naming the saide Annis Herd, which wordes hee
saith were spoken by her in y=e= presence of Iohn
Pollin, & mother Poppe, and within two daies
after his said wife departed out of this world in
a perfect faith, she diuers times in her sicknesse
and before, repeating these wordes,$] Oh Annis
Herd, Annis Herd shee hath consumed me.
   [$Iohn Pollin saith, he was at master
Harrisons when his wife lay sicke, & neere y=e=
departing out of this world, & that her husband gaue
her good counsell for her saluation, and that she
then said,$] O Annis Herd, Annis Herd.
