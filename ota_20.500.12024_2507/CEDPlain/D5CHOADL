[$ (^Enter^) RANGER.$]

   Once more I am got safe to the (^Temple^) --
let me reflect a little -- I have set up all
Night. I have my Head full of bad Wine,
and the Noise of Oaths, Dice, and the damn'd
tingling of Tavern Bells; my Spirits jaded,
and my Eyes sunk into my Head: and all this for the
Conversation of a Company of Fellows I despise. Their
Wit lies only in Obscenity, their Mirth in Noise, and
their Delight in a Box and Dice. Honest (^Ranger^) , take
my Word for it, thou art a mighty silly Fellow.

[$ (^Enter^) Servant, (^with a Wig dress'd^) .$]

Where have you been, Rascal? If I had not had the Key
in my Pocket, I must have waited at the Door in this
dainty Dress.
   [$ (^Serv.^) $] I was only below combing out your Honour's 
Wig.
<P 2>
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] [$ (^Pulling off his Wig.^) $] Well, give me my   #
Cap --
Why, how like a raking Dog do you look, compar'd to that
spruce, sober Gentleman -- Go, you batter'd Devil, and be
made fit to be seen.
   [$ (^Serv.^) $] Cod, my Master's very merry this Morning.
[$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] And now for the Law. [$ (^Reads.^) $]
[^SEVEN LINES OF VERSE ABOUT A "FALSE" WOMAN OMITTED.^]
Honest (^Congreve^) was a Man after my own Heart.
[$ (^Enter Servant.^) $]
Have you been for the Money this Morning, as I 
order'd you?
   [$ (^Serv.^) $] No, Sir, you bad me go before you was up --
I did not know your Honour meant before you went to 
Bed.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] None of your Jokes, I pray; but to Business --
Go to the Coffee-house, and enquire if there has been
any Letter or Message left for me.
   [$ (^Serv.^) $] I shall, Sir. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] [^CONTINUES THE VERSE:^] (^You think she's false, #
I am sure she's kind,
I take her Body, you her Mind;
Which has the better Bargain?^)
Oh, that I had such a soft, deceitful Fair to lull my Senses
to their desir'd Sleep -- [$ (^Knocking at the Door.^) $] Come in.
[$ (^Enter^) Simon.$]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Oh, Master (^Simon^) , is it you? How long have
you been in Town?
<P 3>
   [$ (^Simon.^) $] Just come, Sir, and but for a little time 
neither; and yet I have as many Messages as if we were to
stay the whole Year round. Here they are, all of them.
[$ (^Pulls out a Number of Cards.^) $] And among them one
for your Honour.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] [$Reads.$] Clarinda's (^Compliments to her        #
Cousin^)
Ranger, (^and should be glad to see him for ever so little a time
that he can be spar'd from the more weighty Business of the
Law^) . -- Ha! ha! ha! the same merry Girl I ever knew
her.
   [$ (^Simon.^) $] My Lady is never sad, Sir. [$ (^Knocking at the  #
Door.^) $]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Pr'ythee, (^Simon^) , open the Door.
[$ (^Enter Millener.^) $]
Well, Child -- and who are you?
   [$ (^Mille.^) $] Sir, my Mistress gives her Service to you, and
has sent you home the Linnen you bespoke.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Well, (^Simon^) , my Service to your Lady, and
let her know I will most certainly wait upon her -- I am
a little busy, (^Simon^) -- and so --
   [$ (^Simon.^) $] Ah, you're a Wag, Master (^Ranger^) , you're a
Wag -- but Mum for that! [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] I swear, my Dear, you have the prettiest pair of
Eyes -- the loveliest pouting Lips -- I never saw you
before.
   [$ (^Mille.^) $] No, Sir -- I was always in the Shop.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Was you so? Well, and what does your
Mistress say? -- The Devil fetch me, Child, you look'd so
prettily, that I could not mind one Word you said.
   [$ (^Mille.^) $] Lard, Sir, you are such another Gentleman!
Why, she says she is sorry she could not send them sooner.
Shall I lay them down?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] No, Child. Give 'em me! Dear little smiling
Angel -- [$ (^Catches, and kisses her.^) $]
   [$ (^Mille.^) $] I beg, Sir, you would be civil.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Civil? Egad, I think I am very civil.
[$ (^Kisses her again.^) $]
<P 4>
[$ (^Enter Servant, and^) Bellamy.$]
   [$ (^Serv.^) $] Sir, Mr. (^Bellamy^) .
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Damn your Impertinence -- Oh, Mr. (^Bellamy^) ,
your Servant.
   [$ (^Mille.^) $] What shall I say to my Mistress?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Bid her make half a dozen more; but besure
you bring them home yourself. [$ (^Exit^) Millener.$] Pshah!
Pox! Mr. (^Bellamy^) , how should you like to be serv'd so
yourself.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] How can you, (^Ranger^) , for a Minute's Pleasure,
give an innocent Girl the Pain of Heart I am confident
she felt? -- There was a modest Blush upon her Cheek
convinces me she was honest.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] May be so. I was resolv'd to try, however.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Fy, (^Ranger^) , -- will you never think?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Yes, but I can't be always thinking. The Law
is a damnable dry Study, Mr. (^Bellamy^) , and without
something now and then to amuse, and relax, it would be too
much for my Brain, I promise ye -- But I am a mighty
sober Fellow grown -- Here have I been at it these three
Hours -- but the Wenches will never let me alone --
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Three Hours! -- Why, do you usually study in
such Shoes and Stockings?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Rat your inquisitive Eyes. (^ (\Ex pede           #
Herculem.\) ^)
Egad, you have me! The Truth is, I am but this 
Moment return'd from the Tavern. What, (^Frankly^) here too!
[$ (^Enter^) Frankly.$]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] My Boy (^Ranger^) , I am heartily glad to see you.
(^Bellamy^) , let me embrace you. You are the Person I want.
I have been at your Lodgings, and was directed hither.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] It is to him then I am oblig'd for this Visit:
But with all my Heart -- He is the only Man, to whom I
don't care how much I am oblig'd.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Your very humble Servant, Sir.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] You know, (^Ranger^) , I want no Inducement
to be with you. But -- You look sadly -- What -- No
merciless Jade has -- Has she?
<P 5>
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] No, no. Sound as a Roach, my Lad. I only
got a little too much Liquor last Night, which I have not 
slept off yet.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Thus, (^Frankly^) , it is every Day. All the
Morning his Head akes, at Noon he begins to clear up,
towards Evening he is good Company, and all Night he is
carefully providing for the same Course the next Day.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Why, I must own, my ghostly Father, I did
relapse a little last Night, just to furnish out a decent
Confession for the Day.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] And he is now doing Penance for it. Were you
his Confessor indeed, you could not well desire more.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] (^Charles^) , he sets up for a Confessor with the # 
worst
Grace in the World. Here has he been reproving me for
being but decently civil to my Millener. Plague! because
the Coldness of his Constitution makes him insensible of a
fine Woman's Charms, every body else must be so too.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] I am no less sensible of their Charms than you
are; tho' I cannot kiss every Woman I meet, or fall 
in Love, as you call it, with every Face which has
the Bloom of Youth upon it. I would only have you a 
little more frugal of your Pleasures.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] My dear Friend, this is very pretty talking.
But let me tell you, it is in the Power of the very first
Glance from a fine Woman utterly to disconcert all your
Philosophy.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] It must be from a fine Woman then: and not
such as are generally reputed so -- And it must be a
thorough Acquaintance with her too, that will ever make
an Impression on my Heart.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Would I could see it once! For when a Man
has been all his Life hoarding up a Stock, without
allowing himself common Necessaries, it tickles me to the
Soul to see him lay it all out upon a wrong Bottom, and
become a Bankrupt at last.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Well, I don't care how soon you see it. For the
Minute I find a Woman capable of Friendship, Love,
and Tenderness, with Good-sense enough to be always
<P 6>
easy, and Good-nature enough to like me: I will 
immediately put it to the Trial, which of us shall have the
greatest Share of Happiness from the Sex, You or I.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] By marrying her, I suppose! Capable of
Friendship, Love, and Tenderness, ha, ha, ha! That a Man
of your Sense should talk so. If she be capable of Love
'tis all I require of my Mistress; and as every Woman,
who is young, is capable of Love, I am very reasonably
in Love with every young Woman I meet. -- My Lord
(^Coke^) , in a Case I read this very Morning, speaks my very
Sense.
   [$ (^Both.^) $] My Lord (^Coke^) !
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Yes, (^my^) Lord (^Coke^) ! What he says of one 
Woman, I say of the whole Sex. (^I take their Bodies, you
their Minds; which has the better Bargain?^)
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] There is no arguing with so great a Lawyer.
Suppose therefore we adjourn the Debate to some other 
time. I have some serious Business with Mr. (^Bellamy^) ,
and you want Sleep I am sure.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Sleep! mere Loss of Time, and Hindrance of
Business -- We Men of Spirit, Sir, are above it.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Whither shall we go?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Into the (^Park^) . My Chariot is at the Door.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Then if my Servant calls, you'll send him
after us. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] I will. [$ (^Looking on the Card^) $]             # 
(^Clarinda's^)
Compliments [^SOURCE TEXT: Service CORRECTED TO Compliments IN       #
ERRATA^] -- A pox of this Head of mine! Never once to ask
where she was to be found. It's plain she is not one of
us, or I shou'd not have been so remiss in my Inquiries.
-- No matter -- I shall meet her in my Walks.
[$ (^Servant enters.^) $]
   [$ (^Serv.^) $] There is no Letter nor Message, Sir.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Then my Things, to dress. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]

[}SCENE II.}]

[} (^A^) CHAMBER.}]

[$ (^Enter Mrs.^) Strictland, (^and^) Jacintha, (^meeting^) .$]

   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Good-morrow, my dear (^Jacintha^) .
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Good-morrow to you, Madam. I have brought
my Work, and intend to sit with you this Morning. I
hope you have got the better of your Fatigue. Where
is (^Clarinda^) ? I should be glad if she wou'd come, and
work with us.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] She work! she is too fine a Lady to do
any thing. She is not stirring yet -- we must let her have
her Rest. People of her waste of Spirits require more time
to recruit again.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] It is pity she should be ever tir'd with what is
so agreeable to every body else. I am prodigiously pleas'd
with her Company.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] And when you are better acquainted, you
will be still more pleas'd with her. You must rally her
upon her Partner at (^Bath^) : for, I fancy, Part of her Rest
has been disturb'd on his Account.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Was he really a pretty Fellow?
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] That I can't tell. I did not dance myself,
and so did not much mind him. You must have the whole
Story from herself.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Oh, I warrant ye, I get it all out. None are
so proper to make Discoveries in Love as those who are
in the Secret themselves.
[$ (^Enter^) Lucetta.$]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Madam, Mr. (^Strictland^) is inquiring for you.
Here has been Mr. (^Buckle^) with a Letter from his Master,
which has made him very angry.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Mr. (^Bellamy^) said indeed he would try him once
more, but I fear it will prove in vain. Tell your Master
<P 8>
I am here. [$ (^Exit^) Lucetta.$] What signifies Fortune, when
it only makes us Slaves to other People?
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Do not be uneasy, my (^Jacintha^) . You    #
shall
always find a Friend in me: But as for Mr. (^Strictland^) ,
I know not what ill Temper hangs about him lately.
Nothing satisfies him. You saw how he receiv'd us when
we came off our Journey; tho' (^Clarinda^) was so good
Company. He was barely civil to her, and downright rude
to me.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] I cannot help saying I did observe it.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] I saw you did. Hush! he's here.
[$ (^Enter Mr.^) Strictland.$]
    [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Oh, your Servant, Madam! Here, I have
receiv'd a Letter from Mr. (^Bellamy^) , wherein he desires I
would once more hear what he has to say -- You know
my Sentiments -- Nay, so does he.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] For Heaven's sake consider, Sir. This is no new
Affair, no sudden start of Passion -- We have known
each other long. My Father valued and lov'd him, and
I am sure were he alive, I should have his Consent.
    [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Don't tell me. Your Father would not have
you marry against his Will; neither will I, against mine:
I am your Father now.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] And you take a fatherly Care of me.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] I wish I had never had any thing to do
with you
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] You may easily get rid of the Trouble.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] By listening, I suppose, to the young
Gentleman's Proposals.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Which are very reasonable in my Opinion.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Oh, very modest ones truly; and a very
modest Gentleman it is that proposes them! A Fool, to
expect a Lady of Thirty Thousand Pounds Fortune
should, by the Care and Prudence of her Guardian, be
thrown away upon a young Fellow not worth three
Hundred a Year. He thinks being in Love is an Excuse for all
this; but I am not in Love. What does he think will
excuse me?
<P 9>
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Well, but Mr. (^Strictland^) , I think the
Gentleman should be heard.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Well, well! Seven o'Clock's the time, and
if the Man has had the good Fortune, since I saw him last,
to persuade somebody, or other, to give him a better
Estate, I give him my Consent -- not else. His Servant waits
below. You may tell him I shall be at home [$ (^Exit^) Jacin.$]
But where is your Friend, your other Half, all this while?
I thought you could not have breath'd a Minute without
your (^Clarinda^) .
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Why, the Truth is, I was going to see
what makes her keep her Chamber so long.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Look ye, Mrs. (^Strictland^) , you have been
asking me for Money this Morning. In plain Terms, not
one Shilling shall pass through these Fingers till you have
clear'd my House of this (^Clarinda^) .
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] How can her innocent Gaiety have
offended you? She is a Woman of Honour, and has as
many good Qualities --
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] As Women of Honour generally have. I
know it, and therefore am uneasy.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] But, Sir, --
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] But, Madam, -- (^Clarinda^) , nor e'er a Rake
of fashion in (^England^) , shall live in my Family to
debauch it.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Sir, she treated me with so much Civility
in the Country, that I thought I could not do less than
invite her to spend as much time with me in Town, as
her Engagements would permit. I little imagin'd you
could have been displeas'd at my having so agreeable a
Companion.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] There was a Time when I was Company
enough for leisure Hours.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] There was a Time when every Word of
mine was sure of meeting with a Smile: But those happy 
Days, I know not why, have long been over.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] I cannot bear a Rival, even of your own
Sex. I hate the very Name of female Friends. No two
<P 10>
of you can ever be an Hour by yourselves, but one or
both are the worse for it.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Dear Mr. (^Strictland^) --
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] This I know -- and will not suffer.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] It grieves me, Sir, to see you so much in
earnest: But to convince you how willing I am to make
you easy in every thing, it shall be my Request to her to
remove immediately.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Do it then -- hark ye? -- Your Request, why
yours? It's mine. -- My Command -- Tell her so --
I will be Master in my own Family, and I care not who
knows it.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] You fright me, Sir. -- But it shall be as
you please. [$ (^In Tears.^) $] [$ (^Goes out.^) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Ha! have I not gone too far? I am not
Master of myself -- Mrs. (^Strictland^) -- [$ (^She returns.^) $]
Understand me right. I do not mean, by what I have said,
that I suspect your Innocence: But by crushing this
growing Friendship all at once, I may prevent a Train of
Mischief which you do not foresee. I was perhaps too
harsh, therefore do it in your own way -- But let me see
the House fairly rid of her. [$ (^Exit Mr.^) Strictland.$]
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] His Earnestness in this Affair amazes
me. I am sorry I made this Visit to (^Clarinda^) --
and yet I'll answer for her Honour. -- What can I say
to her? Necessity must plead in my Excuse -- For at all
Events, Mr. (^Strictland^) must be obey'd. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

[}SCENE III.}]

[} (^ST.^) JAMES'S PARK.}]

[$ (^Enter^) Bellamy (^and^) Frankly.$]

   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Now, (^Bellamy^) , I may unfold the Secret of my
Heart to you with greater Freedom; for tho' (^Ranger^)
has Honour, I am not in a Humour to be laugh'd at.
I must have one, that will bear with my Impertinence,
<P 11>
sooth me into Hope, and, like a Friend indeed, with
Tenderness advise me.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] I thought you appeared more grave than usual.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Oh! (^Bellamy^) , my Soul is so full of Joy, of
Pain, Hope, Despair, and Extasy, that no Word but
Love is capable of expressing what I feel.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Is Love the Secret (^Ranger^) is not fit to      #
hear?
In my mind, he wou'd prove the more able Counsellor.
And is all the gay Indifference of my Friend at last
reduced to Love?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Even so -- Never was Prude more resolute in
Chastity and Ill-nature, than I was fix'd in Indifference:
But Love has rais'd me from that inactive State above
the Being of a Man.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Faith, (^Charles^) , I begin to think it has --  # 
But
pray, bring this Rapture into order a little, and tell me
regularly, how, where, and when.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] If I was not most unreasonably in Love, those
horrid Questions would stop my Mouth at once. But as
I am arm'd against Reason -- I answer -- at (^Bath^) -- on
(^Tuesday^) , she danced and caught me.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Danced? -- and was that all? But who is
she? What is her Name? her Fortune? where does she
live?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Hold! hold! not so many hard Questions.
Have a little Mercy. I know but little of her, that's
certain. But all I do know you shall have. That Evening
was the first of her appearing at (^Bath^) . The Moment I
saw her I resolved to ask the Favour of her Hand. But
the easy Freedom with which she gave it, and her
unaffected Good-humour during the whole Night, gain'd such
a Power over my Heart, as none of her Sex could ever
boast before. I waited on her home, and the next
Morning, when I went to make the usual Compliments, the
Bird was flown. She had set out for (^London^) two Hours
before; and in a Chariot and Six -- you Rogue.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] But was it her own, (^Charles^) ?
<P 12>
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] That I don't know; but it looks better than
being drag'd to Town in the Stage. That day and the
next I spent in Enquiries. I waited on the Ladies who
came with her. They knew nothing of her. So, without
learning either her Name or Fortune, I e'en call'd for my
Boots, and rode Post after her.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] And how do you find yourself after your
Journey?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Why, as yet, I own, I am but upon a cold
Scent. But a Woman of her Sprightliness and 
Gentility cannot but frequent all publick Places; and when
once she is found, the Pleasure of the Chace will
overpay the Pains of rousing her. -- Oh! (^Bellamy^) , there
was something peculiarly charming in her, that seem'd to
claim my farther Acquaintance: and if in the other more
familiar Parts of Life she shine with that superior Lustre;
and at last I win her to my Arms, how shall I bless my
Resolution in pursuing her!
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] But if at last she should prove unworthy --
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] I would endeavour to forget her.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Promise me that, (^Charles^) , [$ (^Takes his    #
Hand.^) $] and
I allow -- But we are interrupted.
[$ (^Enter^) Jack Meggot.$]
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Whom have we here? my old Friend
(^Frankly^) ? Thou art grown a meer Antique since I saw
thee? How hast thou done these five hundred Years?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Even as you see me; well, and at your
Service, ever.
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Ha! who's that?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] A Friend of mine. Mr. (^Bellamy^) , this is      # 
(^Jacky
Meggot^) , Sir, as honest a Fellow as any in Life.
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Pho! prithee! Pox! (^Charles^) -- Don't
be silly -- Sir, I am your humble -- Any one who is a 
Friend of my (^Frankly's^) I am proud of embracing.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Sir, I shall endeavour to deserve your Civility.
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Oh! Sir, -- Well! (^Charles^) , what? Dumb?
Come, come; you may talk tho' you have nothing to
say, as I do -- Let us hear, where have you been?
<P 13>
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Why, for this last Week, (^Jack^) , I have been at
(^Bath^) .
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] (^Bath^) ! the most ridiculous Place in       #
Life! --
amongst Tradesmens Wives that hate their Husbands,
and People of Quality that had rather go to the
Devil than stay at home. People of no Taste -- no
(^Goust^) -- and for (^ (\Divertimenti\) ^) . If it were not for
the Puppet-show, (^ (\La Virtu\) ^) would be dead amongst
them. -- But the News, (^Charles^) , -- the Ladies, -- I
fear, your Time hung heavy on your Hands, by the small
Stay you made there.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Faith, and so it did, (^Jack^) . The Ladies are
grown such Idiots in Love -- The Cards have so debauch'd
their five Senses, that Love, almighty Love himself, is
utterly neglected.
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] It is the strangest thing in Life, but it is
just so with us abroad. Faith! (^Charles!^) To tell you a
Secret, which I don't care, if all the World knows. I
am almost surfeited with the Services of the Ladies; the
modest ones I mean. The vast Variety of Duties they
expect -- as dressing up to the Fashion, losing
fashionably, keeping fashionable Hours, drinking fashionable
Liquors, and fifty other such irregular Niceties so ruin
a Man's Pocket and Constitution, that foregad! he must
have the Estate of a Duke, and the Strength of a 
Gondolier, who would lift himself into their Service!
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] A free Confession truly, (^Jack^) , for one of   #
your
Coat.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] The Ladies are oblig'd to you.
[$ (^Enter^) Buckle, (^with a Letter to^) Bellamy.$]
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Oh! Lard! (^Charles!^) I have had the
greatest Misfortune in Life, since I saw you -- Poor (^Otho^) !
that I brought from (^Rome^) with me, is dead.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Well! well! get you another, and all will be
well again.
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] No! the Rogue broke me so much (^China^) ,
and gnaw'd [^SOURCE TEXT: knaw'd CORRECTED TO gnaw'd IN ERRATA^] my  #
(^Spanish^) Leather Shoes so filthily, that
when he was dead, I began not to endure him.
<P 14>
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Exactly at Seven! Run back, and assure him I
will not fail. [$ (^Exit^) Buckle.$] Dead? Pray, who was the
Gentleman?
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] This Gentleman was my Monkey, Sir, --
an odd sort of a Fellow that used to divert me, -- and
pleased every body so at (^Rome^) , that he always made one
in our (^ (\Conversationi\) ^) -- But Mr. (^Bellamy^) , I saw a
Servant, I hope no Engagement. For you two positively shall
dine with me. I have the finest (^Macaroni^) in Life. 
Oblige me so far.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Sir -- your Servant! what say you, (^Frankly^) ?
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Pho! Pox! (^Charles^) ! you shall go. My
Aunts think you begin to neglect them; and old Maids,
you know, are the most jealous Creatures in Life.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] (^Ranger^) swears they can't be Maids, they are
so good-natur'd! Well! I agree, on Condition I may
eat what I please, and go away just when I will.
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Ay! ay! you shall do just what you will.
But how shall we do? My Post-Chaise won't carry 
us all.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] My Chariot is here: and I will conduct Mr.
(^Bellamy^) .
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Mr. (^Meggot^) -- I beg pardon, I can't possibly
dine out of Town! I have an Engagement early in the 
Evening. --
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Out of Town! No, my Dear; I live just
by. I see one of the (^ (\Dilettanti\) ^) , I would not miss
speaking to for the Universe. And so I expect you
at Three. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Ha! ha! ha! and so you thought you had at
least fifty Miles to go Post for a Spoonful of (^Macaroni^) .
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] I suppose then, he is just come out of the
Country.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Nor that neither. I would venture a Wager,
from his own House hither; or to an Auction or two of
old dirty Pictures, is the utmost of his Travels to-day:
Or he may have been in Pursuit, perhaps of a new Cargo,
of (^Venetian^) Tooth-picks.
<P 15>
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] A special Acquaintance I have made to-day.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] For all this, (^Bellamy^) , he has a Heart worthy
your Friendship. He spends his Estate freely, and you
cannot oblige him more, than by shewing him how he
can be of Service to you.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Now you say something. It is the Heart,
(^Frankly^) , I value in a Man.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Right! -- and there is a Heart even in a
Woman's Breast that is worth the Purchase, or my
Judgment has deceiv'd me. Dear (^Bellamy^) , I know your
Concern for me. See her first, and then blame me, if
you can.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] So far from blaming you, (^Charles^) , that if my
Endeavours can be serviceable, I will beat the Bushes
with you.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] That I am afraid will not do. For you know
less of her than I. But if in your Walks you meet a finer
Woman than ordinary, let her not escape till I have
seen her. -- Wheresoe'er she is, she cannot long lie hid.

[}ACT II. SCENE I.}]

[} (^ST.^) JAMES'S PARK.}]

[$ (^Enter^) Clarinda, Jacintha (^and Mrs.^) Strictland.$]
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Ay! ay we both stand condemn'd out of our
own Mouths.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Why -- I cannot but own -- I never had a thought
of any Man that troubled me, but of him.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Then I dare swear, by this time, you
heartily repent your leaving (^Bath^) so soon.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Indeed you are mistaken. I have not had one
Scruple since.
<P 16>
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Why, what one Inducement can he have ever
to think of you again?
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Oh! the greatest of all Inducements, Curiosity.
Let me assure you, a Woman's surest Hold over a Man
is to keep him in Incertainty. As soon as ever you put
him out of Doubt, you put him out of your Power:
But when once a Woman has awak'd his Curiosity,
she may lead him a Dance of many a troublesome
Mile without the least Fear of losing him at last.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Now do I heartily wish he may have Spirit
enough to follow, and use you as you deserve. Such a 
Spirit, with but a little Knowledge of our Sex, might put
that Heart of yours into a strange Flutter.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] I care not how soon. I long to meet with such
a Fellow. Our modern Beaux are such jointed Babies
in Love, they have no Feeling. They are entirely 
insensible either of Pain or Pleasure, but from their own dear
Persons: And according as we flatter, or affront their
Beauty, they admire or forsake ours. They are not
worthy even our Displeasure; and, in short, abusing them
is but so much ill-nature merely thrown away. But the
Man of Sense, who values himself upon his high 
Abilities: Or the Man of Wit, who thinks a Woman
beneath his Conversation -- To see such the Subjects of our
Power, the Slaves of our Frowns and Smiles, is glorious
indeed!
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] No Men of Sense, or Wit either, if they
be truly so, ever did, or ever can think a Woman of
Merit beneath their Wisdom to converse with.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Nor will such a Woman value herself upon 
making such a Lover uneasy.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Amazing! Why, every Woman can give Ease?
You cannot be in earnest.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] I can assure you she is, and has put in
practice the Doctrine she has been teaching.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Impossible! Who ever heard the Name of
Love mention'd without an Idea of Torment? But pray
let us hear.
<P 17>
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Nay, there is nothing to hear that I know of.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] So I suspected, indeed! The Novel is not likely
to be long, when the Lady is so well prepar'd for the
(^ (\Denouement\) ^) .
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] The Novel, as you call it, is not so short as
you may imagine. I and my Spark have been long
acquainted. As he was continually with my Father, I soon
perceiv'd he lov'd me, and the Manner of his expressing
that Love was what pleas'd and won me most.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Well! and how was it? The old Bait? Flattery?
Dear Flattery, I warrant ye.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] No, indeed, -- I had not the Pleasure of
hearing my Person, Wit, and Beauty painted out with forced
Praises; but I had a more sensible Delight in perceiving
the Drift of his whole Behaviour was to make ev'ry Hour
of my Time pass away agreably.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] The Rustick! What, did he never say a
handsom thing of your Person?
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] He did, it seems, what pleas'd her better.
He flatter'd her good Sense as much as a less cunning
Lover would have done her Beauty.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] On my Conscience, you are well match'd.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] So well, that if my Guardian denies me
Happiness, (and this Evening he is to pass his final Sentence)
nothing is left but to break my Prison, and fly into my
Lover's Arms for Safety.
   [$ (^Cla.^) $] Hey Day! O' my Conscience thou art a brave
Girl. Thou art the very first Prude, that ever had
Honesty enough to avow her Passion for a Man.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] And thou art the first finish'd Coquet who ever
had any Honesty at all.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Come, come! You are both too good for
either of those Characters.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] And my dear Mrs. (^Strictland^) , here is the first
young married Woman of Spirit, who has an ill-natur'd
Fellow for a Husband, and never once thinks of using him
as he deserves. -- Good Heaven! If I had such a 
Husband --
<P 18>
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] You would be just as unhappy as I am.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] But come now -- Confess -- Do not you long
to be a Widow?
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Would I were any thing but what I am!
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Then go the nearest Way about it. I'd break
that stout Heart of his in less than a Fortnight. I'd make
him know -- 
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Pray be silent. You know my 
Resolution.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] I know you have no Resolution.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] You are a mad Creature, but I forgive
you.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] It is all meant kindly, I assure you. But since
you won't be persuaded to your Good; I will think of
making you easy in your Submission as ever I can,
I dare say, I may have the same Lodging I had last Year.
I can know immediately -- I see my Chair: And so
Ladies both, adieu! [$ (^Exit^) Clarinda.$]
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Come, Mrs. (^Strictland^) , we shall but just    #
have
time to get home before Mr. (^Bellamy^) comes.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Let us return then to our common Prison.
You must forgive my Ill-nature, (^Jacintha^) , if I almost 
wish Mr. (^Strictland^) may refuse to join your Hand where
your Heart is given.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Lord! Madam, what do you mean?
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Self-interest only, Child! Methinks your
Company in the Country would soften all my Sorrows,
and I could bear them patiently.
[$ (^Re-enter^) Clarinda.$]
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Dear Mrs. (^Strictland^) -- I am so confus'd, and
so out of Breath --
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Why, what is the Matter?
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] I protest you fright me.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Oh! I have no time to recover myself, I am so
frighten'd and so pleas'd. In short then, the dear Man
is here?
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Here -- Lord -- Where?
<P 19>
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] I met him this Instant. I saw him at a Distance,
turn'd short; and ran hither directly. Let us go home.
I tell you, he follows me.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Why, had you not better stay, and let 
him speak to you?
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Ay! But -- then -- He won't know where I live,
without my telling him.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Come, then. Ha! ha! ha!
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Ah! Poor (^Clarinda^) ! -- (^ (\Allons donc.\) ^) 
[$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $] 
[$ (^Enter^) Frankly.$]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Sure that must be she! Her Shape and easy
Air cannot be so exactly copied by another. -- Now,
you young Rogue, (^Cupid^) , guide me directly to her, as
you would the surest Arrow in your Quiver. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

[} (^CHANGES TO THE STREET BEFORE MR.^) STRICTLAND'S (^DOOR^) .}]

[$ (^Re-enter^) Clarinda, Jacintha, (^and Mrs.^) Strictland.$]
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Lord! -- Dear (^Jacintha^) -- for Heaven's sake
make haste. He'll overtake us before we get in.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Overtake us? Why, he is not in Sight.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Is not he? Ha! sure I have not dropt my
Twee -- I would not have him lose Sight of me neither.
[$[ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Here he is --
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] In -- In -- In then.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] [$ (^Laughing.^) $] What, without your Twee?
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Pshah! I have lost nothing. -- In -- I'll follow
you. [$ (^Exeunt into the House.^) Clarinda (^last^) .$]
[$ (^Enter^) Frankly.$]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] It is impossible I should be deceiv'd: My Eyes,
and the quick Pulses at my Heart assure me it is she. Ha!

'tis she, by Heaven! and the Door left open too -- A
fair Invitation, by all the Rules of Love -- [$ (^Exit.^) $]

[}SCENE III.}]

[} (^CHANGES TO AN APARTMENT IN MR.^) STRICTLAND'S (^HOUSE^) .}]

[$ (^Enter^) Clarinda, Frankly (^following her^) .$]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] I hope, Madam, you will excuse the Boldness
of this Intrusion, since it is owing to your own Behaviour
that I am forc'd to it.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] To my Behaviour, Sir?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] You cannot but remember me at (^Bath^) , Madam,
where I so lately had the Favour of your Hand --
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] I do remember, Sir; but I little expected any
wrong Interpretation of my Behaviour from one, who
had so much Appearance of a Gentleman.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] What I saw of your Behaviour was so just, it
would admit of no Misinterpretation. I only fear'd, 
whatever Reason you had to conceal your Name from me at
(^Bath^) , you might have the same to do it now; and tho'
my Happiness was so nearly concern'd, I rather chose to
venture thus abruptly after you, than be impertinently
inquisitive.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Sir, there seems to be so much Civility in your
Rudeness, that I can easily forgive it; tho' I don't see
how your Happiness is at all concern'd.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] No, Madam! I believe you are the only Lady,
who could, with the Qualifications you are Mistress of,
be insensible of the Power they give you over the
Happiness of our Sex.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] How vain should we Women be, if you
Gentlemen were but wise! If you did not all of you say the
same things to every Woman, we shou'd certainly be
foolish enough to believe some of you were in earnest.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Could you have the last Sense of what I feel
whilst I am speaking, you would know me to be in
<P 21>
earnest, and what I say to be the Dictates of a Heart that
admires you. May I not say --
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Sir, this is carrying the --
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] When I danced with you at (^Bath^) , I was
charm'd with your whole Behaviour, and felt the same
tender Admiration: But my Hope of seeing you
afterwards kept in my Passion 'till a more proper Time should
offer. You cannot therefore blame me now, if, after
having lost you once, I do not suffer an inexcusable
Modesty to prevent my making use of this second
Opportunity.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] This Behaviour, Sir, is so different from the
Gaiety of your Conversation then, that I am at a loss
how to answer you.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] There is nothing, Madam, which could take
off from the Gaiety with which your Presence inspires 
every Heart, but the Fear of losing you. How can I be
otherwise than as I am, when I know not, but you may
leave (^London^) as abruptly as you did (^Bath^) ?
[$ (^Enter^) Lucetta.$]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Madam, the Tea is ready, and my Mistress
waits for you.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Very well, I come -- [$ (^Exit^) Lucetta.$] You   #
see,
Sir, I am call'd away; but I hope you will excuse it,
when I leave you with an Assurance, that the Business
which brings me to Town will keep me here some time.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] How generous it is in you thus to ease the
Heart, that knew not how to ask for such a Favour -- I
fear to offend -- But this House, I suppose, is yours.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] You will hear of me, if not find me here.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] I then take my Leave. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] I'm undone! -- He has me!
[$ (^Enter Mrs.^) Strictland.$]
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Well! How do you find yourself?
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] I do find -- that if he goes on, as he has begun,
I shall certainly have him without giving him the least
Uneasiness.
<P 22>
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] A very terrible Prospect, indeed!
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] But I must teize him a little. -- Where is
(^Jacintha^) ? How will she laugh at me, if I become a Pupil
of hers, and learn to give Ease? No! positively I shall
never do it.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Poor (^Jacintha^) has met with what I      #
fear'd,
from Mr. (^Strictland's^) Temper -- An utter Denial. I
know not why, but he really grows more and more
ill-natur'd.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Well! now do I heartily wish my Affairs were
in his Power a little, that I might have a few Difficulties
to surmount. -- I love Difficulties -- and yet, I don't
know, it is as well as it is.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Ha, ha, ha! Come, the Tea waits.
[$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
[$ (^Enter Mr.^) Strictland.$]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] These Doings in my House distract
me! I met a fine Gentleman -- when I inquir'd who he
was; why, he came to (^Clarinda^) . I met a Footman too,
and he came to (^Clarinda^) . I shall not be easy till she is
decamp'd. My Wife had the Character of a virtuous
Woman -- and they have not been long acquainted. But
then they were by themselves at (^Bath^) ! That hurts -- that
hurts. -- They must be watch'd -- they must -- I know
them, I know all their Wiles, and the best of them are
but Hypocrites. Ha! -- [$Lucetta (^passes over the Stage^) .$]
Suppose I bribe the Maid -- She is of their Counsel -- The
Manager of their Secrets -- It shall be so -- Money will
do it, and I shall know all that passes. (^Lucetta!^)
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Sir.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] (^Lucetta!^)
[$ (^Re-enter^) Lucetta.$]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Sir. If he should suspect, and search me now,
I'm undone. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] She is a sly Girl, and may be serviceable.
[$ (^Aside.^) $]
<P 23>
(^Lucetta^) , you are a good Girl, and have an honest Face. I
like it. It looks as if it carried no Deceit in it -- Yet if
she should be false, she can do me most harm. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Lucet^) $] Pray, Sir, speak out.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] No! she is a Woman, and it #
is
the highest Imprudence to trust her.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] I am not able to understand you.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] I am glad of it. I would not have you
understand me.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Then what did you call me for? If he should
be in Love with my Face, it would be rare Sport. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] [$ (^Aside^) $] (^Tester^) , ay, (^Tester^) #
is the proper 
Person -- (^Lucetta^) , tell (^Tester^) I want him.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Yes, Sir. -- [$ (^Aside.^) $] Mighty odd, this! It
gives me time however to send (^Buckle^) with this Letter to
his Master. [$ (^Exit^) Lucetta.$]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Could I but be once well satisfied that my
Wife had really finish'd me, I believe I should be as
quiet, as if I were sure of the contrary. -- But whilst I
am in doubt, I am miserable.
[$ (^Enter^) Tester.$]
   [$ (^Tester.^) $] Does your Honour please to want me?
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Ay, (^Tester^) . -- I need not fear. The
Honesty of his Service and the Goodness of his Look
make me secure. I will trust him. [$ (^Aside.^) $] -- (^Tester^) , I
think I have been a tolerable good Master to you.
   [$ (^Tester.^) $] Yes, Sir, -- very tolerable.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] [$ (^Aside^) $] I like his Simplicity well. #
It
promises Honesty -- I have a Secret, (^Tester^) , to impart to you --
A thing of the greatest Importance. Look upon me, and
don't stand picking your Fingers.
   [$ (^Tester.^) $] Yes, Sir. -- No, Sir.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] But will not his Simplicity expose him the
more to (^Lucetta's^) Cunning? Yes, yes! she will worm the
Secret out of him. I had better trust her with it at once.
-- So -- I will. [$ (^Aside.^) $] (^Tester^) , go, send (^Lucetta^)  #
hither.
   [$ (^Tester.^) $] Yes, Sir. -- Here she is.
<P 24>
[$ (^Re-enter^) Lucetta.$]
(^Lucetta^) , my Master wants you.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Get you down, (^Tester^) .
   [$ (^Tester.^) $] Yes, Sir. [$ (^Exit^) Tester.$]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] If you want me, Sir, I beg you would make
haste, for I have a thousand things to do.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Well! well! What I have to say will not
take up much time, could I but persuade you to be honest.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Why, Sir, I hope you don't suspect my 
Honesty?
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Well! well! I believe you honest.
[$ (^Shuts the Door.^) $]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] What can be at the bottom of all this?           #
[$ [(^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] So! We cannot be too private. Come
hither, Hussy! nearer yet.  
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Laud! Sir! You are not going to be rude. I
vow, I will call out.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Hold your Tongue. Does the Baggage
laugh at me? [$ (^Aside.^) $] She does -- She mocks me, and
will reveal it to my Wife; and her Insolence upon it
will be more insupportable to me than Cuckoldom itself.
I have not Leisure now, (^Lucetta^) -- Some other time --
Hush! Did not the Bell ring? Yes, yes; my Wife wants
you. Go, go, go to her. [$ (^Pushes her out.^) $] There is no 
Hell on Earth like being a Slave to Suspicion. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

any Confusion.
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] None in Life, my Dear, I assure you. I
will go and order every thing this Instant for her
Reception.
<P 25>
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] You are too obliging, Sir; but you need not be in 
this hurry, for I am in no Certainty when I shall trouble 
you: I only know that my (^Jacintha^) has taken such a
Resolution.
   [$ (^Jack Meg.^) $] Therefore we should be prepar'd; for when
once a Lady has such a Resolution in her Head, she is
upon the rack till she executes it, foregad! Mr. (^Bellamy^) ,
this must be a Girl of Fire.

   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Even so, Gentlemen, as mad as Love and Joy
can make me.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] But inform us whence this Joy proceeds.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Joy! Joy! my Lads! She's found! My

I think. -- But who is she?
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Come, come, tell us, who is this Wonder?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] But will you say nothing?
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Nothing, as I live.

I am.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] I shew my Heart is capable of Love, by the
Friendship it bears to you.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] The Light of Friendship looks but dim before
the brighter Flame of Love. Love is the Spring of 
Chearfulness and Joy. Why, how dull and phlegmatick
do you shew to me now? Whilst I am all Life; light
as feather'd (^Mercury^) . -- You dull, and cold as Earth and
Water; I light and warm as Air and Fire. -- Those are

say now, if I really were in Love?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Why, faith, thou hast such romantick Notions
of Sense and Honour, that I know not what to say.

Proclaim it loud. -- Glory in it -- Boast of it as your
greatest Virtue. -- Swear it with a Lover's Oath, and
I will believe you.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Why then, by the bright Eyes of her I love?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Well said!
<P 27>
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] By all that's tender, amiable, and soft in
Woman --
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Bravo!
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] I swear, I am as true an (^ (\Enamorato\) ^) as 
ever tagg'd
a Rhyme.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] And art thou then thoroughly in Love? Come
to my Arms, thou dear Companion of my Joys --
[$ (^They embrace.^) $]
[$ (^Enter^) Ranger.$]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Why -- Hey! -- Is there never a Wench
to be got for Love or Money?
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Pshah! (^Ranger^) here!
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Yes, (^Ranger^) is here, and perhaps does not
come so impertinently as you may imagine. Faith! I
think I have the knack of finding out Secrets. Nay,
never look so queer -- Here is a Letter, Mr. (^Bellamy^) , that
seems to promise you better Diversion than your hugging
one another.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] What do you mean?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Do you deal much in these Paper Tokens?
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Oh! the dear kind Creature! It is from her
herself.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] What, is it a Pair of lac'd Shoes she wants? Or
have the Boys broke her Windows?
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Hold your prophane Tongue!
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Nay, prithee (^Bellamy^) , don't keep it to 
yourself, as if her whole Affections were contain'd in these few
Lines.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Prithee, let him alone to his silent Raptures: But
it is, as I always said -- Your grave Men ever are the
greatest Whore-masters.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] I cannot be disoblig'd now, say what you will.
But how came this into your Hands?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Your Servant (^Buckle^) and I chang'd
Commissions. He went on my Errand, and I came on his.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] S'death! I want him this very Instant.
<P 28>
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] He will be here presently! But I demand to
know what I have brought you?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Ay! ay! Out with it! You know we never
blab, and may be of Service.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Twelve o'Clock! oh! the dear Hour.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Why, it is a pretty convenient Time, indeed.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] By all that's happy, she promises in this Letter
here -- to leave her Guardian this very Night -- and
run away with me.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] How is this?
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Nay, I know not how myself -- she says at the
Bottom -- (^Your Servant has full Instructions from^) Lucetta,
(^how to equip me for my Expedition -- I will not trust 
myself home with you to-night, because I know it is 
inconvenient; therefore I beg you wou'd procure me a 
Lodging; it is no matter how far off my Guardians -- Yours^) ,
Jacintha.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Carry her to a Bagnio, and there you may lodge
with her.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Why, this must be a Girl of Spirit, Faith!
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] And Beauty equal to her Sprightliness. I love
her, and she loves me -- She has thirty Thousand to
her Fortune.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] The Devil she has!
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] And never plays at Cards. --
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Nor does any one thing like any one other
Woman, I suppose.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Not so, I hope, neither.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Oh! (^Frankly^) , (^Ranger^) , I never felt such #
Ease 
before. The Secret's out, and you don't laugh at me.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Laugh at thee? -- for loving a Woman of thirty
thousand Pound? Thou art a most unaccountable Fellow.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] How the Devil could he work her up to this? I
never could have had the Face to have done it. But -- 
I know not how. -- There is a Degree of Assurance
in you modest Gentlemen, which we impudent Fellows
never can come up to --
<P 29>
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Oh! your Servant, good Sir; you should not
abuse me now, (^Ranger^) , but do all you can to assist me.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Why, look ye, (^Bellamy^) , I am a damnable
unlucky Fellow -- and so will have nothing to do in this
Affair. I'll take care to be out of the way, so as to do
you no harm. That is all I can answer for, and so Success
attend you. [$ (^Going.^) $] I cannot leave you, quite to
yourself neither, for if this should prove a Round-house Affair,
as I make no doubt it will, I believe I may have more 
Interest there than you; and so, Sir, you may hear of me
at -- [$ (^Whispers.^) $]
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] For shame, (^Ranger^) , the most noted 
Gaming-house in Town.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Forgive me this once, my Boy. I must go,
Faith, to pay a Debt of Honour to some of the greatest
Rascals in the Nation. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] But where do you design to lodge her?
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] At Mr. (^Meggot's^) -- He is already gone to
prepare for her Reception.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] The properest Place in the World. His Aunts
will entertain her with Honour.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] And the Newness of our Acquaintance will 
prevent its being suspected. -- (^Frankly^) , give me your Hand.
This is a very critical Time --
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Pho! none of your musty Reflexions now!
When a Man is in Love to the very Brink of Matrimony,
what the Devil has he to do with (^Plutarch^) and (^Seneca^) ?
Here is your Servant with a Face full of Business -- I'll
leave you together -- I shall be at the (^King's Arms^) , where,
if you want my Assistance, you may find me. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
[$ (^Enter^) Buckle.$]
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] So -- Buckle -- you seem to have your Hands
full.
   [$ (^Buck.^) $] Not fuller than my Head, Sir, I promise you.
You have had your Letter, I hope.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Yes, and in it she refers me to you for my
Instructions.
<P 30>
   [$ (^Buck.^) $] Why, the Affair stands thus -- As Mr. 
(^Strictland^) sees the Doors lock'd and barr'd every Night
himself, and takes the Keys up with him; it is impossible
for us to escape any way but thro' the Window: for
which Purpose I have a Ladder of Ropes.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Good --
   [$ (^Buck^) $] And because a Hoop, as the Ladies wear them
now, is not the most decent Dress to come down a
Ladder in -- I have in this other Bundle a Suit of Boys
Cloaths, which I believe will fit her. At least, it will serve
the Time she will want it -- You will soon be for 
pulling them off, I suppose.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Why, you are in Spirits, you Rogue.
   [$ (^Buck.^) $] These I am now to convey to (^Lucetta^) -- Have
you any thing to say, Sir?
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Nothing, but that I will not fail at the Hour
appointed -- Bring me word to Mr. (^Meggot's^) how you
go on. Succeed in this, and it shall make your Fortune.

   [$ (^Bella.^) $] How tediously have the Minutes past these last
few Hours! and the envious Rogues will fly,
no Lightning quicker, when we would have them stay. --
Hold! let me not mistake. -- This is the House. [$ (^Pulls
out his Watch.^) $] By Heaven! it is not yet the Hour --
I hear somebody coming. The Moon's so bright -- I
had better not be here, 'till the happy Instant comes.
[$ (^Exit.^) $]
<P 31>
[$ (^Enter^) Frankly.$]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Wine is no Antidote to Love, but rather feeds
the Flame. Now am I such an amorous Puppy, that I
cannot walk straight Home, but must come out of my way
to take a View of my Queen's Palace by Moon-light. --
Ay, here stands the Temple where my Goddess is adored!
the Door opens! [$ (^Retires.^) $]
[$ (^Enter^) Lucetta.$]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] [$ (^Under the Window.^) $] Madam, Madam, hist!
Madam -- How shall I make her hear? --
[$Jacintha (^in Boys Cloaths at the Window.^) $]
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Who is there? -- What's the Matter? --
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] It is I, Madam. You must not pretend to stir
'till I give the Word -- You'll be discover'd if you do. --
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] What do I see! a Man. My Heart
misgives me! --
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] My Master is below sitting up for Mrs.           #
(^Clarinda^) .
He raves as if he was mad about her being out so late.
   [$ (^Frankly.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] Here is some Intrigue, or     #
other. I
must see more of this, before I give further way to Love.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] One Minute he is in the Street -- the next he is
in the Kitchen. Now he will lock her out, and then he'll 
wait himself, and see what Figure she makes when she
vouchsafes to venture home.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] I long to have it over. Get me but once out
of this House!
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] Cowardly Rascal! Would I were in 
his Place.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] If I can but fix him any where, I can let you
out myself. -- You have the Ladder ready in Case of
Necessity.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Yes! yes! [$ (^Exit^) Lucetta.$]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] The Ladder! This must lead to   #
some
Discovery. I shall watch you, my young Gentleman.
I shall.
<P 32>
[$ (^Enter^) Clarinda, (^and Servant^) .$]
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] This Whisk is a most enticing Devil. I am
afraid I am too late for Mr. (^Strictland's^) sober Hours.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Ha! I hear a Noise!
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] No! I see a Light in (^Jacintha's^) Window. You
may go home. [$ (^Giving the Servant Money.^) $] I am safe.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Sure it must be he! Mr. (^Bellamy.^) -- Sir!
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] [$ (^Aside^) $] Does not he call to me?
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] Ha! who's that? I am frighted    #
out of
my Wits. -- A Man! --
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Is it you?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Yes! yes! 'tis I! 'tis I!
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Listen at the Door.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] I will, 'tis open -- There is no Noise -- All's
quiet.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Sure it is my Spark -- and talking to             #
(^Jacintha^) .
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] You may come down the Ladder -- quick.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Catch it then; and hold it.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] I have it. Now I shall see what sort of 
Mettle my young Spark is made of. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] With a Ladder too! I'll assure you. But I must
see the end of it. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Hark! did not somebody speak!
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] No! no! Be not fearful -- 'Sdeath! we are 
discover'd. [$Frankly (^and^) Clarinda (^retire^) .$]
[$ (^Enter^) Lucetta.$]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Hist! hist! are you ready?
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Yes, may I venture?
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Now is your Time. He is in high Conference
with his Privy-Counsellor Mr. (^Tester^) . You may come
down the Back Stairs, and I'll let you out. [$ (^Exit^) Lucet.$]
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] I will, I will, and am heartily glad of it.
[$ (^Exit^) Jacintha.$]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] [$ (^Advancing^) $] May be so -- But you and I   #
shall
have a few Words before you get off so cleanly.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] [$ (^Advancing.^) $] How lucky it was I came home
<P 33>
at this Instant. I shall spoil his Sport, I believe. Do
you know me, Sir?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] I am amaz'd! You here! This was 
unexpected indeed!
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Why, I believe I do come a little unexpectedly;
 but I shall amaze you more -- I know the whole Course
of your Amour; all the Process of your mighty Passion
from its first Rise --
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] What is all this! --
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] To the very Conclusion, which you vainly hope
to effect this Night.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] By Heaven, Madam, I know not what you
mean. I came hither purely to contemplate on your
Beauties.
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Any Beauties, Sir, I find will serve your Turn.
Did I not hear you talk to her at the Window?
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Her!
   [$ (^Clar.^) $] Blush, blush for Shame; but be assur'd you have
seen the last both of (^Jacintha^) and me. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] (^Jacintha!^) Hear me, Madam --  She is gone.
This must certainly be (^Bellamy's^) Mistress, and I have
fairly ruin'd all his Scheme. This it is to be in Luck.
[$ (^Enter^) Bellamy, (^behind^) .$]
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Ha! A Man under the Window!
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] No, here she comes, and I may convey her to
him.
[$ (^Enter^) Jacintha, (^and runs to^) Frankly.$]
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] I have at last got to you: Let's haste away --
Oh!
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Be not frighten'd, Lady.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Oh! I am abus'd, betray'd!
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] Betray'd! (^Frankly!^)
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] (^Bellamy.^)
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] I can scarce believe it, tho' I see it. Draw --
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Hear me, (^Bellamy^) -- Lady.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Stay -- do not fight.
   [$ (^Frank.^) $] I am innocent; it is all a Mistake.
<P 34>
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] For my Sake, be quiet -- We shall be discover'd.
The Family is alarm'd.
   [$ (^Bella.^) $] You are obey'd -- Mr. (^Frankly^) , there is but #
one

   [$ (^Frank.^) $] I understand you. Any time but now. You

   [$ (^Frank.^) $] Then, when he is cool, I may be heard; and
the real, tho' suspicious Account of this Matter may be
believ'd. Yet amidst all this Perplexity, it pleases me to
find my fair (^ (\incognita\) ^) is jealous of my Love.

[$ (^Enter Mrs.^) Strictland, (^follow'd by^) Lucetta.$]
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Well! I am in great Hopes she will
escape.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Never fear, Madam. The Lovers have the
start of him, and I warrant, they keep it
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Were Mr. (^Strictland^) ever to suspect my
being privy to her Flight, I know not what might be the
Consequence.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Then you had better be undressing -- He may
return immediately.--
[$ (^As she is sitting down to the Toilet^) , Ranger (^enters        #
behind^) .$] 
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Young and beautiful.-- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] I have watch'd him pretty narrowly of late,
and never once suspected till this Morning --
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] And who gave you Authority to watch
his Actions, or pry into his Secrets?
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] I hope, Madam, you are not angry. I thought
it might have been of Service to you to know my Master
was jealous.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] And her Husband jealous! If she does but send
away the Maid, I am happy.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] [$ (^Angrily.^) $] Leave me!
<P 36>
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] This is to meddle with other Peoples Affairs.
[$ (^Exit in Anger.^) $]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] What a lucky Dog I am! I never made a
Gentleman a Cuckold before. Now, Impudence, assist me.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] [$ (^Rising^) $] Provoking! I am sure I    #
never
have deserv'd it of him.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Oh! Cuckold him by all means, Madam, I am
your Man! [$ (^She shrieks.^) $] Oh, fy, Madam! If you
squawl so cursedly, you will be discover'd.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Discover'd! What mean you, Sir? Do
you come to abuse me?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] I'll do my Endeavours, Madam: You can
have no more.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Whence came you? How got you here?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Dear Madam, so long as I am here, what
signifies how I got here, or whence I came? But that I may
satisfy your Curiosity. First, as to your whence came you?
I answer, out of the Street: And to your How got
you here? I say, in at the Window. It stood so 
invitingly open, it was irresistible. But, Madam -- You
was going to undress. I beg I may not incommode you.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] This is the most consummate Piece of
Impudence! --
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] For Heaven's sake, have one Drop of Pity for
a poor young Fellow, who long has lov'd you.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] What would the Fellow have?
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Your Husband's Usage will excuse you to the
World.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] I cannot bear this Insolence! Help! help!
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Oh! hold that clamorous Tongue! Madam,
speak one Word more, and I am gone, positively gone?
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Gone! So I would have you.
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Lord! Madam, you are so hasty.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Shall I not speak, when a Thief, a
Robber breaks into my House at Midnight? Help! help!
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] Ha! no one hears. Now, (^Cupid^) , assist me!
Look ye, Madam, I never could make fine Speeches, and
cringe, and bow, and fawn, and flatter, and lye. I have
<P 37>
said more to you already, than I ever said to a Woman
in such Circumstances in all my Life. But since I find
you will yield to no Persuasion to your Good -- I will
gently force you to be grateful. [$ (^Throws down his Hat, 
and seizes her.^) $] Come, come! unbend that Brow, and
look more kindly on me!
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] For Shame, Sir -- Thus on my Knees,
let me beg for Mercy. [$ (^Kneeling.^) $]
   [$ (^Rang.^) $] And thus, on mine, let me beg the same.
[$ (^He kneels, catches, and kisses her.^) $]

I am undone, if he sees you.

Way?

   [$ (^Rang.^) $] And so into the Street. With all my Heart.
You may be perfectly easy, Madam. Mum's the Word.
I never blab. -- [$ (^Aside.^) $] I shall never leave off so, but
wait till the last Moment. [$ (^Exit^) Ranger.$]

if he had been discover'd!
[$ (^Enter^) Mr. Strictland, (^driving in^) Jacintha,

   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Once more, my pretty masculine Madam,
you are welcome home. And I hope to keep you
somewhat closer than I have done: for to-morrow Morning,
eight o'Clock, is the latest Hour you shall stay in this
lewd Town.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Oh, Sir! when once a Girl is equip'd with a
hearty Resolution, it is not your Worship's Sagacity, nor
<P 38>
the great Chain at your Gate can hinder her from doing
what she has a Mind.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Oh, Lord! Lord! How this Love
improves a young Lady's Modesty!
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Am I to blame to seek for Happiness any
where, when you are resolv'd to make me miserable
here!
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] I have this Night prevented your making
yourself so; and will endeavour to do it for the future.
I have you safe now, and the Devil shall not get you out
of my Clutches again. I have lock'd the Doors and barr'd
them, I warrant you. So, here -- [$ (^Giving her a Candle.^) $]
Troop to your Chamber, and to Bed, whilst you are well.
Go -- [$ (^He treads on^) Ranger's (^Hat^) .$] What's here? a Hat!
A Man's Hat in my Wife's Dressing-Room!

   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] What shall I do?
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] [$ (^Taking up the Hat, and looking at Mrs.^)

   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] My Fears confound me. I dare not tell
the Truth, and know not how to frame a Lye!
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Mrs. (^Strictland^) ! Mrs. (^Strictland^) ! #
How
came this Hat into your Chamber!
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] [$ (^Aside.^) $] Are you that way dispos'd, my   #
fine
Lady, and will not trust me?
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Speak, Wretch, speak. --
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] I could not have suspected this. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Why dost thou not speak?
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Sir --
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Guilt -- 'tis Guilt that ties your Tongue!
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] I must bring her off, however. -- No 
Chambermaid can help it. -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] My Fears are just, and I am miserable --
Thou worst of Women!
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] I know my Innocence, and can bear this no 
longer.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] I know you are false, -- and 'tis I who will
bear my Injuries no longer. [$ (^Both walk about in a Passion.^) $]
<P 39>

yours? Own
it, Madam. [$ (^Takes away^) Jacintha's (^Hat, and Exit^) .$]
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] What Ground? what Cause have you for
Jealousy, when you yourself can witness, your
leaving me was accidental; your Return uncertain; and
expected even sooner than it happen'd? The Abuse is gross
and palpable.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Why, this is true!
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Indeed, (^Jacintha^) , I am innocent.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] And yet this Hat must belong to
somebody.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Dear Mrs. (^Strictland^) , be not concern'd when #
he
has diverted himself a little longer with it --
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Ha! --
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] I suppose he will give me my Hat again?
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Your Hat?
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Yes, my Hat. You brush'd it from my Side
yourself, and then trod upon it; whether on purpose to
abuse this Lady, or no, you best know yourself.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] It cannot be -- It's all a Lye.
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Believe so still -- with all my Heart -- But the
Hat is mine.
[$ (^Snatches it, and puts it on.^) $]
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Why did she look so?
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Your Violence of Temper is too much for her.
You use her Ill, and then suspect her for that Confusion
which you yourself occasion.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Why, did not you set me right at first?
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Your hard Usage of me, Sir, is a sufficient 
Reason why I should not be much concern'd to undeceive you
at all. 'Tis for your Lady's sake, I do it now; who
deserves much better of you than to be thus expos'd for
every slight Suspicion. See where she sits -- Go to her.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] [$ (^Rising.^) $] Indeed, Mr.              #
(^Strictland^) , I have
a Soul as much above --
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Whew! now you have both found your
Tongues, and I must bear their eternal Rattle!
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] For Shame! Sir, Go to her, and --
<P 40>
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Well! well! what shall I say? I forgive --
all is over. I, I, I forgive!
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Forgive? What do you mean?
   [$ (^Jacin.^) $] Forgive her? is that all? Consider, Sir --
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Hold -- hold your confounded Tongues,
and I'll do any thing. I'll ask Pardon -- or forgive -- or
any thing. Good now, be quiet -- I ask your Pardon --
there -- [$ (^Kisses her.^) $] For you, Madam -- I am
infinitely oblig'd to you, and I could find in my Heart to
make you a Return in kind, by marrying you to a 
Beggar, -- but I have more Conscience. Come, come; to
your Chamber. -- Here, take this Candle -
[$ (^Enter^) Lucetta (^pertly^) .$]
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Sir, if you please, I will light my young Lady
to Bed.
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] No! no! no such thing, good Madam.
She shall have nothing but her Pillow to consult this
Night, I assure you. -- So, in, in. [$ (^The Ladies take leave.^) $]
[$ (^Exit^) Jacintha.$] Good Night, kind Madam.
   [$ (^Lucet.^) $] Pox of the jealous Fool! We might both have
escap'd out of the Window purely. [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] Go, get you down; and, do you hear?
order the Coach to be ready in the Morning at Eight
exactly. [$ (^Exit^) Lucetta.$] [$ (^Locks the Door after her.^) $] So
she is safe till to-morrow, and then for the Country;
and when she is there, I can manage as I think fit.
   [$ (^Mrs. Strict.^) $] Dear Mr. (^Strictland^) --
   [$ (^Mr. Strict.^) $] I am not in a Humour, Mrs. (^Strictland^) ,
fit to talk with you. -- Go to Bed, I will endeavour to
get the better of my Temper, if I can -- I'll follow
you! [$ (^Exit Mrs.^) Strictland.$] How despicable have I
made myself! [$ (^Exit.^) $]
