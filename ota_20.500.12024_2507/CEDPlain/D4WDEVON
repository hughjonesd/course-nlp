great Pains in her Head and all her Limbs, which Pains

aforesaid Widow, and she the said (^Temperance^) did then
and there fall down on her Knees to this Informant, and
wept, (saying) $] Mrs. (^Grace^) , I am glad to see you so strong
again.
   [$Upon which this Informant said,$] Why dost thou weep

weep for Joy to see you so well again, [$as the said
(^Temperance^) then pretended.$]
   [$This Informant further saith, That in that very night
she this Informant was taken very ill with sticking and

compute to be about two hours).$]

was again pinch'd and prick'd to the Heart, with such
cruel thrusting pains in her Head, Shoulders, Arms, Hands,

Fingers and Thumbs.$]

over her Bed, and lay in this condition for the space of
