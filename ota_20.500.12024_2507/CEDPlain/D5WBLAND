<S SAMPLE 1>
<P 6C2>
[^THE WITNESS HAS DESCRIBED MR. BLANDY'S SYMPTOMS 
AND HOW ARSENIC WAS FOUND IN THE GRUEL.^]
   [$Dr. (^Addington^) further deposed, that
Mr. (^Blandy^) told him, that he suspected
he had taken Poison, and that he believed
it came to his Daughter with the (^Scotch^)
Pebbles, for he was always worse after a
Present of those damned (^Scotch^) Pebbles
were received, and besides, that he
remembered to have heard (^Cranston^) talk
very learnedly upon Poisons; that when
he, this Witness, asked Mr. (^Blandy^) who
he imagined gave him this Poison, he
replied, with Tears in his Eyes, though
with a forced Smile,$] (^A poor Love-sick
Girl, but I forgive her^) .
   [$He was then asked by the King's
Council, if he was sure that the Poison
the Deceased had taken, was the Cause
of his Death; Dr. (^Addington^) replied, he
was sure that it was.$]
[^TESTIMONY OF DR. LEWIS OMITTED.^]
   [$ (^Benjamin Norton^) , Apothecary, at
(^Henley upon Thames^) , deposed, That he was
called to Mr. (^Blandy, Tuesday August^) 6th. and
found him complaining of a violent Pain
in his Stomach and Bowles, attended
with a violent Purging and Vomiting;
that on the (^Thursday^) Morning following
(^Susannah Gunnell^) sent to him, and said she
<P 7C1>
should be glad to consult about some
Water-Gruel which she had left with Mrs.
(^Mountney^) , which was the Remainder of what
Mr. (^Blandy^) her Master had eat part of;
that he went and examin'd it, and
being ask'd by them, if he knew what it
was that was in it, he answer'd them,
he could not be very possitive; but let
it be what it would, he was sure it could
not have any Business there; that he
took it from the Gruel upon some white
Paper, and left it with Mrs. (^Mountney^) to
dry; that when it was dry, he burnt
Part of it with a hot Poker, and said it
appear'd to him to be of the Arsnic Kind;
and that another Part of it he had
deliver'd to Dr. (^Addington^) ; and the
Remainder he produc'd in Court, seal'd up
under the Seals of the Earl of
(^Macclesfield^) and Lord (^Cadagan^) .$]
[^CROSS-EXAMINATION OMITTED.^]
<P 7C2>
   [$ (^Mary Mountney^) being sworn, said, That
on the 8th of (^August^) last, (^Susannah
Gunnell^) came to her House, and brought a
Pan with some Gruel in it, and desired
this Witness to look at it, for she
feared there was something in it that should
not be; that upon this Witness's
looking at it, she was of the same Opinion;
that (^Gunnell^) left the Pan with the Gruel
in it with her, desiring this Witness to
shew it to Mr. (^Norton^) the Apothecary,
and desire his Opinion of it; that this
Witness did shew it to Mr. (^Norton^) ,
who inspected it, and said, (^that
whatever it was, it had no Business there^) ; that
Mr. (^Norton^) desired some white Paper,
which she gave him; that then Mr.
(^Norton^) took the Sedement at the Bottom,
put it on the Paper, and gave it to this
Witness to keep till it was dry; that
then this Witness locked it up, till the
11th of the same Month, and then
deliver'd it to Mr. (^Norton^) .$]
[^CROSS-EXAMINATION OMITTED.^]
<P 8C1>
   [$ (^Susannah Gunnell^) , the Chamber-maid,
being call'd and sworn, said, That on
(^Monday^) the 5th of (^August^) last her
Master was not very well, and desired to
have some Water-gruel before he laid
down; that Miss (^Blandy^) , the Prisoner at
the Bar, carried him about half a Pint,
which he drank, and was immediately
sick, and call'd for a Bason to be brought
up to his Room; and that she, this
Witness, carry'd up a clean one: Being
ask'd if he had made Use of it, she
answered Yes, and discharg'd into it about
half a Pint; that he complain'd of
violent Pains in his Stomach and Bowels;
that next Morning he sent for Mr. (^Norton^) ,
who gave him something, and he was
easier; that in the Afternoon (^Robert
Harman^) brought Orders from his Master
to have a little Water-gruel warm'd
instantly; that she warm'd it accordingly,
and the Prisoner carried it to her Father;
that he drank that also, and was
immediately affected in the same Manner as
before, but more violently; that on
(^Wednesday^) Morning her Master took Physick,
and Miss told her, her Father would want
Water-gruel; and on this Witness's
saying she would leave her Ironing and make
some, Miss (^Blandy^) reply'd,$] (^there's no
Occasion for that, the Gruel in the Pan
will serve^) ; [$that thinking that too stale,
and having tasted it the Day before, and
imagining it tasted ill, she went and tasted
it a second Time, when, upon lifting the
Pan to her Mouth, she observ'd a white
Settling at the Bottom; and that upon
seeing it so white, she felt it between
her Finger and Thumb, and found it
gritty; that she then went into the
Kitchen to (^Betty Binfield^) , the Cook-maid,
and desired she would look at it, for the
Oatmeal was very white; that (^Betty^)
said$] Oatmeal, why 'tis as white as Flour;
<P 8C2>
yes, [$answered this Witness,$] but it feels
more gritty than any we ever had; [$that
this Witness then took it to the Door,
when it appear'd still more white;
whereupon she immediately recollected
that she had been told that Poison was
white and gritty; and it then came into
her Mind, that her Master's Disorder
was occasioned by Poison? and she
immediately took the Pan to Mrs.
(^Mountney^) , told her what she suspected, and
desired her to shew it to Mr. (^Norton^) the
Apothecary: Being ask'd who she
believed put that white Stuff into the Gruel,
she said the Prisoner: Being asked why
she suspected her, reply'd, that the
(^Monday^) before, when the Gruel was made,
Miss (^Blandy^) was some Time in the
Pantry stirring it, and then coming into
the Kitchen, she said,$] I have been
stirring the Gruel, and eating some of the
Oatmeal out of it, for I have taken a
great Fancy to it, and believe I shall
often eat it out of my Father's Gruel. --
[$That on (^Friday^) the 9th, she told Mr.
(^Stevens^) , her Master's Brother-in-law,
what she suspected, and desired him to
acquaint her Master, who said, that he
could not bear to do it; that she
continued very uneasy, and on (^Saturday^)
Morning the 10th came to a Resolution
to acquaint her Master herself, which she
accordingly did, and begg'd he would
let his Daughter see him as little as 
possible; that he accordingly forbid her
from coming into his Chamber; and then
said,$] (^Oh! that damn'd Villain^) Cranston,
(^that has eat of the best, and drank of the
best that my House afforded, to serve me
thus, and to ruin my poor love-sick Girl^) . --
[$That on (^Monday^) , at Miss's Request, her
Father consented to see her; that she,
this Witness, was present when Miss
came into her Chamber, and fell down
upon her Knees, and said,$] (^Oh! Sir,
forgive me, send me where you will, and I'll
never see or hear from, or write to^) Cranston
<P 9C1>
(^more; so you do but forgive me I shall be
happy^) . [$To which Mr. Blandy reply'd,$]
(^I do forgive thee, but thou shoulst'st have
remembred I am your Father, but for
that Villain^) Cranston, (^if thou had'st loved
me, thou would'st curse him and the Ground
he walks upon^) . [$Upon this Miss said,$] (^Oh
Sir! your Kindness to me strikes Daggers to
my Soul^) ; Sir, (^I must down on my Knees
and pray that you will not curse me^) ; [$he
reply'd,$] (^I curse thee! no Child I bless thee,
and hope God will bless thee, and I pray thou
may'st live to repent and amend. -- Leave
me least thou shouldst say something to thy
Prejudice; go to thy Uncle^) Stevens, (^he
will take Care of thee; alass poor Man,
I am sorry for him^) . [$Miss then declared
she was innocent of his Illness, when
this Witness reply'd, she was afraid she
was not quite innocent, and that some
of the Powder was in such Hands as 
would appear against her.$]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 10C1>
   [$ (^Elizabeth Binfield^) , the Cook-Maid, depos'd,
That on (^Monday^) the 5th of (^August^) last, a Pan
<P 10C2>
of Water-gruel was made for her Master, the
Deceased Mr. (^Blandy^) ; that Miss (^Blandy^) , the
Prisoner at the Bar, came into the Kitchen, and
said,$] (^Betty, I have been stirring your Water-gruel,
and eating some of the Oatmeal, and believe I shall
often eat some out of my Father's Gruel^) . [$That
that Evening her Master had some of the Gruel,
and was taken very ill after it; that the next
Day Mr. (^Norton^) the Apothecary was sent for,
and that toward the Evening her Master was
better; but the next Day he drank some
more Gruel, and was worse than before, with
vomiting and purging, and complain'd that he
had a Ball of Fire in his Guts. That the
next Day, (^Wednesday, Susan Gunnell^) brought
a Pan with some Gruel in it into the Kitchen,
and said,$] (^Betty, did you ever see any Oatmeal
so white^) ? [$that this Witness reply'd,$] 
Oatmeal! 'tis more like Flour; [$that (^Susan^) said,$]
I never saw any so gritty in my Life; [$that
then (^Susan^) took the Pan to Mrs. (^Mountney's^) .
That the (^Friday^) after, her Master and Miss
were in the Kitchen, her Master said to this
Witness,$] (^Betty^) , what Day of the Month is
this? [$which being informed of, he replied,$]
about this Time of the Year Queen (^Anne^) was
poisoned. I remember, [$continued he,$] that a
long while ago, being in Company at the 
(^Red-Lion^) , they gave us some damn'd Stuff that
poison'd us all, one died presently after,
another is dead since, and now I fear 'tis my Fate
to be poisoned at last. [$That Miss seemed
much surprized, but with a forced Smile, said,$]
(^I remember it very well, Papa, 'tis twenty Years
ago^) , [$and went away immediately.$] 

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 11C2>
   [$Mr. (^Littleton^) , Mr. (^Blandy's^) Clerk, being
next call'd and sworn, said, That he had been
out of (^Henley^) to visit his Father in
(^Warwickshire^) , and on his Return on (^Saturday^) Morning
the 10th of (^August^) last, he breakfasted with
his Master, the Deceased, and the Prisoner,
and found his Master much disordered; that
Miss poured out a Dish of Tea for her Father,
which he disliked, and said to her,$] (^There is too
much black Powder in it^) ; [$upon which she
seemed confused, and seemed to have a Tremor on
her, and went out of the Room; that the
Deceased then took the Cup with the Tea, and
poured it into the Cat's Bason, that stood in
the Window, and went away, and would eat
no more Breakfast; that then Miss came into
the Room to this Witness, and ask'd him what
her Father had said, and he told her, that her
Father had thrown the Tea into the Cat's Bason;
<P 12C1>
and that he had left the Room, seemingly
displeased, and would not eat any more
Breakfast, but that he had said nothing. The next
Day he, this Witness, went to Church, but
Miss did not; and when he came Home, Miss
asked him to take a Walk with her and her
Father in the Garden. As they went into 
the Garden, she put a Letter into his Hand,
and desired him to direct it as usual to Capt.
(^Cranston^) , and put it into the Post; but he
hearing that his Master was poisoned, and
Miss suspected, he broke the Letter open,
read it, and then carried it to his Master,
who said,$] (^Ah! my poor love-sick Girl; but what
will not a Woman do for a Man that she loves^) !

<S SAMPLE 4>
<P 12C1>
   [$ (^Richard Fisher^) was next called and sworn,
who said he was on the Coroner's Inquest, and
on hearing that Miss (^Blandy^) was gone to the
(^Angel^) , he went after her; that he spoke with
<P 12C2>
her there, and ask'd her if she would not
return home with him; she answer'd yes, but
she was afraid of being insulted by the Mob,
and begg'd he would protect her; that upon
this he got a close Post Chaise and brought her
home; that upon her coming to her Father's 
House, and talking of the Affair, she ask'd
him what could be done for her; that he
answer'd if she could produce any Thing that
would fix it upon (^Cranston^) , possibly she might
be sav'd; that upon this, in some Agony, she
answer'd,$] (^I'm afraid I have destroy'd that
which would have hanged that Villain; but here
take this Key, search my Drawers, and see if
you can find any Papers that will be of service^) ;
[$that there being a Gentlewoman there who
better knew the House than himself, he
declin'd going, and desir'd her to search; that
she did accordingly, but could find nothing of
Consequence.$]
[^QUESTION AND ANSWER OMITTED.^]
   [$Mrs. (^Lane^) being called and sworn, said, that
she went into the (^Angel^) to her Husband, who
was there, and Miss (^Blandy^) was with him;
that she heard her Husband say to the Prisoner,
when she first went in,$] (^If you are innocent, you
will be acquitted, and if you are guilty, you will
be punished according to Law^) ; [$that upon this,
Miss (^Blandy^) stamped upon the Floor, in a
seeming Agony, and said,$] (^Oh that damned
Villain^) Cranston! (^my Honour to him has been
my Ruin^) . [$Then turning about, after a short
Pause, said,$] (^But why do I blame him? I am
more to blame; it was I administered it, and
knew the Consequence^) .
[^QUESTION AND ANSWER OMITTED.^]
   [$Mr. (^Lane^) was then called and sworn, who
said he was at the (^Angel^) , with Miss (^Blandy^) ,
and talking with her concerning her Father's
Death, she asked him what he thought would
<P 13C1>
be done to her; that he made her for Answer,
(^that she would be sent to^) Oxford-Castle, (^and be
tryed at the Assizes, and if she was innocent, she
would be acquitted, and if she was guilty, she
would be punished according to Law^) ; that Miss
then stamped on the Floor, and said,$] (^Oh that
damned Villain^) Cranston! (^my Honour to him
has been my Ruin: -- But why do I blame him?
I am more to blame^) ; [$that the Town Serjeant
coming in just at that Juncture took off his
Attention to what she said more.$]
   [$Here the Council for the Crown, tho' they
had many more Witnesses to call, rested their
Proof against the Prisoner, and she was
thereupon called to make her Defence.$]
[^DEFENCE SPEECH OMITTED.^]
<P 14C1>
   [$Then she desired the following Witnesses
might be call'd in her Defence.$]
   [$ (^Ann James^) being sworn, said, That she
frequently went as a Chairwoman to work at the
deceased Mr. (^Blandy's^) ; and being there one
Day, she heard (^Elizabeth Binfield^) say,$] (^Damn
the black Bitch^) , [$meaning the Prisoner at the
Bar,$] (^I hope I shall see her walk up a Lader and
swing^) .
   [$Being asked by the King's Council when
and where it was, and who were present when
the Words were spoken, she said (^Mary Banks^)
and one (^Deane^) ; and that they were said in the
Kitchen of the late Mr. (^Blandy's^) House, in
(^Henley^) , but she could not recollect the Day;
but it was after Miss (^Blandy^) was sent to
(^Oxford^) Castle.$]
   [$Here (^Elizabeth Binfield^) was call'd again by
the King's Council, and confronted with this
Evidence, who deny'd that she had ever said
any such Words, or had any ill Will against
Miss (^Blandy^) .$]
   [$ (^Mary Banks^) was next call'd and sworn, who
said, That she heard (^Elizabeth Binfield^) , the
Cook Maid, say,$] (^I hope the black Bitch will walk
up a Ladder and swing^) .
   [$Being asked by the King's Council when,
and where the Words where spoke, she said in
Mr. (^Blandy's^) House at (^Henley^) , and on the Day
his Body was open'd.$]
   [$Here it was observed, that there was a
material Difference in the Evidence of these two
Witnesses, the swearing possitively to the
Day the Body was open'd, and the other that
the Words were said after Miss (^Blandy^) was in
(^Oxford^) Castle, which was not till after her
Father's Remains were buried.$]
   [$ (^Edward Hearne^) was next call'd and sworn,
who said, that he had lived with the Deceased
<P 14C2>
formerly, but was now Clerk of (^Henley^) Parish;
that he frequently went to Mr. (^Blandy's^) House,
perhaps four or five Times a Week; that he
always observ'd a cordial Duty from Miss
to her Father; and that he never saw any
Mark of Undutifulness or Misbehaviour
towards her Father.$]
[^CROSS-EXAMINATION OMITTED.^]
   [$The Prisoner's Council then ask'd this
Witness, if in the whole Conversation at that
Time, he did not understand the Prisoner to
mean only the Punishment of being
imprisoned there; and whether she did not at that
Time persist in her Innocence, as to the Crime
she stood charged with; when the Witness
said, that he did understand it only as the
Punishment of being confined, and that she
always insisted on her Innocence.$]
   [$ (^Thomas Cawley^) being sworn, said, That he
frequently visited at Mr. (^Blandy's^) , as Mr.
(^Blandy^) and his Daughter did his Family; and
that he always observed a dutiful and
affectionate Carriage from Miss to her Father.$]
   [$ (^Thomas Staverton^) was next sworn, who said,
That he had a House next Door to the
Deceased, that was repairing, and therefore he, as
being acquainted in Mr. (^Blandy's^) Family, used
frequently to call there, and that he always
observed Miss to shew the greatest Mark of
Duty and Affection to her Father.$]
   [$He further said, that about four Months
before the Death of Mr. (^Blandy^) , Miss was
visiting at his House, when she said, that her
Father she believed would not marry again, let
what advantagious Offers soever be made
to him, till such Time as he had settled her
in the World: And that he had observed for
some Time past, his old Friend the Deceased,
had shrunk very much; and that he had often
thought and said, that he did not think his old
Friend Mr. (^Blandy^) would live long.$]
<P 15C1>
   [$Mrs. (^Davis^) , Landlady of the Angel, was
then call'd and sworn, who said, that she
seeing Miss (^Blandy^) going over the Bridge, with
a Mob after her, asked her where she was
going, when she made her for Answer, that
her Father was going to be opened, and that
she could not stand the Shock, so was taking
a Walk in the Air; that this Witness then
asked her to go into her House to shelter
herself from the Insults of the Mob, which Miss
accordingly did.$]
   [$She was then ask'd particularly, if she
thought she was endeavouring to get off, and
she said no, she did not, nor was it apparent to
her in any wise to think so.$]
   [$ (^Robert Stoke^) was then call'd and sworn, who
said, he being the Town Serjeant, was order'd
to go over the Bridge to the (^Angel^) , to stop
Miss (^Blandy^) , the Prisoner; that when he spoke
to her, she seemed very willing to return, and
was glad of any Protection to keep her from
the Insolence of the Mob.$]
