[}HOW SKELTEN CAME LATE HOME TO
OXFORD, FROM ABINGTON. TALE .I.}]

   [$Skelto~ was an
Englyshe man borne
as Skogyn was,
and hee was 
educated & broughte
vp in Oxfoorde:
And there was he made a Poete
Lauriat. And on a tyme hee had
ben at Abbington to make mery,
wher that he had eate salte 
meates and hee did com late home to
Oxforde, and he did lye in an Ine
named y=e= Tabere whyche is now
the Angell, and hee dyd drynke &
went to bed. About midnight he
was so thyrstie or drye that hee
<P A2V>
was constrained to call to the 
tapster for drynke, & the tapster harde
him not, Then hee cryed to hys
oste & hys ostes, and to the ostler
for drinke and no man wold here
hym,$] alacke [$sayd Skelton$] I shall
peryshe for lacke of drynke, what 
reamedye. [$At the last he dyd crie
out and sayd$] Fyer, Fyer, Fyer.
   [$Then Skelton hard euery man
bustled hym selfe vpward, & some
of them were naked, & some were
halfe a sleepe and amased, and
Skelton dyd crye$] Fier Fier [$ (styll)
that euerye man knewe not
whether to resorte. Skelton did go to
bed, and the oste and ostis & the
tapster with the ostler, dyd runne
to Skeltons chamber with
candles lyghted in theyr handes 
saying$] where? where, where, is the
fyer, here here here, [$said Skelton
<P A3R>
& poynted hys fynger to hys 
mouth, saying$] fetch me some drynke
to quenche the fyer and the heate
and the drinesse in my mouthe, [$&
so they dyd: wherfore, it is good
for euerye man to helpe hys owne
selfe in time of neede wythe some 
policie or crafte, so bee it there bee
no deceit nor falshed vsed.$]

[}HOW SKELTON DREST THE KENDALL
MAN, IN THE SWEAT TIME.}]

   [$On a time Skelto~ rode
from Oxforde to
London with a Kendalma~
and at Uxbridge they
beyted: the Kendall
man layd hys cap vpon the borde
in the hall, and he went to serue
hys horse: Skelton tooke y=e= 
Kendalmans cappe, and dyd put
<P A3V>
betwixte the linyng & the vtter syde
a dishe of butter: and when the
Kendalman had drest hys horse,
hee dyd come into diner, and dyd
put on hys cappe, (that tyme the
sweating sycknes was in all
Englande) at the last, when the
butter had take heate of the 
kendallmans heade, it dyd begynne to
run ouer hys face and aboute hys
cheekes. Skelton sayde:$] syr, you
sweate soore: beware y=t= you haue
not the sweatynge sycknesse: [$the
Kendalman sayde:$] by the Mysse
Ise wrang, I bus goe tyll bed
[$Skelton sayd:$] I am skild on
phisicke, & specially in the sweatynge
sycknesse, that I wyll warant
any man. In gewd faith [$saith the
Kendallman:$] do see, and Ise bay
for your skott to London. [$Then
sayde Skelto~:$] get you a kerchiefe
<P A4R>
and I wyll bryng you a bed, [$the
which was doone, Skelton 
caused the capp to bee sod in hoat lee, 
& dryed it: in the mornyng 
Skelton and the Kendalman dyd ride
merely to London.$]

[}HOWE SKELTON TOLDE THE MAN THAT
CHRYST WAS VERY BUSYE IN THE WOODES
WITH THEM THAT MADE FAGOTS. TALE .III.}]

   [$When Skelton
did cum to 
Lo~don ther were
manye men at
the table at
diner. Amongest
all other there was one sayde to
Skelten:$] Be you of Oxforde, or
of Cambridge a scoler? [$Skelton
sayd:$] I am of Oxford. Syr [$sayde
the man,$] I will put you a questio~
<P A4V>
you do know wel that after christ
dyd rise from death to life, it was
xl. days after ere he dyd ascend in
to heauen, and hee was but
certaine times wyth hys Discyples,
and when that he did appeare to
them, hee dyd neuer tary longe 
amongest them, but sodainely 
vanished from them, I wold fayne
know [$ (saith the man to Skelton) $]
where Chryste was all these .xl.
dayes. Where hee was, [$saythe
Skelton,$] God knoweth, hee was
verye busye in the woods among
hys labourers that dyd make
fagottes to burne heretickes, & such
as thou art the whych doest aske
such diffuse questions: but nowe
I wyll tell thee more: when hee
was not with hys mother & hys
Disciples, hee was in Paradyce,
to comforte the holye Patriarkes
<P A5R>
and Prophets soules, the which
before he had fet out of Hell. And
at the daye of hys Ascencion, hee
tooke them all vp wyth him into
heauen.

where there did come
to hym a Welshman,
saying:$] Syr, it is so, that manye

   [$When Maister
Skelton dyd

was a greede
with a Miller
to haue hys corne grounde, tolle
free and manye tymes when hys
mayden shoulde bake, they
wanted of their mele, and complained
to their Mystres that they could
not make their stint of breade.
Mystres Skelton beeynge verye
angrye, tolde her husbande of it:
Then Master Skelton sent for
his Miller and asked hym howe
it chansed thet hee deceyued hym

apoynted one of hys seruantes to
stand at the mill whyle the corne

beyng a notable theefe, would fayn
haue deceued [^"u" in "deceued" UNCLEAR IN SOURCE TEXT^] him as he   #

thought not of the meale, and the
while the myllers boye was redy
wyth a sacke and stole awaye the
corne, so when they had taken vp
the childe and all was safe, they
came in agayne: & so the seruaunt
hauynge hys gryste, went home
<P C2V>
mistrustyng nothynge, and when
the maydes came to bake againe,
as they dyd before so they lacked
of theyr meale agayne. Master
Skelton calde for hys man and
asked him howe it chaunced that
he was deceaued, & hee sayd that
hee coulde not tell,$] for I dyd your
commaundement. [$And then
Master Skelton sent for the Myller,
and sayde,$] thou hast not vsed mee
wel: for I want of my mele. why
what wold you haue me do [$sayde
the miller,$] you haue set your own
man to watche mee. Well then
[$sayd Skelto~,$] if thou doest not tell 
me whych waye thou hast played
the theefe wyth mee, thou shalt
be hanged. I praye you be good
master vnto me, & I wyll tell you
the trutthe: your seruaunt wold
not from my myll, & when I sawe
<P C3R>
none other remedye I caused my
wyfe to put one of my chyldren in
to the water, & to crie that it was
drowned: and whiles wee were
helpyng of the chylde out, one of
my boyes dyd steale your corne.
Yea, [$sayde Skelton:$] if thou haue
suche pretie fetchis, you can dooe
more then thys. And therfore, if
thou dooeste not one thynge that
I shall tell thee. I wyll folow the
lawe on thee. What is that, [$sayd
the Myller:$] If that thou dooest
not steale my cuppe of the table,
when I am sette at meate, thou
shalt not eskape my handes. O
good Master, [$sayd Iohn Miller,$]
I pray you forgeue me, and let me
not dooe thys, I am not able to
dooe it. Thou shalt neuer be

thou dooest it. [$When the Miller
<P C3V>

for doyng any harme.
   And it chaunced, that one of
Skeltons seruauntes came oute,
and spied the fire, and hee cryede:$]
helpe, helpe: for all that my 
master hath, is lyke to be burnt. [$Hys
master heari~g this, rose from hys
supper with all the co~panie, and 
went to quenche the fyre. And
the while Iohn Miller came in:
and stole away hys cuppe, & went
hys way. The fire being quickly
slaked, Skelton cam in with his
frendes, and reasoned wyth hys
frendes which way they thought
the fyre shoulde come, and euerye
ma~ made answer as thei thought
<P C4R>
good. And as they wer resonyng
Skelton called for a cup of beare,
and in no wise his cuppe whyche
hee vsed to drynke in, woulde
not be founde, Skelton [^SOURCE TEXT: Skeleon^] was
verye angrie that his cup was
mysynge, and asked whiche waye it
shoulde bee gone. And no manne
coulde tell hym of it. At last he 
bethought him of the Miller, & sayd$]
surely, he, that theefe hath done
this deede, and he is worthye to
be hanged. [$And hee sent for the
Miller: so the Miller tolde hym
all howe hee had done.$] Truely
[$sayd Skelton,$] thou art a notable
knaue. And withoute thou canste
do me one other feate, thou shalte
dye. O good Master, [$sayde the
Miller,$] you promised to pardon
me, and wil you now breake your
promise? I [$sayd Skelton,$]
<P C4V>
wythout thou canste steale the sheetes
of my bed, when my wyfe and I
am a slepe, thou shalte be hanged
that all suche knaues shall take
ensample by thee. Alas, [$sayd the
Miller,$] whych waye shall I dooe
this thinge, it is vnpossible for me
to get theym while you bee there.
Well, [$sayde Skelton,$] with oute
thou dooe it, thou knowest the
daunger. [$The Myller went hys
way, beyng very heauy, & studyed
whiche waye he myght doo thys
deede, He hauynge a little boye.
Whyche knewe all the corners of
Skeltons house, & where hee lay.
Vpon a night whe~ they were all
busie, the boie crepte in vnder his
bed, wyth a potte of yeste, and
when Skelton & hys wyfe were
fast a slepe, hee all to noynted the
sheetes with yeste, as farre as hee 
<P C5R>
coulde reache. At last Skelton
awaked & felt the sheetes all wete,
waked his wife and sayd:$] what,
hast thou be shitten the bed? [$and
she sayd$] naye, it is you that haue
doone it, I thynke, for I am sure
it is not I. [$And so theare fel a 
great strife betweene Skelto~ and
his wyfe thinkyng that the bedd
had ben be shitten, and called for
the mayde to geue them a cleane
payre of shetes. And so they arose
& the mayde tooke the foule 
sheetes and threw them vnderneath
the bed, thinkynge the nexte
morning to haue fetched them away.
The next time the maydes shuld
goe to washynge, they looked all
about and coulde not fynde the
sheetes, for Iacke the myllers boy
had stollen them away: then the
Myller was sent for agayne, to
<P C5V>
knowe where the sheetes were
be come: & the Myller tolde
mayster Skelton all, how he deuised
to steale the sheetes.$] Howe say ye,
[$sayde Skelton to hys frendes:$] is
not this a notable theef, is he not
worthy to be hanged, that canne
dooe these deedes. O good
Maister, [$quoth the Miller,$] nowe 
forgeue mee accordynge to youre,
promyse, for I haue done all that
you haue commaunded mee, and
I trust now you wyll pardon me.
Naye, [$quoth Skelton$] thou shalt
doo yet one other feate, and that
shall bee thys: Thou shalte steale
maister Person out of hys bed, at
midnight, that he shall not know
where he is be come, [$The Miller
made great mone, and lamented
saying:$] I can not tel in the world
howe I shall doo, for I am neuer
<P C6R>
able to dooe this feate: well, [$sayde
Skelton,$] thou shalt dooe it or els
thou shalt fynde no fauour at my
hands. and therfore go thy way,

[^TWO OR THREE NIGHTS LATER, THE MILLER SNEAKED INTO CHURCH 
WITH SOME SNAILS WHICH, AFTER HE HAD SECURED CANDLES TO 
THEIR BACKS, WERE LEFT TO CREEP ABOUT. HE THEN DRESSED 
HIMSELF IN PRIESTLY VESTMENTS AND RANG A BELL. THE BELL 
CAUSED THE PRIEST TO COME TO HIS WINDOW. SEEING THE LITTLE 
FLAMES, AND BELIEVING THE CHURCH TO BE ON FIRE, THE PRIEST 
CAME TO INVESTIGATE, WHEREUPON HE FOUND AN ANGELIC FIGURE 
AT PRAYER.^]

<P C6V>
[^---^] In the  
<P C7R>        
name of the father the sonne and
the holy ghoste: What arte thou
that standest here in thys hollye
place, O [$sayde the Myller:$] I
am saynt Peter, whych kepte the
Keyes of heauen gate, and thou
knowest that none can enter into
heauen excepte I let hym in, and
I am sent oute from heauen for
thee. For mee, [$quoth the Preest:$]
Good saynt Peter, worship maye
thou be,) I am glad to heare that
newes,) Because thou hast done
good deedes [$sayd the myller,$] and
serued God, hee hath sent for thee
afore domes day come, that thou
shalt not knowe the troubles of y=e=
worlde. O, blessed be God, [$sayde
the Preest:$] I am very well
contented for to goe: yet if it woulde
please God to let me go home and
distrybute such things as I haue
<P C7V>
to the poore, I woulde bee verye
glad? No [$sayde the Miller$] if thou
dooest delite more in thy goodes,
then in the Ioyes of heaue~, thou
art not for God, therefore prepare
thy selfe, and goe into this bagge
which I haue brought for thee.
[$The miller hauyng a great
quarter sacke, the poore Priest wente
into it, thynkyng verylye hee had
gon to heauen, yet was very sory
to parte from hys goodes: Asked
saynt Peter how long it wold be
ere he came there: the miller sayd
he should be there quickly, and in
he got the Priest and tied vp the
sacke, and put out the lightes, &
layed euery thynge in their place,
and tooke the preest on his backe
& locked the church dores & to go,
and when he came to go ouer the
church stile, the Preest was verye
<P C8R>
heauye, and the Miller caste hym
ouer the stile that the priest cryed$]
oh. O good seint Peter [$sayde the
Preeste,$] whyther goe I nowe, O
[$sayde the Myller:$] These bee the
panges that ye must abyde before
you come to heauen. O [$quoth
the Preest,$] I would I were there
once. [$Vp he got the Priest agayn
& caried hym tyll hee came to the
toppe of an hye hyll, a litle from
hys house, and caste hym downe
the hyll that hys head had many
shrewde rappes, that hys necke
was almost burst:$] O good saynt
Peter [$said the Priest:$] where am
I nowe: you are almost nowe at
heauen, [$& caried hym with much
a doo, tyll hee came to hys owne 
house, and then the miller threwe
him ouer the thresholde.$] O good
saynte Peter, [$sayde the Preeste:$]
<P C8V>
Where am I nowe, thys is the
soreste pange that euer I byede.
O [$sayd that Myller:$] geue GOD
thankes that thou haste had
pacience to a bide all thys payne, for
nowe thou arte goyng vppe into
heauen, [$and tyed a rope a boute
the sacke, and drewe hym vppe to
the toppe of the Chymnye, and
there let him hange.$] O good S.
Peter, tell me nowe where I am
[$sayde the Preest.$] Marye [$sayd he,$]
thou art now in the tope of Iohn
Millers chimney. A vengeaunce
on thee knaue: [$sayde the Preeste:$]
hast thou made me beleue al this
while that I was goyng vp into
heauen? Well, nowe I am here, &
euer I come downe again. I wil
make thee to repe~t it: [$But Iohn
Myller was gladd that hee had
brought hym there. And in the
<P D1R>
mornyng, the Sexten rang all in
to seruise, & when the people were
come to Churche, the Preest was
lackynge, the parish asked the 
sexten wher the Preest was, and the
sexten sayd,$] I can not tell. [$Then
the parrishe sent to master 
Skelton, and tolde howe their Prieste
was lacking to saye them seruice.
Mayster Skelton meruayled at
that, and bethought hym of the
crafty dooyng of the Miller, sent
for Iohn Myller: and when the
Miller was come. Skelton sayd:
to the miller:$] canst thou tell wher
the parish Preest is? [$The Myller
vp and told him all togither how
he had doone. Maister Skelton
considering the matter, sayde to
the Miller:$] why thou vnreuere~t
knaue, hast thou hanled the poore
Preest on this fashion, and putte
<P D1V>
on the holy orname~ts vpon a 
knaues backe: thou shalte be hanged
& it coste me all the good I haue.
[$Iohn miller fell vppon his knees
and desyred Maister Skelton to
pardon hym,$] for I dyd nothynge
[$sayd the miller,$] but that you sayd
you woulde forgeue me. Nay not
so, [$sayd Skelto~.$] But if thou canst
steale my gelding out of my stable
my two me~ watching him, I will
pardon thee, and if they take thee
they shall strike of thy heade: for
Skelton thoughte it better that
such a false knaue shoulde lose hys
head, the~ to liue. [^...^]

[^THE MILLER REMOVED THE HEAD OF A CORPSE LEFT HANGING 
FROM THE GALLOWS AND TIED IT TO A POLL. WHEN HE STUCK
THIS INTO THE STABLE, MASTER SKELTON'S MEN CUT OFF THE HEAD 
AND TOOK IT TO THEIR MASTER, WHICH GAVE THE MILLER THE TIME
HE NEEDED TO STEAL THE GELDING.^]

<P D2R>
[$Master Skelton lookyng vppon
the head, sawe it was the theues
head that was left hangyng vpo~
the galowes, sayd:$] alas how ofte
hath this false knaue deceiued vs
Go quickly to the stable agayne,
for I thinke my geldyng is gone.

[}HOWE THE VINTENERS WIFE PUT WATER
INTO SKELTONS WINE. TALE .XV.}]

   [$Skelton did loue wel a cup
of good wyne. And on a 
daye, he dyd make merye
in a Tauerne to Londo~: and the
morow after hee sent to the same
place againe for a quart of y=e= same
wine he drunke of before, the
whiche was clene chaunged & brued
again. Skelto~ perceiuing this, he
went to the Tauerne & dyd sytte
down in a chaire & dyd sygh very
sore and made great lame~tacion,
The wife of the house perceiuinge
this, said to master Skelto~:$] howe
is it with you master Skelto~: [$he
<P D4R>
answered and said:$] I dyd neuer so euill,
[$and then hee dyd reache an other greate
syghe, sayinge:$] I am afraide that I shall
neuer be saued, nor cum to heauen, why
[$said the wife$] shuld you dispaire so much
in Goddes mercy? Nay [$said he,$] it is past
all remedye. [$Then said the wife:$] I dooe
praye you breake your mind vnto mee.
O [$sayd Skelton$] I would gladlye shewe
you the cause of my dolour if that I wist
that you would keepe my counsell. Sir
[$said shee,$] I haue ben made of councel of
greater matters then you can shew me.
Naye nay [$said Skelton,$] my matter
passeth all other matters, for I think I shal
sinke to hell for my great offences: for I
sent thys daye to you for Wyne to saye
masse with all; and wee haue a stronge
lawe that euery priest is bounde to put
into hys Chalice when hee doth singe or
saye masse, some wyne and water: the
which dothe signifye the water & bloude
that dyd runne oute of Chrystes syde
when Longeons the blynde knyght dyd
thrust a speare to Christes harte: & thys
<P D4V>
daye I dyd put no water into my wyne,
when that I did put wine into my
Chalys. [$Then sayd the Vintiners wife:$] Be
mery maister Skelton, and keepe my
counsell, for by my faythe I dyd put into
the vessell of wyne that I did send you of
to day .x. gallandes of water. And
therfore take no thought master Skelto~ for
I warraunt you. [$Then said Skelton:$]
Dame I dooe be shrewe thee for thy
laboure, for I thought so muche before: for
throughe such vses & brewyng of wyne,
maye men be deceyued, and be hurte by
drynkinge of suche euell wyne: for all
wines must be strong and fayre and
well coloured: It must haue a
redolent sauoure: It must be
colde and sprinkclynge
in the peece or in 
the glasse.
