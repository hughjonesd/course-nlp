[$Scene (^the Play-House^) .$]

[$ (^Enter several Players.^) $]

   [$1 (^Player.^) $]
Mr. (^Emphasis^) , good-morrow, you are early 
at the Rehearsal this Morning.
   [$ (^Emph.^) $] Why, faith, (^Jack^) , our Beer and
Beer sat but ill on my Stomach, so I got
up to try if I could not walk it off.
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] I wish I had any thing in my Stomach to
walk off; if Matters do not go better with us shortly,
my Teeth will forget their Office.
   [$2 (^Play.^) $] These are poor Times, indeed, not like the
Days of (^Pasquin^) .
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Oh! name 'em not! those were glorious
Days indeed, the Days of Beef and Punch; my Friends,
when come there such again?
   [$2 (^Play.^) $] -- Who knows what this new Author,
may produce? Faith I like my Part very well.
<P 2>
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Nay, if Variety will please the Town, I
am sure there is enough of it, but I could wish, 
methinks, the Satire had been a little stronger, a little
plainer.
   [$2 (^Play.^) $] Now I think it is plain enough.
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Hum! Ay, it is intelligible; but I wou'd
have it downright; 'gad, I fancy I cou'd write a
thing to succeed, my self.
   [$2 (^Play.^) $] Ay, prithee, what Subject wou'dst thou
write on?
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Why, no Subject at all, Sir, but I would
have a humming deal of Satyr, and I would repeat
in every Page, that Courtiers are Cheats and don't
pay their Debts, that Lawyers are Rogues, Physicians
Blockheads, Soldiers Cowards, and Ministers --
   [$2 (^Play.^) $] What, what, Sir?
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Nay, I'll only name 'em, that's enough to
set the Audience a hooting.
   [$2 (^Play.^) $] Zounds, Sir, here is Wit enough for a
whole Play in one Speech.
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] For one Play, why, Sir, it's all I have 
extracted out of above a Dozen.
   [$2 (^Play.^) $] Who have we here?
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Some Gentlemen, I suppose, come to hear
the Rehearsal.

[$ (^Enter^) Sowrwit (^and Lord^) Dapper.$]

   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Pray, Gentlemen, don't you rehearse the
(^Historical Register^) this Morning?
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Sir, we expect the Author every Minute.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] What is this (^Historical Register^) , is it a
Tragedy, or a Comedy?
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Upon my Word, Sir, I can't tell.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Then I suppose you have no Part in it.
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Yes, Sir, I have several, but -- Oh, here
is the Author himself, I suppose he can tell, Sir.
   [$(^Sowr.^) $] Faith, Sir, that's more than I suppose.
<P 3>
[$ (^Enter^) Medley.$]

   [$ (^Med.^) $] My Lord, your most obedient Servant; this
is a very great, and unexpected Favour indeed, my
Lord. Mr. (^Sowrwit^) , I kiss your Hands; I am very
glad to see you here.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] That's more than you may be by-and-by,
perhaps.
   [$ (^Dap.^) $] We are come to attend your Rehearsal, Sir;
Pray when will it begin?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] This very Instant, my Lord: Gentlemen, I
beg you would be all ready, and let the Prompter
bring me some Copies for these Gentlemen.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Mr. (^Medley^) , you know I am a plain Speaker,
so you will excuse any Liberties I take.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Dear Sir, you can't oblige me more.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Then I must tell you, Sir, I am a little 
stagger'd at the Name of your Piece; doubtless, Sir,
you know the Rules of Writing, and I can't guess
how you can bring the Actions of a whole Year into
the Circumference of four and twenty Hours.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, I have several Answers to make to your
Objection; in the first Place, my Piece is not of a 
Nature confin'd to any Rules, as being avowedly
irregular, but if it was otherwise I think I could quote
you Precedents of Plays that neglect them; besides,
Sir, if I comprise the whole Actions of the Year in
half an Hour, will you blame me, or those who
have done so little in that time? My Register is not
to be fill'd like those of vulgar News-Writers with
Trash for want of News, and therefore if I say little
or nothing, you may thank those who have done
little or nothing.

[$ (^Enter^) Prompter (^with Books^) .$]

Oh! here are my Books.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] In Print already, Mr. (^Medley^) ?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Yes, Sir, it is the safest way, for if a Man
<P 4>
stays till he is damn'd, it is possible he never may
get into print at all; the Town is capricious, for
which Reason always print as fast as you write, that
if they damn your Play, they may not damn your
Copy too.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Well, Sir, and pray what is your Design, 
your Plot?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Why, Sir, I have several Plots, some pretty
deep, and some but shallow.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] I hope, Sir, they all conduce to the main
Design.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Yes, Sir, they do.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Pray, Sir, what is that?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] To divert the Town, and bring full Houses.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Pshaw! you misunderstand me, I mean
what is your Moral, your, your, your -- 
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Oh! Sir, I comprehend you -- Why, Sir,
my Design is to ridicule the vicious and foolish
Customs of the Age, and that in a fair manner,
without Fear, Favour, or Ill-nature, and without
Scurrility, ill Manners, or common Place; I hope to
expose the reigning Follies in such a manner, that Men
shall laugh themselves out of them before they feel
that they are touch'd.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] But what Thread or Connexion can you
have in this History? For instance, how is your
Political connected with you Theatrical?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] O very easily -- When my Politicks come to
a Farce, they very naturally lead me to the
Play-House, where, let me tell you, there are some
Politicians too, where there is Lying, Flattering,
Dissembling, Promising, Deceiving, and Undermining,
as well as in any Court in Christendom.

[$ (^Enter a Player.^) $]

   [$ (^Play.^) $] Won't you begin your Rehearsal, Sir?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Ay, ay, with all my Heart, is the Musick
ready for the Prologue?
<P 5>
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Musick for the Prologue!
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Ay, Sir,  I intend to have every thing new, I
had rather be the Author of my own Dulness than
the Publisher of other Mens Wit, and really, Mr.
(^Sowrwit^) , the Subjects for Prologues are utterly
exhausted: I think the general Method has been either
to frighten the Audience with the Author's
Reputation, or to flatter them to give their Applause,
or to beseech them to it, and that in a manner that
will serve for every Play alike: Now, Sir, my
Prologue will serve for no Play but my own, and to that
I think nothing can be better adapted, for as mine is
the History of the Year, what can be a properer
Prologue than an Ode to the New Year?
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] An Ode to the New Year?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Yes, Sir, an Ode to the New Year -- Come,
begin, begin.

[$ (^Enter^) Prompter.$]

   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Sir, the Prologue is ready.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Dear (^Medley^) , let me hear you read it,
possibly it may be sung so fine I may not understand a
Word of it.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, you can't oblige me more.

[^TWELVE LINES OF "ODE TO THE NEW YEAR" OMITTED.^]
<P 6>
[^EIGHT REMAINING LINES OF ODE OMITTED.^]
Ay, ay, come on, and sing it away.

[$ (^Enter Singers, who sing the Ode.^) $]

   [$ (^Med.^) $] There, Sir, there's the very Quintessence and
Cream of all the Odes I have seen for several Years
last past.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Ay, Sir, I thought you wou'd not be the
Publisher of another Man's Wit?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] No more I an't, Sir, for the Devil of any
Wit did I ever see in any of them.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Oh! your most humble Servant, Sir.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Yours, Sir, yours; now for my Play,
(^Prompter^) , are the Politicians all ready at the Table?
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] I'll go and see, Sir. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Med.^) $] My first Scene, Mr. (^Sowrwit^) , lies in the Island
of (^Corsica^) , being at present the chief Scene of
Politicks of all (^Europe^) .

[$ (^Enter^) Prompter.$]

   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Sir, they are ready.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Then draw the Scene, and discover them.

[$SCENE (^draws, and discovers Five Politicians
sitting at a Table^) .$]

   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Here's a Mistake in the Print, Mr. (^Medley^) ,
I observe the second Politician is the first Person who 
speaks.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, my first and greatest Politician never
speaks at all, he's a very deep Man, by which, you
<P 7>
will observe I convey this Moral, that the chief Art
of a Politician is to keep a Secret.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] To keep his Politicks a Secret, I suppose
you mean.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Come, Sir, begin.
   [$2 (^Polit.^) $] Is King (^Theodore^) return'd yet?
   [$3 (^Polit.^) $] No.
   [$2 (^Polit.^) $] When will he return?
   [$3 (^Polit.^) $] I cannot tell.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] This Politician seems to me to know very 
little of the matter.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Zounds, Sir, would you have him a Prophet as
well as a Politician? You see, Sir, he knows what's
past, and that's all he ought to know; 'Sblood, Sir,
would it be in the Character of a Politician to make
him a Conjurer? Go on, Gentlemen: Pray, Sir, don't
interrupt their Debates, for they are of great
Consequence.
   [$2 (^Polit.^) $] These mighty Preparations of the (^Turks^)
are certainly design'd against some Place or other;
now, the Question is, What Place they are design'd
against? And that is a Question which I cannot
answer.
   [$3 (^Polit.^) $] But it behoves us to be upon our Guard.
   [$4 (^Polit.^) $] It does, and the Reason is, because we
know nothing of the matter.
   [$2 (^Polit.^) $] You say right, it is easy for a Man to
guard against Dangers which he knows of, but to
guard against Dangers which no Body knows of,
requires a very great (^Politician^) .
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Now, Sir, I suppose you think that no Body
knows any thing.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Faith, Sir, it appears so.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Ay, Sir, but there is one who knows, that
little Gentleman, yonder in the Chair, who says
nothing, knows it all.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] But how do you intend to convey this 
Knowledge to the Audience?
<P 8>
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, they can read it in his Looks; 'Sblood,
Sir, must not a Politician be thought a wise Man
without his giving Instances of his Wisdom?
   [$5 (^Polit.^) $] Hang foreign Affairs, let us apply
ourselves to Money.
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] Ay, ay, ay.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Gentlemen, that over again -- and be sure to
snatch hastily at the Money; you're pretty Politicians
truly.
   [$5 (^Polit.^) $] Hang foreign Affairs, let us apply
ourselves to Money.
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] Ay, ay, ay.
   [$2 (^Polit.^) $] All we have to consider relating to Money
is how we shall get it.
   [$3 (^Polit.^) $] I think we ought first to consider whether
there is any to be got, which if there be, I do
readily agree that the next Question is how to come at it.
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] Hum.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Pray, Sir, what are these Gentlemen in 
(^Corsica^) ?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Why, Sir, they are the ablest Heads in the
Kingdom, and consequently the greatest Men, for
you may be sure all well-regulated Governments, as
I represent this of (^Corsica^) to be, will employ in their
greatest Posts Men of the greatest Capacity.
   [$2 (^Polit.^) $] I have consider'd the Matter, and I find it
must be by a Tax.
   [$3 (^Polit.^) $] I thought of that, and was considering
what was not tax'd already.
   [$2 (^Polit.^) $] Learning; suppose we put a Tax upon
Learning.
   [$3 (^Polit.^) $] Learning, it is true, is a useless Commodity,
but I think we had better lay it on Ignorance, for
Learning being the Property but of a very few, and
those poor ones too, I am afraid we can get little 
among them; whereas Ignorance will take in most
of the great Fortunes in the Kingdom.
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] Ay, ay, ay. [$ (^Exeunt^) Politicians.$]
<P 9>
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Faith, it's very generous in these 
Gentlemen to tax themselves so readily.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Ay and very wise too to prevent the People's
grumbling, and they will have it all among
themselves.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] But what is become of the Politicians?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] They are gone, Sir, they're gone; they
have finish'd the Business they met about, which was
to agree on a Tax, that being done -- they are
gone to raise it; and this, Sir, is the full Account of
the whole History of (^Europe^) , as far as we know of
it, compriz'd in one Scene.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] The Devil it is! Why, you have not
mention'd one Word of (^France^) , or (^Spain^) , or the
Emperor.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] No, Sir, I turn those over to the next Year,
by which time we may possibly know something
what they are about; at present our Advices are so
very uncertain, I know not what to depend on; but
come, Sir, now you shall have a Council of Ladies.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Does this Scene lie in (^Corsica^) too?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] No, no, this lies in (^London^) -- You know,
Sir, it would not have been quite so proper to have
brought (^English^) Politicians (of the male Kind I mean)
on the Stage, because our Politicks are not quite so
famous; but in Female Politicians, to the Honour of
my Countrywomen I say it, I believe no Country
can excel us; come, draw the Scene, and discover
the Ladies.
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Sir, they are not here; one of them is
practising above Stairs with a Dancing-master, and I can't
get her down.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] I'll fetch 'em, I warrant you. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Well, my Lord, what does your
Lordship think of what you have seen?
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Faith, Sir, I did not observe it; but it's
damn'd Stuff, I am sure.
<P 10>
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] I think so, and I hope your Lordship will not
encourage it. They are such Men as your Lordship,
who must reform the Age; if Persons of your exquisite
and refin'd Taste will give a Sanction to politer
Entertainments, the Town will soon be asham'd of
laughing at what they do now.
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Really, this is a very bad House.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] It is not indeed so large as the others, but
I think one hears better in it.
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Pox of of hearing, one can't see -- one's
self I mean; here are no Looking-glasses, I love
(^Lincoln's-Inn-Fields^) for that Reason better than any
House in Town.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Very true, my Lord, but I wish your
Lordship would think it worth your Consideration, as the
Morals of a People depend, as has been so often
and well prov'd, entirely on their publick Diversions,
it would be of great Consequence that those of the
sublimest Kind should meet with your Lordship's and
the rest of the Nobility's Countenance.
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Mr. (^Sowrwit^) , I am always ready to give
my Countenance to any thing of that kind, which
might bring the best Company together, for as one
does not go to see the Play but the Company, I think
that's chiefly to be consider'd, and therefore I am
always ready to countenance good Plays.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] No one is a better Judge what is so than
your Lordship.
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Not I, indeed, Mr. (^Sowrwit^) -- but as I
am one half of the Play in the (^Green-Room^) talking
to the Actresses, and the other half in the Boxes
talking to the Women of Quality, I have an
Opportunity of seeing something of the Play, and perhaps may
be as good a Judge as another.

[$ (^Enter^) Medley.$]

   [$ (^Med.^) $] My Lord, the Ladies cannot begin yet, if
your Lordship will honour me in the (^Green-Room^) ,
<P 11>
where you will find it pleasanter than upon this cold
Stage.
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] With all my Heart -- Come, Mr. 
(^Sowrwit^) .
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] I attend your Lordship. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Thou art a sweet Judge of Plays, indeed, 
and yet it is in the Power of such Sparks as these to
damn an honest Fellow, both in his Profit and
Reputation. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

[}ACT II. SCENE I.}]

[$ (^Enter^) Medley, (^Lord^) Dapper, Sowrwit (^and^) Prompter.$]

   [$ (^Med.^) $] Come, draw the Scene, and discover the 
Ladies in Council; pray, my Lord, sit.
[$ (^The Scene draws and discovers four Ladies.^) $]
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] What are these Ladies assembled about?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Affairs of great Importance, as you will
see -- Please to begin all of you.
[$ (^The Ladies all speak together.^) $]
   [$ (^All Ladies.^) $] Was you at the Opera, Madam, last
Night?
   [$2 (^Lady.^) $] Who can miss an Opera when (^Farinello^)
stays?
   [$3 (^Lady.^) $] Sure he is the charmingest Creature.
   [$4 (^Lady.^) $] He's every thing in the World one could
wish.
   [$1 (^Lady.^) $] Almost every thing one could wish.
   [$2 (^Lady.^) $] They say there's a Lady in the City has a
Child by him.
   [$ (^All Ladies^) $] Ha, ha, ha!
   [$1 (^Lady.^) $] Well it must be charming to have a Child
by him.
<P 12>
   [$3 (^Lady.^) $] Madam, I met a Lady in a Visit the other
Day with three.
   [$ (^All Ladies.^) $] All (^Farinello's^) .
   [$3 (^Lady.^) $] All (^Farinello's^) , all in Wax.
   [$1 (^Lady.^) $] Oh Gemini! Who makes them, I'll send
and bespeak half a dozen to-morrow Morning.
   [$2 (^Lady.^) $] I'll have as many as I can cram into a 
Coach with me.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Mr. (^Medley^) , Sir, is this History? this must
be Invention.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Upon my Word, Sir, it's Fact, and I take
it to be the most extraordinary Accident that has
happen'd in the whole Year, and as well worth
recording. Faith, Sir, let me tell you, I take it to be
ominous, for if we go on to improve in Luxury,
Effeminacy and Debauchery, as we have done lately, the
next Age, for ought I know, may be more like the
Children of squeaking (^Italians^) than hardy (^Britons^) .
   [$ (^All Ladies.^) $] Don't interrupt us, dear Sir.
   [$1 (^Lady.^) $] What mighty pretty Company they must
be.
   [$2 (^Lady.^) $] Oh, the prettiest Company in the World.
   [$3 (^Lady.^) $] If one could but teach them to sing like
their Father.
   [$4 (^Lady.^) $] I am afraid my Husband won't let me keep
them, for he hates I shou'd be fond of any thing but
himself.
   [$ (^All Ladies.^) $] O the unreasonable Creature!
   [$1 (^Lady.^) $] If my Husband was to make any
Objection to my having 'em, I'd run away from him, and
take the dear Babies with me.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Come, enter Beau (^Dangle^) .

[$ (^Enter^) Dangle.$]

   [$ (^Dang.^) $] Fy upon it, Ladies, what are you doing
here? Why are not you at the Auction, Mr. (^Hen^)
has been in the Pulpit this half Hour?
   [$1 (^Lady.^) $] Oh, dear Mr. (^Hen^) , I ask his Pardon, I
never miss him.
<P 13>
   [$2 (^Lady.^) $] What's to be sold to-day?
   [$1 (^Lady.^) $] Oh, I never mind that; there will be all
the World there.
   [$ (^Dang.^) $] You'll find it almost impossible to get in.
   [$ (^All Ladies.^) $] Oh! I shall be quite miserable if I don't
get in.
   [$ (^Dang.^) $] Then you must not lose a Moment.
[$ (^Exeunt Ladies.^) $]
   [$ (^Med.^) $] There they are gone. 
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] I am glad on't with all my Heart.
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Upon my Word, Mr. (^Medley^) , that last is
an exceeding good Scene, and full of a great deal of
Politeness, good Sense, and Philosophy.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] It's Nature, my Lord, it's Nature.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Faith, Sir, the Ladies are much oblig'd
to you.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Faith, Sir, it's more than I desire such
Ladies, as I represent here, shou'd be; as for the nobler
Part of the Sex for whom I have the greatest
Honour, their Characters can be no better set off, than
by ridiculing that light, trifling, giddy-headed Crew,
who are a Scandal to their own Sex, and a Curse
on ours.
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Gentlemen, you must make room, for the
Curtain must be let down, to prepare the 
Auction-Room.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] My Lord, I believe you will be best before
the Curtain, for we have but little Room behind,
and a great deal to do.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Upon my Word, Mr. (^Medley^) , I must ask
you the same Question which one of your Ladies did
just now; what do you intend to sell at this Auction,
the whole Stock in Trade of some Milliner or
Mercer who has left off Business?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, I intend to sell such things as was never
sold in any Auction before, nor ever will again; I
can assure you, Mr. (^Sowrwit^) , this Scene, which I
<P 14>
look on as the best in the whole Performance, will
require a very deep Attention; Sir, if you should take
one Pinch of Snuff during the whole Scene, you
will lose a Joke by it, and yet they lie pretty deep
too, and may escape Observation from a moderate
Understanding, unless very closely attended to.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] I hope, however, they don't lie as deep as
the dumb Gentleman's Politicks did in the first Act;
if so, nothing but an inspir'd Understanding can come
at 'em.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, this Scene is writ in Allegory, and tho'
I have endeavour'd to make it as plain as possible;
yet all Allegory will require a strict Attention to be
understood, Sir.
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Sir, every thing is ready.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Then draw up the Curtain -- Come, enter
Mrs. (^Screen^) , and Mrs. (^Barter^) .

[} (^The^) AUCTION.}]

[$SCENE (^an Auction-Room, a Pulpit and
Forms plac'd, and several People walking about,
some seated near the Pulpit^) .$]

[$ (^Enter Mrs.^) Screen (^and Mrs.^) Barter.$]

   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] Dear Mrs. (^Barter^) .
   [$Mrs. (^Bart.^) $] Dear Madam, you are early to-day?
   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] Oh, if one does not get near the 
Pulpit, one does nothing, and I intend to buy a great
deal to-day; I believe I shall buy the whole Auction,
at least if things go cheap; you won't bid against
me?
   [$Mrs. (^Bart.^) $] You know I never bid for any thing?

[$ (^Enter^) Banter (^and^) Dangle.$]

   [$ (^Bant.^) $] That's true, Mrs. (^Barter^) , I'll be your
Evidence.
<P 15>
   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] Are you come? now I suppose we
shall have fine Bidding; I don't expect to buy
cheaper than at a Shop.
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] That's unkind, Mrs. (^Screen^) , you know I
never bid against you; it would be cruel to bid against
a Lady who frequents Auctions, only with a Design
one Day or other to make one great Auction of her
own: No, no, I will not prevent the filling your
Warehouse; I assure you, I bid against no
Haberdashers of all Wares.
   [$Mrs. (^Bart.^) $] You are a mighty civil Person, truly.
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] You need not take up the Cudgels, Madam,
who are of no more Consequence at an Auction,
than a Mayor at a Sessions; you only come here
where you have nothing to do, to shew People you
have nothing to do any where else.
   [$Mrs. (^Bart.^) $] I don't come to say rude things to all
the World as you do.
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] No, the World may thank Heaven, that did
not give you Wit enough to do that.
   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] Let him alone, he will have his Jest?
   [$Mrs. (^Bart.^) $] You don't think I mind him, I hope;
but pray, Sir, of what great Use is your Friend,
Mr. (^Dangle^) , here?
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] Oh, he is of very great Use to all Women
of Understanding.
   [$ (^Dang.^) $] Ay! of what Use am I, pray?
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] To keep 'em at home, that they may not
hear the silly things you say to 'em.
   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] I hope, Mr. (^Banter^) , you will not
banish all People from Places where they are of no
Consequence; you will allow 'em to go to an Assembly,
or a Masquerade, without either Playing, Dancing or
Intriguing; you will let People go to an Opera
without any Ear, to a Play without any Taste, and to a
Church without any Religion?
<P 16>
[$ (^Enter Mr.^) Hen (^Auctioneer (bowing.) ^) $]

   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] Oh! dear Mr. (^Hen^) , I am glad you
are come, you are horrible late to-day.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Madam, I am just mounting the Pulpit; I
hope you like the Catalogue, Ladies?
   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] There are some good things here, if
you are not too dilatory with your Hammer.
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] Boy, give me a Catalogue?
   [$ (^Hen. in the Pulpit.^) $] I dare swear, Gentlemen and
Ladies, this Auction will give general Satisfaction;
it is the first of its kind which I ever had the
Honour to exhibit, and I believe I may challenge the
World to produce some of the Curiosities which this
choice Cabinet contains: A Catalogue of Curiosities
which were collected by the undefatigable Pains of that
celebrated Virtuoso, (^Peter Humdrum^) , Esq; which
will be sold by Auction, by (^Christopher Hen^) on 
(^Monday^) the 21st Day of (^March^) , beginning at Lot 1.
Gentlemen and Ladies, this is Lot 1. A most curious
Remnant of Political Honesty. Who puts it up,
Gentlemen? It will make you a very good Cloke,
you see its both Sides alike, so you may turn it as
often as you will -- Come, five Pounds for this
curious Remnant; I assure you, several great Men have
made their Birth-day Suits out of the same Piece -- It
will wear for ever, and never be the worse for 
wearing -- Five Pounds is bid -- no Body more than
five Pounds for this curious Piece of Political
Honesty, five Pound, no more -- [$ (^knocks.^) $] Lord
(^Both-Sides^) . Lot 2, a most delicate Piece of Patriotism,
Gentlemen, who bids? ten Pounds for this Piece of
Patriotism?
   [$1 (^Court.^) $] I would not wear it for a thousand Pound.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Sir, I assure you, several Gentlemen at Court
have worn the same; it's a quite different thing
within to what it is without.
<P 17>
   [$1 (^Court.^) $] Sir, it is prohibited Goods, I sha'nt run
the risque of being brought into (^Westminster-hall^) for
wearing it.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] You take it for the old Patriotism, whereas
it is indeed like that in nothing but the Cut, but
alas! Sir, there is a great Difference in the Stuff:
But, Sir, I don't propose this for a Town-Suit,
this is only proper for the Country; Consider,
Gentlemen, what a Figure this will make at an Election -- 
Come, five Pound -- One Guinea -- Put 
Patriotism by.
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] Ay, put it by, one Day or other it may be
in Fashion.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Lot 3. Three Grains of Modesty: Come,
Ladies, consider how scarce this valuable
Commodity is.
   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] Yes, and out of Fashion too, Mr. (^Hen^) .
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] I ask your Pardon, Madam, it is true (^French^)
I assure you, and never changes Colour on any
Account -- Half a Crown for all this Modesty -- Is
there not one Lady in the Room who wants any
Modesty?
   [$1 (^Lady.^) $] Pray Sir, what is it, for I can't see it at
this Distance?
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] It cannot be seen at any Distance, Madam, 
but it is a beautiful Powder, which makes a fine
Wash for the Complexion.
   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] I thought you said it was true (^French^) ,
and wou'd not change the Colour of the Skin?
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] No, it will not, Madam; but it serves
mighty well to blush behind a Fan with, or to wear
under a Lady's Mask at a Masquerade -- What, no
Body bid -- Well, lay Modesty aside -- Lot 4. One
Bottle of Courage, formerly in the Possession of
Lieutenant Colonel (^Ezekiel Pipkin^) , Citizen, Alderman
and Tallowchandler -- What, is there no Officer
of the Train'd-Bands here? Or it will serve an
Officer of the Army as well in Time of Peace, nay even
<P 18>
in War, Gentlemen; it will serve all of you who
fell out?
   [$1 (^Offi.^) $] Is the Bottle whole? is there no Crack
in it?
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] None, Sir, I assure you; tho' it has been in
many Engagements in (^Tothill-Fields^) ; nay it has serv'd
a Campaign or two in (^Hide-Park^) , since the
Alderman's Death -- it will never waste while you stay at
home, but it evaporates immediately if carried abroad.
   [$1 (^Offi.^) $] Damn me, I don't want it; but a Man
can't have too much Courage -- Three Shillings
for it.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Three Shillings are bid for this Bottle of
Courage.
   [$1 (^Beau.^) $] Four. 
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] What do you bid for Courage for?
   [$1 (^Beau.^) $] Not for my self, but I have a Commission
to buy it for a Lady.
   [$1 (^Offi.^) $] Five.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Five Shillings, five Shillings for all this
Courage; no Body more than five Shillings? [$ (^knocks.^) $]
your Name, Sir?
   [$1 (^Offi.^) $] (^Macdonald O Thunder.^) 
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Lot 5, and Lot 6. All the Wit lately
belonging to Mr. (^Hugh Pantomime^) , Composer of
Entertainments for the Play-houses, and Mr. (^William Goosequil^) ,
Composer of political Papers in Defence of a   
Ministry; shall I put up these together?
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] Ay, it is a pity to part them, where are
they?
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Sir, in the next Room, where any
Gentleman may see them, but they are too heavy to bring
in; there are near three hundred Volumes in Folio.
   [$ (^Ban.^) $] Put them by, who the Devil would bid for
them unless he was the Manager of some House or
other? The Town has paid enough for their Works
already.
<P 19>
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Lot 7. A very neat clear Conscience which
has been worn by a Judge, and a Bishop.
   [$Mrs. (^Screen.^) $] It is as clean as if it was new.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Yes, no Dirt will stick to it, and pray
observe how capacious it is; it has one particular
Quality, put as much as you will into it, it is never full:
Come, Gentlemen, don't be afraid to bid for this,
for whoever has it will never be poor.
   [$ (^Beau.^) $] One Shilling for it.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] O fy, Sir, I am sure you want it, for if you
had any Conscience, you would put it up at more
than that: Come, fifty Pound for this Conscience.
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] I'll give fifty Pound to get rid of my
Conscience with all my Heart.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Well, Gentlemen, I see you are resolv'd not
to bid for it, so I'll lay it by: Come, Lot 8, a very
considerable Quantity of Interest at Court; Come, a
Hundred Pound for this Interest at Court.
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] For me, Mr. (^Hen^) ?
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] A Hundred Pound is bid in a Hundred Places,
Gentlemen.
   [$ (^Beau.^) $] Two Hundred Pound.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Two Hundred Pound, two Hundred and
Fifty, three Hundred Pound, three Hundred and Fifty,
four Hundred, five Hundred, six Hundred, a
Thousand; a Thousand Pound is bid, Gentlemen, no Body
more than a Thousand Pounds for this Interest at
Court; no Body more than one Thousand? [$ (^Knocks.^) $]
Mr. (^Littlewit^) .
   [$ (^Ban.^) $] Damn me, I know a Shop where I can buy
it for less.
   [$L (^Dap.^) $] Egad, you took me in, Mr. (^Medley^) , I 
could not help bidding for it.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] It is a sure Sign it's Nature, my Lord, and
I should not be surpriz'd to see the whole Audience
stand up and bid for it too.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] All the Cardinal Virtues, Lot 9. Come,
Gentlemen, put in these Cardinal Virtues?
<P 20>
   [$ (^Gent.^) $] Eighteen Pence.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Eighteen Pence is bid for these Cardinal
Virtues; no body more than Eighteen Pence? Eighteen
Pence for all these Cardinal Virtues, no body more?
All these Virtues, Gentlemen, are going for Eighteen
Pence; perhaps there is not so much more Virtue in
the World, as here is, and all going for Eighteen
Pence [$ (^Knocks.^) $] Your Name, Sir?
   [$ (^Gent.^) $] Sir, here's a Mistake; I thought you had
said a Cardinal's Virtues, 'Sblood Sir, I thought to
have bought a Pennyworth; here's Temperance and
Chastity, and a Pack of Stuff that I would not give
three Farthings for?
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Well, lay 'em by, Lot 10, and Lot 11, A
great deal of Wit, and a little common Sense.
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] Why do you put up these together? they
have no Relation to each other.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Well, the Sense by itself; then Lot 10, A
little common Sense -- I assure you, Gentlemen, this
is a very valuable Commodity; Come, who puts it
in?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] You observe as valuable as it is, no body
bids; I take this, if I may speak in the Stile of a 
great Writer, to be a most emphatical Silence; you
see, Mr. (^Sowrwit^) , no one speaks against this Lot,
and the reason no body bids for it, is because every
one thinks he has it.
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Lay it by, I'll keep it my self; Lot 12.
[$ (^Drum beats.^) $]
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Hey-day! What's to be done, now,
Mr. (^Medley^) ?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Now, Sir, the Sport begins.

[$ (^Enter a Gentleman laughing.^) $]

[$ (^Huzza within.^) $]
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] What's the Matter?
   [$ (^Gent.^) $] There's a Sight without would kill all
Mankind with laughing; (^Pistol^) is run mad, and thinks
<P 21>
himself a great Man, and he's marching thro' the
Streets with a Drum and Fiddles.
   [$ (^Bant.^) $] Please Heaven, I'll go and see this Sight.
[$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] And so will I. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
   [$ (^Hen.^) $] Nay, if every one else goes, I don't know
why I shou'd stay behind. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Mr. (^Sowrwit^) , we'll go too.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] If your Lordship will have but a little
Patience 'till the Scene be chang'd, you shall see him
on the Stage.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Is not this Jest a little over-acted?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] I warrant, we don't over-act him half so much
as he does his Parts; tho' 'tis not so much his acting
Capacity which I intend to exhibit as his
ministerial.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] His ministerial!
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Yes, Sir, you may remember I told you
before my Rehearsal, that there was a strict
Resemblance between the States Political and Theatrical;
there is a Ministry in the latter as well as the former,
and I believe as weak a Ministry as any poor
Kingdom cou'd ever boast of; Parts are given in the
latter to Actors, with much the same Regard to
Capacity as Places in the former have sometimes been,
in former Ages I mean; and tho' the Publick damn
both, yet while they both receive their Pay, they
laugh at the Publick behind the Scenes; and if one
considers the Plays that come from one Part, and
the Writings from the other, one would be apt to
think the same Authors were retain'd in both: But,
come, change the Scene into the Street, and then
enter (^Pistol (\cum suis\) ^) -- Hitherto, Mr (^Sowrwit^) , as we
have had only to do with inferior Characters, such as
Beaux and Tailors, and so forth, we have dealt in the
Prosaick; now we are going to introduce a more
considerable Person, our Muse will rise in her Stile:
<P 22>
Now, Sir, for a Taste of the sublime; come, enter, 
(^Pistol^) . [$ (^Drum beats and Fiddles play.^) $]

[$ (^Enter^) Pistol (^and Mob^) .$]

   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Associates, Brethren, Countrymen and Friends,
Partakers with us in this glorious Enterprize,
Which for our Consort we have undertaken;
It grieves us much, yes by the Gods it does!
That we whose great Ability and Parts
Have rais'd us to this Pinacle of Power,
Entitling us Prime Minister Theatrical;
That we shou'd with an Upstart of the Stage
Contend succesless on our Consort's Side;
But tho', by just hereditary Right
We claim a lawless Power, yet for some Reasons,
Which to our self we keep as yet conceal'd:
Thus to the Publick, deign we to appeal;
Behold how humbly the Great (^Pistol^) kneels.
Say then, Oh Town, is it your Royal Will,
That my great Consort represent the Part
of (^Polly Peachum^) in the (^Beggar's Opera^) ?
[$ (^Mob hiss.^) $]
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Thanks to the Town, that Hiss speaks their
Assent;
Such was the Hiss that spoke the great Applause,
Our mighty Father met with, when he brought
His (^Riddle^) on the Stage; such was the Hiss,
Welcom'd his (^Caesar^) to the (^AEgyptian^) Shore;
Such was the Hiss, in which Great (^John^) shou'd have
expir'd:
But, wherefore do I try in vain to number
Those glorious Hisses, which from Age to Age
Our Family has born triumphant from the Stage?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Get thee gone for the prettiest Hero that ever
was shown on any Stage. [$ (^Exit^) Pistol.$]
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Short and sweet, faith, what, are we to have
no more of him?
<P 23>
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Ay, ay, Sir; he's only gone to take a little
Breath.
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] If you please, Sir, in the mean time, we'll
go take a little Fire, for 'tis confounded cold upon
the Stage.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] I wait upon your Lordship: Stop the
Rehearsal a few Moments, we'll be back again
instantly. [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]

[}ACT III. SCENE I.}]

[$ (^Enter^) Medley, Sowrwit (^and Lord^) Dapper.$]

   [$ (^Med.^) $] Now, my Lord, for my modern (^Apollo^) :
Come, make all things ready, and draw
the Scene as soon as you can.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Modern, why modern? You Common-Place
Satirists are always endeavouring to persuade us, that
the Age we live in, is worse than any other has been, 
whereas Mankind have differ'd very little since the
World began; for one Age has been as bad as 
another.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Mr. (^Sowrwit^) , I do not deny that Men have
been always bad enough; Vice and Folly are not
the Invention of our Age; but I will maintain, that
what I intend to ridicule in the following Scene, is
the whole and sole Production and Invention of some
People now living; and faith, let me tell you, 
tho' perhaps the Publick may not be the better for
it, it is an Invention exceeding all the Discoveries
of every Philosopher or Mathematician, from the
Beginning of the World to this Day.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Ay, pray what is it?
<P 24>
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Why, Sir, it is a Discovery lately found out,
that a Man of great Parts, Learning and Virtue, is
fit for no Employment whatever; that an Estate
renders a Man unfit to be trusted, that being a 
Blockhead is a Qualification for Business; that Honesty is
the only Sort of Folly for which a Man ought to be
utterly neglected and contemn'd. And -- But here
is the Inventor himself.

[$SCENE (^draws, and discovers^) Apollo (^in a great
Chair, surrounded by Attendants^) .$]

Come, bring him forward, that the Audience may
see and hear him: You must know, Sir, this is a 
Bastard of (^Apollo^) , begotten on that beautiful Nymph
(^Moria^) , who sold Oranges to (^Thespis's^) Company, or
rather Cart-load of Comedians; and being a great
Favourite of his Father's, the old Gentleman settled
upon him the entire Direction of all our Play-houses
and poetical Performances whatever.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Prompter.
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Sir.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Is there any thing to be done?
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Yes, Sir, this Play to be cast.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Give it me. The Life and Death of King
(^John^) , written by (^Shakespear^) : Who can act the 
King?
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] (^Pistol^) , Sir, he loves to act it behind the
Scenes.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Here are a parcel of (^English^) Lords.
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Their Parts are but of little Consequence,
I will take care to cast them.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Do but be sure you give them to Actors
who will mind their Cues -- (^Faulconbridge^) -- What
sort of a Character is he?
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Sir, he is a Warrior, my Cousin here
will do him very well.
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] I do a Warrior! I never learnt to fence.
<P 25>
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] No Matter, you will have no Occasion to
fight; can you look fierce, and speak well?
   [$1 (^Play.^) $] Boh!
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] I would not desire a better Warrior in the
House than your self -- (^Robert Faulconbridge^) -- What, 
is this (^Robert^) ?
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Really, Sir, I don't well know what he
is, his chief Desire seems to be for Land, I think;
he is no very considerable Character, any body may
do him well enough; or if you leave him quite out,
the Play will be little the worse for it.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Well, I'll leave it to you -- (^Peter^) of
(^Pomfret^) , a Prophet -- Have you any Body that looks
like a Prophet?
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] I have one that looks like a Fool.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] He'll do -- (^Philip^) of (^France^) .
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] I have cast all the (^French^) Parts, except the
Ambassador.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Who shall do it? His Part is but short, have
you never a good genteel Figure, and one that can
dance? for as the (^English^) are the politest People in
(^Europe^) , it will be mighty proper that the
Ambassador should be able at his Arrival to entertain them
with a Jig or two.
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Truly, Sir, here are Abundance of
Dancing-masters in the House, who do little or nothing
for their Money. 
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Give it to one of them; see that he has a
little Drollery tho' in him, for (^Shakespear^) seems to
have intended him as a ridiculous Character, and
only to make the Audience laugh.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] What's that, Sir? Do you affirm that
(^Shakespear^) intended the Ambassador (^Chatilion^) a ridiculous
Character?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] No, Sir, I don't.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Oh, Sir, your humble Servant, then I
misunderstood you; I thought I had heard him 
say so.
<P 26>
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Yes, Sir, but I shall not stand to all he
says.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] But, Sir, you shou'd not put a wrong
Sentiment into the Mouth of the God of Wit.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] I tell you, he is the God only of modern
Wit, and he has a very just Right to be God of
most of the modern Wits that I know; of some
who are lik'd for their Wit; of some who are
preferr'd for their Wit; of some who live by their
Wit; of those ingenious Gentlemen who damn Plays, 
and those who write them too perhaps. Here comes
one of his Votaries; come, enter, enter -- Enter
Mr. (^Ground-Ivy^) .

[$ (^Enter^) Ground-Ivy.$]

   [$ (^Ground.^) $] What are you doing here?
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] I am casting the Parts in the Tragedy of 
King (^John^) .
   [$ (^Ground.^) $] Then you are casting the Parts in a
Tragedy that won't do.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] How, Sir! Was it not written by (^Shakespear^) ,
and was not (^Shakespear^) one of the greatest Genius's 
that ever lived?
   [$ (^Ground.^) $] No, Sir, (^Shakespear^) was a pretty Fellow,
and said some things which only want a little of my
licking to do well enough; King (^John^) , as now writ, 
will not do -- But a Word in your Ear, I will make 
him do.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] How?
   [$ (^Ground.^) $] By Alteration, Sir, it was a Maxim of
mine, when I was at the Head of Theatrical Affairs,
that no Play, tho' ever so good, would do without
Alteration -- For instance, in the Play before us, the
Bastard (^Faulconbridge^) is a most effeminate Character,
for which reason I would cut him out, and put all
his Sentiments in the Mouth of (^Constance^) , who is so
much properer to speak them -- Let me tell you,
Mr. (^Apollo^) , Propriety of Character, Dignity of
<P 27>
Diction, and Emphasis of Sentiment are the things I
chiefly consider on these Occasions.
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] I am only afraid as (^Shakespear^) is so popular
an Author, and you, asking your Pardon, so
unpopular.
   [$ (^Ground.^) $] Damn me, I'll write to the Town and
desire them to be civil, and that in so modest a 
manner, that an Army of (^Cossacks^) shall be melted: I'll tell
them that no Actors are equal to me, and no Authors
ever were superior: And how do you think I can
insinuate that in a modest manner?
   [$ (^Promp.^) $] Nay, faith, I can't tell.
   [$ (^Ground.^) $] Why, I'll tell them that the former only
tread on my Heels, and that the greatest among the
latter have been damn'd as well as my self; and after
that, what do you think of your Popularity? I can
tell you, Mr. (^Prompter^) , I have seen things carried in
the House against the Voice of the People before to
Day.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] Let them hiss, let them hiss, and grumble as
much as they please as long as we get their Money.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] There, Sir, is the Sentiment of a great Man,
and worthy to come from the great (^Apollo^) himself.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] He's worthy his Sire, indeed, to think of
this Gentleman for altering (^Shakespear^) .
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, I will maintain this Gentleman as
proper as any Man in the Kingdom for the Business.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Indeed!
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Ay, Sir, for as (^Shakespear^) is already good
enough for the People of Taste, he must be alter'd to the
Palates of those who have none; and if you will grant
that, who can be properer to alter him for the worse?
But if you are so zealous in old (^Shakespear's^) Cause,
perhaps you may find by-and-by all this come to
nothing -- Now for (^Pistol^) .
<P 28>
[$Pistol (^enters, and overturns his Father^) .$]
   [$ (^Ground.^) $] Pox on't, the Boy treads close on my
Heels in a literal Sense.
   [$ (^Pist.^) $] Your Pardon, Sir, why will you not obey
Your Son's Advice, and give him still his way;
For you, and all who will oppose his Force,
Must be o'erthrown in his triumphant Course.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] I hope, Sir, your (^Pistol^) is not intended to
burlesque (^Shakespear^) .
   [$ (^Med.^) $] No, Sir, I have too great an Honour for
(^Shakespear^) to think of burlesquing him, and to be
sure of not burlesquing him I will never attempt to
alter him, for fear of burlesquing him by Accident, 
as perhaps some others have done.
   [$ (^Dap.^) $] (^Pistol^) is the young Captain.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] My Lord, (^Pistol^) is every insignificant
Fellow in Town, who fancies himself of great 
Consequence, and is of none; he is my Lord (^Pistol^) ,
Captain (^Pistol^) , Counsellor (^Pistol^) , Alderman (^Pistol^) ,   # 
Beau
(^Pistol^) , and -- and -- Odso, what was I going to say?
Come, go on.
   [$ (^Apol.^) $] (^Prompter^) , take care that all things well go  #
on;
We will retire, my Friend, and read King (^John^) .
[$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] To what purpose, Sir, was Mr. (^Pistol^)
introduced?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] To no purpose at all, Sir; it's all in
Character, Sir, and plainly shews of what mighty
Consequence he is -- And there ends my Article from the 
Theatre.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Hey-day! What's become of your two
(^Pollys^) ?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Damn'd, Sir, damn'd; they were damn'd at
my first Rehearsal, for which Reason I have cut them
out; and to tell you the Truth, I think the Town
has honour'd 'em enough with talking of 'em for a
whole Month; tho', faith, I believe it was owing to
their having nothing else to talk of. Well, now for
<P 29>
my Patriots -- You will observe, Mr. (^Sowrwit^) , that I
place my Politicians and my Patriots at opposite Ends
of my Piece, which I do, Sir, to shew the wide
Difference between them; I begin with my Politicians
to signify that they will always have the Preference
in the World to Patriots, and I end with Patriots to
leave a good Relish in the Mouths of my Audience.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Ay? by your Dance of Patriots, one would
think you intended to turn Patriotism into a Jest.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] So do I -- But don't you observe I conclude
the whole with a Dance of Patriots? which plainly
intimates that when Patriotism is turn'd into a Jest,
there is an End of the whole Play: Come, enter four
Patriots -- You observe I have not so many Patriots
as Politicians; you will collect from thence that they
are not so plenty.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Where does the Scene lie now, Sir?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] In (^Corsica^) , Sir, all in (^Corsica^) .

[$ (^Enter four^) Patriots (^from different Doors, who meet in
the Center and shake Hands^) .$]

   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] These Patriots seem to equal your greatest
Politicians in their Silence.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, what they think now cannot well be
spoke, but you may conjecture a great deal from their
shaking their Heads; they will speak by-and-by --
as soon as they are a little heated with Wine: You
cannot, however, expect any great Speaking in this
Scene, for tho' I do not make my Patriots
Politicians, I don't make them Fools.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] But, methinks, your Patriots are a Set of
shabby Fellows.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] They are the cheaper dress'd; besides, no
Man can be too low for a Patriot, tho' perhaps it
is possible he may be too high.
   [$1 (^Patr.^) $] Prosperity to (^Corsica^) . 
<P 30>
   [$2 (^Patr.^) $] Liberty and Property.
   [$3 (^Patr.^) $] Success to Trade.
   [$4 (^Patr.^) $] Ay, to Trade -- to Trade -- particularly to
my Shop.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Why do you suffer that Actor to stand
laughing behind the Scenes, and interrupt your
Rehearsal?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] O, Sir, he ought to be there, he's a
laughing in his Sleeve at the Patriots; he's a very
considerable Character -- and has much to do 
by-and-by.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Methinks the Audience shou'd know that,
or perhaps they may mistake him as I did, and hiss
him.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] If they shou'd, he's a pure impudent Fellow,
and can stand the Hisses of them all; I chose him
particularly for the Part -- Go on, Patriots.
   [$1 (^Patr.^) $] Gentlemen, I think this our Island of
(^Corsica^) is an ill State, I do not say we are actually in
War, for that we are not; but however we are
threaten'd with it daily, and why may not the
Apprehension of a War, like other Evils, be worse than
the Evil itself; for my part, this I will say, this I
will venture to say, That let what will happen I will
drink a Health to Peace.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] This Gentleman is the Noisy-Patriot, who
drinks and roars for his Country, and never does
either Good or Harm in it -- The next is the
Cautious-Patriot.
   [$2 (^Patr.^) $] Sir, give me your Hand; there's Truth in 
what you say, and I will pledge you with all my Soul,
but remember it is all under the Rose.
   [$3 (^Patr.^) $] Look'ee, Gentlemen, my Shop is my
Country, I always measure the Prosperity of the latter by
that of the former. My Country is either richer
or poorer, in my Opinion, as my Trade rises or falls;
therefore, Sir, I cannot agree with you that a War
<P 31>
wou'd be disserviceable: On the contrary I think it the
only way to make my Country flourish; for as I am
a Sword-Cutler, it would make my Shop flourish, so
here's to War.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] This is the Self-interested-Patriot, and now
you shall hear the fourth and last kind, which is the
Indolent-Patriot, one who acts as I have seen a
prudent Man in Company fall asleep at the beginning of 
a Fray, and never wake till the end on't.
   [$4 (^Patr. Waking.^) $] Here's to Peace or War, I do
not care which.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] So this Gentleman being neutral, Peace has
it two to one.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Perhaps neither shall have it, perhaps I have
found a way to reconcile both Parties: But go on.
   [$1 (^Patr.^) $] Can any one, who is a Friend to (^Corsica^) ,
wish for War, in our present Circumstances? -- I
desire to ask you all one Question, Are we not a Set of
miserable poor Dogs?
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] Ay, ay.
   [$3 (^Patr.^) $] That we are sure enough, that no body
will deny.

[$ (^Enter^) Quidam.$]

   [$ (^Quid.^) $] Yes, Sir, I deny it. [$ (^All start.^) $] Nay, 
Gentlemen, let me not disturb you, I beg you will all sit
down, I am come to drink a Glass with you -- Can
(^Corsica^) be poor while there is this in it? [$ (^Lays a Purse
on the Table.^) $] Nay, be not afraid of it, Gentlemen,
it is honest Gold I assure you; you are a set of poor
Dogs, you agree, I say you are not, for this is all
yours, there, [$ (^Pours it on the Table.^) $] take it among
you.
   [$1 (^Patr.^) $] And what are we to do for it?
   [$ (^Quid.^) $] Only say you are rich, that's all.
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] Oh, if that be all! [$ (^They snatch up    #
the Money.^) $]
<P 32>
   [$ (^Quid.^) $] Well, Sir, what is your Opinion now? tell
me freely.
   [$1 (^Patr.^) $] I will, a Man may be in the wrong through
Ignorance, but he's a Rascal who speaks with open
Eyes against his Conscience -- I own I thought we
were poor, but, Sir, you have convinc'd me that we
are rich.
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] We are all convinc'd.
   [$ (^Quid.^) $] Then you are all honest Fellows, and here
is to your Healths, and since the Bottle is out, hang
Sorrow, cast away Care, e'en take a Dance, and I
will play you a Tune on the Fiddle.
   [$ (^ (\Omnes.\) ^) $] Agreed.
   [$1 (^Patr.^) $] Strike up when you will, we are ready to
attend your Motions.
[$ (^Dance here^) ; Quidam (^dances out, and they all
dance after him^) .$]
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Perhaps there may be something intended by
this Dance which you don't take.
   [$ (^Sowr.^) $] Ay, what prithee?
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Sir, every one of these Patriots have a Hole in
their Pockets, as Mr. (^Quidam^) the Fiddler there knows,
so that he intends to make them dance till all the
Money is fall'n through, which he will pick up again, 
and so not lose one Half-penny by his Generosity;
so far from it, that he will get his Wine for nothing,
and the poor People, alas! out of their own Pockets,
pay the whole Reckoning. This, Sir, I think is a very
pretty Pantomime Trick, and an ingenious Burlesque on
all the Fourberies which the great (^Lun^) has exhibited in
all his Entertainments: And so ends my Play, my Farce,
or what you please to call it; may I hope it has your
Lordship's Approbation?
   [$L. (^Dap.^) $] Very pretty, indeed, it's very pretty.
   [$ (^Med.^) $] Then, my Lord, I hope I shall have your
Encouragement; for things in this Town do not always
succeed according to their Merit; there is a Vogue,
<P 33>
my Lord, which if you will bring me into, you will
lay a lasting Obligation on me: And you, Mr.
(^Sowrwit^) , I hope, will serve me among the Criticks, that
I may have no elaborate Treatise writ to prove that
a Farce of three Acts is not a regular Play of Five.
(^Lastly^) , to you Gentlemen, whom I have not the
Honour to know, who have pleas'd to grace my
Rehearsal; and you Ladies, whether you be (^Shakespear's^) 
Ladies, or (^Beaumont^) and (^Fletcher's^) Ladies, I hope you
will make Allowances for a Rehearsal;

And kindly all report us to the Town;
No borrow'd, nor no stol'n Goods we've shown,
If witty, or if dull, our Play's our own.
