[}ACT II. SCENE I.}] 

[$ (^Alicia, Lady, Servingman, Prentice.^) $]
   [$ (^Al.^) $] All Cheape-side, and Lombard-streete Madam,
could not have furnish'd you with a more
compleat bargaine, you will find it in the wearing, and thanke
me both for the goodnesse of the stuffe, and of the
Manufacture.
   [$ (^La.^) $] But now the price Mistris (^Saleware^) . I grant your
Commodity is good, The Gold and Silver Laces, and 
the Frienges are rich, and I hope well wrought. Has your
Man made a note of the particulars, and their prices, at
<P C2V>
the rate of ready-money (for I buy so) and not as you
would booke 'em to an under-ag'd heire, or a 
Court-Cavalier to expect payment two or three yeares hence;
and finde it perhaps never. I come with (^Here is one for
tother^) .
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I know your Ladiships payment such; And they are
priz'd so Madam to a farthing.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Let mee see, broad plate Silver and Gold-lace,
206 Ounces halfe, and a dram, at five and ten pence the
Ounce. 60 l. 5 s. 3 d. (^ob.^) 4. five and ten pence an Ounce 
is deare.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I protest unto you Madam that parcell of Lace for
a Bed as you intend it, was bespoken, and agreed for at
six shillings the Ounce by a very great person: but 
because ready money came not to fetch it off, Fortune
reserv'd it here for you, you could not have been so fitted
on the sodaine else within (^London^) walls; and I am glad
the same fortune was so favourable to me, as by my hands
to designe it for your Ladiships use and pleasure. I hope
Madam we shal hear of a young heir a comming shortly,
and that will make it a rich and fortunate Bed indeed;
And then Sir (^Olyver^) would thanke me too.
   [$ (^La.^) $] What a bold slut it is, well then the rest of the
particulars here of Laces [^SOURCE TEXT: Laees^] , and Frienges,     #
Loopes, and
Buttons, makes the sum of all an hundred pound eight
shillings foure pence, halfe-penny. I am no good
Arithmetician, but if any be overcast, and overpaid, you must
allow restitution.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Yes, good Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Is all put up into this Box?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] All Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Give mee my Purse. Take you home that while I
make payment for it; your Gold-weights Mistris
(^Saleware^) . [$ (^Exit Servant.^) $]
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Here Madam all in readinesse.
<P C3R>
   [$ (^La.^) $] You take no Gold but what is weight I presume.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] 'Tis but light paines to weigh it Madam. But let me
save your Ladiship that labour.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Nor shall it be your trouble, command your
Servant I pray for a glasse of your beere --
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Some beere for my Lady presently. [$ (^Exit.        #
Prentice.^) $]
   [$ (^La.^) $] That I may tell you in more privacy, what
perhaps you would not have him heare: for Prentises though
they are bound to keepe their Masters secrets, are not
all privy to their Mistresses; that's more a Journeymans
Office.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Your Ladiship is pleas'd.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Not very well with my selfe, for I have gone
beyond my Commission in this bargaine, and exceeded my
Husbands allowance. Here's one hundred pounds eight
shillings 4 d. (^ob.^) in the Bill, and he allowes me but the bare
hundred pound.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] The od money is but a small matter Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] A great matter in an honest poore Countrey
Ladies purse, may serve her a whole Christmas at Post and
Pare, or Farthing gleeke, when the gay Gamsters wives
o' the City may command the hundreds, out of the
purses of such poore Ladies Husbands. But here is the odd
money, eight shillings foure pence, half penny, and so all's
paid. 
   [$ (^Al.^) $] What meanes your Ladiship?
   [$ (^La.^) $] Doe you not understand mee then? I'le tell you
that which I thought fit to conceale from your servant;
And from your husband too had hee been here, perhaps
he knowes not on't. My husband left with you, or lent
you the last Terme a hundred pound, which hee assign'd
to me; and now I have it in Commodity. Had you
forgot it, when it was to do you a good turne, when your
absent husband faild you, and you wanted it.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] A good turne Madam?
<P C3V>
   [$ (^La.^) $] Yes, was it not to have the free use of a hundred 
pound ready money, a whole quarter of a yeare, through
a dead Vacation, and at last to take it out in wares? A
good turne I thinke for a Trades-woman; take heed you
do not by your sullennesse make me suspect another kind
of good turne, or that you did my husband any to my
injury, nor deny the receipt of his money, lest I take up
a violence that will not become mee, nor you be able to
beare. Be therefore well advis'd both in what you say,
and who heares me. Somebody comes.
[$ (^Enter Prentice with Beere.^) $]
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Madam your Beere.
   [$ (^La.^) $] I'le pledge you Mistris (^Saleware^) .
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I shall presume then Madam -- [$ (^Drinks.^) $]
   [$ (^La.^) $] This was right cast, was it not friend?
   [$ (^Pre.^) $] Your Ladyship will finde it so -- [$ (^La.         #
Drinks.^) $]
   [$ (^Al.^) $] And I hope you will finde your money so well
bestowd Madam, that you will vouchsafe always to know
the Shop.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Ever upon the like occasion, Mistris (^Saleware^) , #
so
most kindly farwell sweet Mistris (^Saleware^) .
   [$ (^Al.^) $] The humblest of your servants Madam. Open the
Boot for my Lady.
   [$ (^La.^) $] 'Tis done, my Coach-man does it. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I would the Devill were in your Coachmans Coat
to take his carriage for his paines. [$ (^Lady returnes.^) $]
   [$ (^La.^) $] One word more Mistris (^Saleware^) , can it be he?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Lay your comands on me good Madam. [$ (^Curtsie.^) $]
   [$ (^La.^) $] Not to your trouble, I perceive a young
Gentleman attends for conference with you. Is not his name
(^Fitzgerrard^) ?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] No Madam, his name is (^Bellamie^) , much
depending on the young Lord (^Lovely^) .
   [$ (^La.^) $] I thought I had known him, hee is a handsome
youth. I cannot blame you now with him: but beware 
<P C4R>
of old Knights that have young Ladies of their owne.
Once more adieu sweet Mistris (^Saleware^) . [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Most courteous Madam -- and once more to the
Devill. But on my life her chast Ladiship is taken with
this beard-lesse (^Bellamie^) . How shee shot eyes at
him!
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Now may your servant obtaine a hearing
Lady.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] My eares are open Sir.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] But you are sad or angry, why seemes that brow
to threaten a subjection over him that is your vanquish'd
captive; or has (^Cupid^) plac'd his Bow there bent at me,
whose heart already lodges all his Arrowes, never to be
restor'd but by your pity?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Fie, fie upon't! what talke is this? I am vex'd, and
you would mad me.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] What has displeas'd you?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] A crosse businesse that has happened in my Shop
to day, I being none of the wisest Chapwoman, have
undersold a parcell of the best Commodities my husband
had. And should hee know't wee should have such a
scwable.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Husbands should be so serv'd that do impose
Those mercenary Offices on their wives.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Talke so, and I will heare you, your amorous notes
sound like Play-speeches.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Servile, nay slavish Offices, ranking their wives
with their prentises.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] They pretend onely that wee should over-looke
our servants, when they but set us there for shew to draw
in custome: but in making us such over-seers they are
overseene themselves; Shopkeepers-wives will be
medling and dealing in their kinde, and as they are able, as wel
as their husbands (some much better, and more
profitable) but I was overreach'd I confesse.
<P C4V>
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] For no great matter I hope.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] No, the matter was not much (that never fretted 
me) but the manner has eene kild a Shee shop-keeper.
I cannot be long-liv'd, here under a Pent-house, as my
Lord (you know) told mee when he said he would shut
mee out of this servitude, and that I should change my
Coat, though my husband could not, before hee were an
Alderman, and be rank'd with Ladies.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] My Lord has still the same regard of you.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] So it appeares by the Tailor and the Mercer, whom
he sent foure dayes since to measure me out, and sute mee
to his Honour, and no returne of them found, yet his
Land might ha' beene measur'd all and sold, while a
poore sute is dreampt on, had he borne the mind of some
Lord?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I doubt not but this paper will cleare that
jealousie. And while you reade I'le speake that which I
dare not utter through, Sighes and Blushes to an intire
attention.
I am of Noble-blood my selfe, free-borne,
And not without good education;
But since I am ingag'd in this imployment,
And made an instrument of others lust,
I finde my selfe a scandall to my Name,
To Honour, and to Vertue, the base blot
Of Pandare sticking on me. But not this
Alone is my affliction. Here's my torment,
That while I doe true service to my Lord
(Whom I must ever honour) in my Agency
Unto your selfe (whom I cannot but love)
I finde my selfe a Traytor to his trust,
In my negotiation for my selfe.
Nor can I finde it possible to desist,
Mine own attempts, to you, or forbeare to urge
Your constancy to him.
<P C5R>
   [$ (^Al.^) $] How easie a worke
'Twere for one woman to supply 'em both,
And hold her husband play to levell Acoile,
A wooden two-leav'd booke, a paire of Tables
Would do't.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] How wretched is that suppliant, who must make
Sute to obtaine that, which he feares to take!
   [$ (^Al.^) $] At the beare at the Bridge-foot six a clock, good.
Sir, I finde my Lords honorable appointments here, and
have heard you all this while.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Now I could wish, and was in hope you had
not.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I will not blame you on your Lords behalfe;
Because you have enough rebuk'd your selfe.
But Sir, if you presume upon the favour
I give your Lord, and therefore to obtaine me,
Cause I am his, you undervalue me
To thinke that I can stoop unto his servant,
Though almost his Companion, you may thinke
After that degradation by degrees,
I may, in time, descend unto his Footman, I'me no cast
Garment of his Lordships yet.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] You have school'd mee fairely, I am humbled,
Lady -- [$ (^Going.^) $]
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Dee heare, dee heare sir, Mr. (^Bellamine^) , 
One word before you goe.
   [$ (^Pren.^) $] What would hee buy Mistris? can you take his
money?
Sir dee heare?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Pray attend you the tother end o' th' Shop,
If I cannot handle a Customer, why dos your Master
trust mee? Could a frowne fright you? Let a smile then
cheare you.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] And that's a heavenly one,
As that of (^Cynthia^) at (^Endymion^) .
<P C5V>
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Pray leave your Player-like passionate expressions.
And if you love mee, like a Man speake to me.
As I am a Woman; are you silent? if you doubt the 
length of my mans Eares at that distance, you may
whisper what so? But that is a right shop-whisper indeed
with Trades-women that are handsome; Is that the
most you will give sir? Could I afford it so, doe you
thinke I'd make two words w'ye? yet this before you
goe -- [$ (^Kisse.^) $] Now match it for the price I'le give it 
you for nothing.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I shall forget I have a Lord. I must forget him
here.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Doe so, and if (I say) you love mee, speake
plainely what you would have mee doe, or what you
would doe with mee (I love to dant these young things
that love before they can love to the purpose, or speake
to't handsomely like a Boy that would faine be
shooting at wild-fowle, before hee knowes how to discharge
a Birding-piece) I would heare you speake, you have
often muttered and fribled some intentions towards me,
but I would heare you speake. Come, if you love me lay
by the feare of the Lord that sent you, and tell me
roundly now, what you would have me doe?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I would intreat you --
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Well; what?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] That you would be pleas'd --
   [$ (^Al.^) $] With what? or to doe what?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] To weare this paire of Silke stockins for me.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Is that all your sute, 'tis granted, with my thanks
to you; Have you no more to say?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Yes, I say you are the beautifull'st of Women;
and that my Lord in your enjoyment is the
happiest --
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Nay thinke not of your Lord, but aske me, 
something.
<P C6R>
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I would but dare not hope for such a favour,
you'l never grant it, my unworthinesse.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] How can you tell?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] You will not wrong my Lord, so as to doe it.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Not in his sight perhaps. What is it? come.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] It is --
   [$ (^Al.^) $] It is then, let it be so. Go to Schoole child.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] It is -- That you would, let me -- give you this   #
ring,
And grace it with your Finger.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Will that be a wrong to your Lord?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Yes, to weare any favours, but his own.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Dos he know this?
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] No, nor I would not that he should (and given by
me) for all the Rubies in Cheapside, where I bought this
but now, over the way.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Come sir, I'le dally w'ye no longer, I know what
you would have with me.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] And now you will betray me: I am sham'd then
and undone.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] No, but I have you o' the hip. 'Tis plaine you
would lie with me: deny it if you can.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] O deare, did I say so now?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] What need you when I know it, you would lie
with me, and you shall. Take courage man.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] But, in good earnest, shall I? shall I?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Yes, in good earnest, you'l finde it no trifling
businesse, when you come to't once. But sir, upon
condition.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Any condition Lady.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] All purpose on't is lost, and all comes out else.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Name your condition, I'le performe it if it be in 
the power of my life.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] You saw here at your comming a faire Lady.
   [$ (^Bell.^) $] I tooke no notice of her.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] But she did of you, she is calld the Lady           # 
(^Thrivewell^) .
<P C6V>
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Sir (^Oliver Thrivewells^) Lady?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] The same, you have known her it seemes.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] Seene her before shee was married.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I will be briefe with you, as you love mee shee
loves you as eagerly, but with much more boldnesse, you
saw her whisper mee, and how loth shee was to depart,
when her eye was upon you.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] I did observe it.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Shee is my noble friend, and the sweetest Lady,
I need not set her out. But though you thinke you suffer
in your honour, in being an instrument twixt your Lord
and mee, with the base blot of Pander sticking on you,
(these were your words) I have ingag'd my selfe for
her to be your Pandaresse; be so, I shall be even with you
in businesse if you account it so.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] What dee meane Lady?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] To urge against my selfe, for that sweete Lady,
which no Woman else I thinke would doe, that loves
you so unfainedly as I. But 'tis my fate, and the
injunction I must lay upon you, to make mee yours. That first
you give your selfe to her Embraces; I'le give you means
for your accesse to her, and your successe with her,
which done, and on your faith affirm'd to mee, 'tis so,
I will perpetually bee yours more freely then your
Lords.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] You urge this but to try my constancy.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] For that I'le satisfie you soon, my husband coming
we must to night at the Beare --
My Lord writes so.
[$ (^Enter Saleware.^) $]
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] And there I will direct you in your progresse.
(^Ally^) how dost? Mr. (^Bellamy^) how ist? How dos my
noble Lord? You are sad methinks. Ha' you overbought
any thing here, and so repent your bargaine? Or cannot
my wife, and you agree upon't? you must use Mr. (^Bellamy^)
<P C7R>
kindly my sweet (^Ally^) : hee is our noblest Lords most
speciall favorite, and must finde all faire dealing here, as
well when I am abroad as at home sweet heart.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] You heare not mee complaine sir, fare you
well. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] What an Affinego's this! He might ha' thank'd
mee for my good words, though I meant him no good
will, I hope thou hast overreach'd him indeed.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] (^Thomas^) your hopes are vaine, (^Thomas^) in      #
seating
mee here to overreach, or underreach any body. I am 
weary of this Mechanick course (^Thomas^) ; and of this
courser habit, as I have told you divers and sundry times
(^Thomas^) , and indeed of you (^Thomas^) that confine me to't,
but the bound must obey.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Never the sooner for a hasty word, I hope sweete
(^Ally^) ; Not of me nor of my shop I prethee at seasonable
times Love. But for thy habit (though this be decent on
a Citizens wife) use thine owne fancy, let it be as
Courtly, or as Lady-like as thou pleasest, or my Lords
desires.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Then I am friends agen.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Troth, and I'le call thee friend, and I prethee, let
that be our familiar and common compellation: friend
it will sound daintily, especially when thou shalt appeare
too gallant to be my Wife.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Sa.^) ^] Then let it be so friend.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Al.^) ^] Intruth it shall, and I  #
am very much taken with
it. Friend I have found a Customer to day that will
take off my rich parcell of broad Bed-lace, that my
Lord (^Paylate^) bespoke, and left on my hands, for lack of
money.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I have sold it already friend, with other Laces at
a good rate.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] And all for ready money friend?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Yes friend, a hundred pounds, and somewhat more.
<P C7V>
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Who would be, or who could live without such
a friend, in such a shop? This money comes so pat for a 
present occasion, to stop a gap. It has stopt a gap already
friend.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I have dispos'd of the money, the odd hundred
pound for apparrell, friend, and other accommodations
for my selfe.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Never the sooner for a hasty word I hope
friend.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] I have done it friend, whereby to appeare more
Courtly, and Ladilike as you say, to gaine you more
custome to your Shop.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Uuch friend -- Is it so?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] And friend you must not be angry, or thinke much
of it, if you respect your profit friend.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] I were no friend but a wretch if I would. No let
it goe friend, and -- (^ (\Sapientia mea mihi\) ^) is my word, I
must not grudge at my friend in any thing.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Then friend, let your shop be your own care for
the rest of this day, I have some busines abroad.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Whither sweet friend?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Is that a friendly question?
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] I am corrected friend, but will you not take a
Man to wait upon you?
   [$ (^Al.^) $] To watch me, shall I? and give you account of my
actions? was that spoke like a friend?
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] I am agen corrected friend,
Doe your own pleasure, you'l returne to supper.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Yet againe?
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] And agen, I am corrected friend.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] Neither to supper, nor to bed perhaps.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Never the sooner for a hasty word I hope.
   [$ (^Al.^) $] But if I chance to stay, you cannot be a faithfull
friend and aske mee where, or in what company, 
friendship you know allowes all liberty. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
<P C8R>
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] (^ (\Sapientia mea mihi.\) ^) A wity wife, with an
imperious will,
Being crost, findes meanes to crosse her Husband still;
And Tradesmen that so match, must not with Gall
Temper their wives, but sweetly by wit-all. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
[$ (^Enter Carelesse, with two Letters in his hand, and Wat
with a Candle, and Wax.^) $]
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Dos not the World come finely on, (^Wat^) , ha?
And have not wee convenient commings in already,
ha! [$ (^Shew Gold.^) $]
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Better then wee know how to have payd, for
that's the glory on't.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I need no more insconsing now in (^Ram alley^) ,
nor the Sanctuary of (^White-fryers^) , the Forts of
(^Fullers-rents^) , and (^Milford-lane^) , whose walls are dayly     #
batter'd
with the curses of bawling creditors. My debts are payd;
and here's a stock remayning of Gold, pure Gold harke
how sweetly it chincks. [$ (^Carless seals his Letters.^) $]
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Yes, and 'twill ring the changes shortly.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] For necessaries (^Wat^) , for necessaries it shall #
change,
and Ring all out, and 'twil so long as I have an Unkle, and
know to mannage him, let money flie,
I can no faster spend then he supply.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] For necessaries sir, but you must not now count Sack
and Tobacco, Whores and Fidlers in abundance,
necessaries.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Why pray?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Because you'l have but little then for
extraordinaries, That is to say in a Gentleman for charitable, and
pious works and uies.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] The fellow's spoy'ld.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Not spoy'ld neither: For I would but wave your
purpose of flying at all new Game, and neglect your
poore whore, who now begins to be so violent for
<P C8V>
wrongs, shee can no longer beare, that shee intends to
pursue you with her complaints hither to your Unkles
House.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] My Unkles House? my house. Is not the first
Mornings draught mine?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] With great reason, for you are first dry in the
morning.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Is not the question first ask'd mee, what will you
have to breakfast? what will please you for Dinner,
and what for Supper? Has not my Unkle let out
monies, and taken Bonds and Morgages in my name? doe
not his Tenants crowch to mee, and his servants all call
me young Master? And dos not my Unkle take care to
marry mee to ten thousand pound, and a thing like a 
wife?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] You have got a brave possession here, I must
needs say; and I applaud your fortune most in this, that
your young Aunt the noble Lady here, who you see
feard would prove a cruell Stepdame to you, appeares
to be more friend to you then your Unkle. 'Tis a most
gracious Sun-shine in her.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Shee shall lose nothing by't. I have thought a 
way to requite her.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] But sir, for Mistris (^Phebe^) , will you take no
order for the poore soule?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I do not like your zealous solicitation, but her's
an order for her, in answer of her Malipert Letter you
brought me last night. Give it her, and these five pieces,
upon condition that shee never come, write, or send to
me againe, till I send to her.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] That's somewhat hard Sir.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Nay look you (^Wat^) , you are a little mistaken in
me. I must give over whoring, for speciall causes
thereunto me moving.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] O now I finde you. And 'twere richly worth
<P D1R>
your patience, if you could winne the Widow by't, for
whom you stood in faire election once, untill your last
debauchment.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I shall stand fairer for her sir, when I leave
working but a weeke or two, shall I not?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Yes, if you leave it quite, but to forsake her
whom you have brought low, to fall to others, were such
a thing -- 
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Well sir, it may be I will, it may be I wo'nt,     #
what's
that to you? carry you the Letter, and the Money, and try
how that will worke with her.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] I'le doe my best, but if shee should exclaime,
and bring on her Cosen Mr. (^Saleware^) to bee
clamorous --
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Her Cozen's a Cuckold, exclaime and clamorous!
give me my money againe.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Nay I am gone sir. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
[$ (^Enter Saveall.^) $]
   [$ (^Car.^) $] The Rogue's in faction with 'em; O noble
Mr. (^Saveall^) , you have most fairely kept your minute with
me, I have written my Letter, seald it and all, here to the
Widow.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] So early? that is well.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I have written no lesse then six large Epistles
this morning, and sent 'em now by my Man to be
convey'd into the Country to Lords and Knights, with all
the news spirituall, and temporall, forraine and
domestick that could possibly fall into a private Gentlemans
Collection.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] Is it possible?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] With such dexterity, that if I would make a
Trade on't, I could undoe all the Newes-mongers in
Town that live by't.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] It is a most commendable practise in a 
Gentleman, and it will mature your judgement in the both
<P D1V>
Common-wealth and State affaires, and in short time
invite you unto the chaire of (^Helme^) .
   [$ (^Car.^) $] When I am once married, and setled, you shall
see what an asse 'tis, he believes me.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] How am I comforted in my Meditation for you,
and how over-joy'd will your Unkle be at the use you
make of your retirements!
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I confesse it is (by reason of my unwontednesse
to it) some difficulty for me to write to women;
wherefore since you have so nobly undertaken the conveyance
of this, let me beseech you to apologize for the rudenes
of my stile.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] (^To the faire hands of the most acomplish'd in
vertue Mistris^) Anne Crostill, (^present, I pray with my service^) ;
The out-side hath no rudenesse on it, and (I doubt it
not) shee shall finde within all sweetenesse and
urbanity.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] As you may interpret it to her sir.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] Sir, what I have already said, and do intend to
say unto her from your Unkle, and my selfe on your
behalfe, together with what you have here written, shall
(I doubt it not) prepare so faire a way of proceeding for
you; That at your visit of her you may say, (^ (\veni, vidi,         #
vici\) ^) ,
she is your own.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] And then -- a ha, Mr. (^Saveall^) !
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] Expect your fortune modestly, and when it comes
embrace it with discretion.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Sir, I am edified.
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] It is well if you be so; I will put my undertaking
in action presently, Pray for my good successe.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I dare not tell him now I cannot; but I wish well
for the Monies sake; and let the Vintners pray, and all
the decay'd Sparks about the Towne, whom I will raise
out of ashes into flame againe. Let them pray for my
good wokes. O my young Lady aunts grave waiting
<P D2R>
Woman. If shee were not hers, and out of this
house I should take her for a Bawd now. But being
hers, and here how much may I mistake? all flesh is
frayle.

[$ (^Enter Nurse with Candle cup.^) $]

   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Not to disturbe your morning Meditations, my
Lady has sent you --
   [$ (^Car.^) $] And you have brought me, what sweet Mistris
(^Closet^) ?
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] A part of her Ladiships own breakfast, it is very
cordiall and comfortable to the spirits, I assure you,
and delectable to the younger sort, and profitable to
the old.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] One of (^Robert Greenes^) workes, or the mad
Doctor that preaches boyld in't I thinke.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] 'Tis a composition of mine owne Sir, of many
excellent decoctions, of most wholesome restorative, and
costly ingredients.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] That it was sent by her makes it more
excellent, whose bounteous care of me, I must acknowledge
exceeds all cost in carving to me, and countenancing me
at her Table, in gracing me in presence of the Ladies
that come to visit her; in giving charge for decency in
all things for my Chamber, my fires shining, my odours
burning, my livery serv'd in, my soft and costly bed
prepar'd and spread with perfum'd linnen -- here's
Ambergreece in this now --
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] O is it so, doe you finde that?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] But though shee is my own Unkles wife, I could
e'ne say 'tis pity a young man had her not.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] What a wag's this?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Shee is a most sweet Lady.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Shee is a sweete Lady indeed, I can best speake
<P D2V>
it that have knowne her from the wombe hitherto: A
sweete infant shee was borne, and a sweete babe I
swadled it, and a sweete child I nurs'd it, I traynd it up a
sweete child. It was in manners a sweet child, at her
Booke and Sample a sweet child. I never whipt it but 
once, and then it was sweete too, and sprawl'd but a
little, and whimper'd but a little it was so sweet a child;
And so shee grew upwards, and upwards towards
woman, and a sweet youngling shee was, and so grew 
upwards and upwards towards man, and then a sweete
Bride shee was, and now a most sweet Lady shee is,
(as you say, and I commend you for it) And so she stands
at a stay. For now shee growes no more upwards then
upon her Wedding day, not upwards as I would have
her upwards, here I meane young Gentlemen, could I
but see a sweet babe of hers once by my Master, I could
be then content to sleep with my Ancestors.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I had rather see your Gibship hang'd up with
Polcatts in a Warren, and your sweet Lady with you,
though I confesse that were some pitty. I hope her
barrennesse, or his will preserve her from my curse.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] I hope still, and shee hopes still; and I make
him of this broth for every morning, and many other
good strengthning things (I cannot say for the same
purpose) for I shall never see him have an heire by
her.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Excellent! that's best of all.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Because you then are heire, say you so? Is that
your love to your Aunt?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] No I protest (^Nurse^) , I meant by the broth, the 
bottome was the best of all.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Then I cry mercy.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Cannot all thy art, and her cost finde helpe for
my Unkle, think'st thou, to get a child?
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Helpe! what dee meane. He might have helpe
<P D3R>
and helpes enough, were she not too vertuous.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Still thou mistak'st me (^Nurse^) .
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Away wag away, your Aunt loves you too well
to thinke so of her.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] (^Nurse^) as I hope to inherit any thing 
hereafter --
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] I should but serve you well to tell her your
good thought of her.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] (^Nurse^) , by this good -- peece I thinke no
harme.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Nay, nay.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Take it I say. And tell her if thou wilt, that I
love her so well, that were shee not mine Unkles
wife, I would get her an heire my selfe rather then be
his. 
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Kinde young Master, now I am heartily sorry
that I mov'd you.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] And for my Unkle were I his heire apparent, I
rather wish he might live till all this World were weary
of him, and the next affraid to take him.
Then I survive him (Tongue [^SOURCE TEXT: Tonuge^] , a pox punish    #
you for lying)
Now I live well, and merily good (^Nurse^) ,
Wealth and Estates, bring cares and troubles with 'em,
Were all young heires of my contented mind,
Parents and Patrons would be better prayd for.

   [$ (^Nur.^) $] O my Lady calls.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Present my thanks and best respects unto her.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] I should ha' told you first -- I ha' forgot. My
head is naught,
   [$ (^Car.^) $] What member hast thou good then?
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] My Lady desires you -- This talke has put me
out -- O this head! My Lady desires you --
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Desires shee me (^Nurse^) ?
<P D3V>
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Yes sir, shee desires you.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Refuse me if I desire not her as much, for all she
is my Unkles leavings.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] My Lady desires you.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] And shee shall have me (^Nurse^) -- And she were
ten Unkles wives, and she ten of mine Aunts.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] O this head! nay now you will not heare
mee, shee desires you to goe abroad in the Coach
with her.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Any whither, to (^Islington, Newington, 
Padington, Kensington^) , or any of the City out-leaps (I know 'em 
all) for a spirt and back againe, tell her I am up and 
ready for her, and could ha' been without her stirrup
porredge, though I thanke her for her care. A man can
not be too well prepar'd, or provided for so sweete a
Lady, in so much distresse. A very (^Andromeda^) , chain'd

   [$ (^Nur.^) $] What's this you say? I understand no word of it,
I would take your answer right, though I falter'd in my
Ladies message.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] The Devills in this overruning Tongue of mine,
I could finde in my heart to worme him out with my
teeth.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] What must I tell my Lady Sir?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] That I am more oblig'd to her Ladiship then I
was to my Mother, shee has brought mee a new man
into the World, and that my Being and my Life is
hers.
[$ (^Enter Lady^) $]
   [$ (^La.^) $] I hope hee's a true convertite, did I send you to
hold discourse here, Closet?
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Nor did I Madam, but I could heare this 
Gentleman a whole day methinks. Hee speakes so
acknowledgingly of your Ladiships vertue, and goodnesse
towards him.
<P D4R>
   [$ (^La.^) $] I am beholding to him, will you goe with mee
Nephew to the Exchange? I am to buy some toyes there
for the Country, you may get a fancy by't.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Good, I must weare her favours.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Or cannot you forbeare your study so long?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] To doe you service Madam, under whose
commands I build my happinesse.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Be not at the distance of complement with mee
good Nephew.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I would not be thought insolent deare Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Come the Coachman grumbles at my stay, and
'twill be Dinner-time presently, so the Cooke will be
angry too.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] You are all tendernesse to your servants
Madam. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] A sweete Gentleman, and bountifull, if my
Lady had been blest with such a Husband, what a place
had I had! [$ (^ (\Exeunt omnes.\) ^) $]

[}ACT III. SCENE I.}]

[$ (^Enter Crostill reading a Letter, Saveall.^) $]
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] Doe you know the contents Mr. (^Saveall^) of the
familiar Epistle you have brought me here?
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] No Lady, but I guesse it a faire expression of the
Writers affection to you, although hee desired mee to
crave your pardon for the rudenesse of his stile, it
being the first that hee hath composed of that
consequence.
<P D4V>
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] Ha, ha, ha, I'le trust you sir, with the full
knowledge of it, pray read it your selfe.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] I finde shee is pleased, and my indeavour
prosperous, for the young Gentleman, I am sorry that I
delaid a day in the delivering of it.
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] Pray read it out sir, for I finde it so pleasant  #
that
I could heare it a whole day together.
[$ (^Reades.^) $]
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] (^In the first place you shall give mee leave to
wonder at your impudence (though it be but in your
dreames) to have a thought that I ever intended, or can
be drawne by perswasion, force, or the power of
witchcraft to marry you^) --
Blesse mee! sure if hee writ this, the Devill dictated
to him.
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] On sir, that's but his first charge.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] (^Secondly, I am to tell you, that I am warme
in mine Unkles favour. And 'tis not a peece a time,
or five peeces for a peece of pleasure can undoe mee;
and so I can have change, and scape the captivity of
Wedlock.^) 
This could no otherwise be done but by the Devill that
ought him the shame.
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] What follows I pray, there's the first and second
point past? marke his method.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] Thirdly, and lastly, let mee advise you, since
you are so hot upon Marriage, though I assure my
selfe you love none but mee, (and I thanke you for't)
that you fraine or dissemble an affection to some one of 
the City, who is but comparative to your selfe in blood
and fortune, and so you may make by-use of me as your
friend, and have children like me,
(^George Carelesse^) .
<P D5R>
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] Have you ever heard so queint a Love Letter?
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] Lady, the injury done in it, to your selfe is
unanswerable, but my wrong in being his Messenger, I will
make him answer.
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] Excuse me Sir, he has done me a favour; I pray
informe him so with my great thankes. But for what
you conceive a wrong to your selfe, use your discretion,
you have no more to say to me for him at this present,
have you sir?
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] Not for him but against him, I will un-say all that
I sayd before intended for his good.
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] But i'le not heare you wrong your former love,
and judgement of him so, which made so deepe
impression here, that I had lock'd his love up as a Jewell in
my Breast, and you in striving now to wrest it thence
may breake the Cabinet; I rather wish you'l be a 
friendly meanes to draw his presence hither, that I my self may
mildly question him.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] Are you serious Lady?
   [$ (^Cros.^) $] I feare I shall not rest before I see him, but doe
not tell him that, lest in this sullen humour, hee force his
absence to afflict mee more; I'le hold you sir no
longer, deale for me as you can, I know you have a guesse at 
my desire.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] I'le doe you service in it. [$ (^Exit Crostill.^) $]
I guesse that her desire is to doe some act of Revenge
upon him. And (so it be not mortall) it were but
Justice in her for so grosse a scorne by him cast upon a well
reputed Gentleman. Yet is it observ'd in her that shee
has a violent humour to do, and not to doe things
oftentimes wilfully against all good councell or perswasion,
shee has the spirit of contradiction in her, and an
unalterable resolution upon sodaine intentions, a most
incorrigible will shee has that will not bow nor breake. This
crosse abusive Letter therefore may doe good upon her,
<P D5V>
however mischievous hee might intend it. If shee meant
well to him before, it may the faster bring her on, but it
amazes me that hee should write so, bearing his Unkle,
and my selfe in hand, that hee so fairely lov'd her, and
besought us to negotiate with her for him, should shee
forgive it, yet the wrong to us in his vile manners is
unpardonable, and so sir, I come to you.
[$ (^Enter Carelesse.^) $]
   [$ (^Car.^) $] O Mr. (^Saveall^) --
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] What mischiefe or despight have I e're done you,
That could provoke your desperate spleene against mee,
To wound mine honour?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] What doe you meane good sir?
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] You have employed mee basely, made mee your
Carrier of scandall, and scurrility to the hands
Of noblenesse and vertue. Could the Fiend
Lust that is in you suffer you to write
No other Sense or Language to a person
Of her faire Name, and Worth, then such as Ruffians
Would send to strumpets? or it being such.
[$ (^Enter Wat.^) $]
Could not a Porter, or your Pandare there
Serve for the lewd conveyance?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] [^NO CHARACTER NAME GIVEN IN SOURCE TEXT.^] What a #
welcom's that!
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] You might safer
Ha' sent it so, and your own right hand with it;
Then to have drawn my just revenge upon you. [$ (^Draws.^) $]
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Hold I beseech you, and sir, though I lose the
Widow by my error (which was indeed but a meere
accident) let mee not be so miserable made as to lose
you, before you heare a short Examination --
Deliver'd you the Letter which I sent
Yesterday to the Damsell that you wot of?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Yes sir, shee read it, kist it a hundred times,
Then made a bosome Idoll on't,
And sayes you are the noblest Gentleman.
<P D6R>
Under a Saint that e're tooke care for sinner.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Hell take her for a mistaking whore,
Shee has the widows Letter, and the widow hers,
I found it sir, when you judiciously
Said it was Ruffian-like, and Strumpet language.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] How could you erre so strangely?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] O slightly, slightly, curse o' my heedless braine!
And then too be trapp'd with carelesnesse.
When I was so religiously resolv'd,
T'incline to vertue, and a Marriage life,
Thinking with one hand to cast off my follies,
And to take hold of vertue with the other,
For sir, (I will confesse my selfe to you)
The Letter you conveyed was in defiance,
A loose liv'd wanton, intended to a whore,
That impudently hopes an interest in me.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] It was not so directed.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I there was
(The Hell confound it on't) my giddines:
I seald both Letters e're I superscrib'd 'em,
And so gave each the contrary direction.
   [$ (^Sav.^) $] 'Twas a grosse carelesnesse, and if you lose
A fortune by't, do not blame your friends.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] That fortune should favour a whore before
An honest woman. 'Twas the sweetest Letter,
The daintiest winning things -- (the Devills in't)
Shee must not carry't from the widow so.
Fetch mee the Letter againe.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Do you thinke shee'l part with't sir?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Cannot you beat it out of her sir?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] I cannot tell how to do that.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Thus sir -- i'le give you demonstration, you
malicious Rogue, you that conspirst with her to betray me, 
so good a Master I have beene to thee, and so good a
friend to her, i'le recompence you both.
<P D6V>
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] You have undone us both, and will discard us
now you are warme in your Unkles bosome agen --
but --
   [$ (^Car.^) $] But what you Traitor you?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] You put me in good minde, and if I do not
somewhat.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I owe you somewhat for your last-nights absence,
too pernicious Villaine that kepst thy selfe out o' the
way o' purpose that I should bee drunke, and abuse
my self, and the house here all lay o' your absence, There's
somewhat more for that. [$ (^Beats him.^) $]
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] 'Tis all upon account sir.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Who knowes an honest Servingman that wants a
good Master. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] Was it your mans fault Mr. (^Carelesse^) ? if I be  #
not
reveng'd &c.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] No faith, To speak truth he was as much abus'd
in it, as you in doing a thing as contrary to his vile
conditions, as you did to your noble Name. But I crave
onely your pardon, I know not what I doe besides. This
crosse blow of chance staggers my reason so --
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] Well sir, since I have found the errour, my reason
reconciles me to you, and since it grew out of your equall
intent to cast off the evill, as to embrace the good, I will
re-mediate for you to the widow.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] But yet shee'l know I have had a whore. Yet
then you may say, 'tis such a running Disease among
young Gentlemen, that not one of a hundred has scap'd
it, that have prov'd stay'd men afterwards, and very
sober husbands; As looke you yonders one may prove,
whom now I have in good sooth a great desire to
beate.
[$ (^Enter Lady, and Bellamy talking.^) $]
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] In your Aunts presence, and your Unkles house;
Though I were not his friend; could you be so
outragious? I muse I see him here though.
<P D7R>
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Cry you mercy sir, are you his friend?
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] I make my selfe so, hee being dependent to my
noblest Lord, whom I am bound to honour.
   [$ (^Car,^) $] What Lord I pray, that I may honour him 
too.
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] The Lord (^Lovely^) .
   [$ (^Car.^) $] That loves women above wine, wine above
wealth, wealth above friend, and friends above himselfe.
There's no scandall in all that sir.
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] It goes so of him indeed, but he loves honor above
all those.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Mr. (^Saveall^) a word.
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] Your servant Madam.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] In the name of flesh, for what dos his Lordship
employ that Angle-worme to my Aunt? Hee has had
her this houre in private conference, close chamberd up
together, not so much as Matron (^Nurse^) in the roome
with 'em, 'Tis a fine sleeke thing, and almost pitty to
hunt it, but sure I must beat it, as place and time
convenient may serve.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Pray Mr. (^Saveall^) move you my Husband for
it, I would not medle in his money matters
willingly.
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] Five hundred pound for my Lord upon the
mentioned security, I will break it to sir (^Oliver^) .
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Is that the businesse after so much privacy? very
prety, my Aunts a woman too, and my Unkle may have
as forked a fortune, as any of the City, that lend out
money to hedge in Lordships.
   [$ (^La.^) $] I am his Lordships servant.
   [$ (^Bel.^) $] And I your Lordships good Madam. And yours
Mr. (^Saveall^) .
   [$ (^Sa.^) $] I am for your way Mr. (^Bellamy^) .
   [$ (^Car.^) $] And I sir, and't please you. [$ (^Exit. Sav.       #

   [$ (^La.^) $] (^George Carelesse^) , I would speak with you.
<P D7V>
   [$ (^Car.^) $] May I not wait upon your Gentleman to the 
Gate Madam?
   [$ (^La.^) $] No good (^George^) , though I commend your
curtesie, yet would I not you should neglect your owne
dignity.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Umh -- I am under Government.
   [$ (^La.^) $] The young man, if you have modesty will thinke
you mock him, if not you'l make him become arrogant,
know you not whose man he is?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] No tis apparent, this over-slighting of him
proclaimes shee loves him, whose follower Madam, and I 
know Lords followers, Knights fellows.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Not all Lords followers to all Knights (^George^) .
   [$ (^Car.^) $] To as many as their faire Ladies will give way to,
that are not faint-hearted.
   [$ (^La.^) $] I understand you not (^George^) ; something troubles
you, you are not right to day.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I am only as I am in your favour Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Come I know what perplexes you, and 'tis
therefore that I desire to talke with you; I am not angry
with you, but let mee tell you (^George^) , although not
openly I tooke notice of the pickle you came home in
last night, after your Unkle was in Bed; to whom, 
mervayling at your absence I excus'd you, as gone at my
request to visit some Ladies with whom you staid Supper,
I told him, when you were with your Roucers.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] But did you never go?
   [$ (^La.^) $] Indeed I did, and he was satisfied.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] O my sweet Lady Aunt! I was indeed amongst 'em,
and deeply merry.
   [$ (^La.^) $] And drunke as deeply!
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I will abuse your goodnesse so no more.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Say and hold (^George^) , for your own good.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] What's now become of mee, I am under
correction.
<P D8R>
   [$ (^La.^) $] I would you could have seene your selfe, and how
your disguise became you, as I was told, I do but
friendly tell you of some passages, as they were to mee related,
by those whom I have charm'd to speake no more on't.
Be secure therefore in your Unkle.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] O my deare heavenly Aunt!
   [$ (^La.^) $] First, at the doore you bounc'd like a Giant at
the Gate of an inchanted Castle, before which could be
opened offence was taken by you at your Sedan-men;
for asking money (as appeard afterwards) more then
you brought from the Taverne, and leaving their office
fouler by a distemper'd stomach-full, then you found it.
In the strife for these sad causes your Sword being seiz'd
on, you being unable to use it, were found by my servants
at (^Luggs^) with your brace of Corps bearers, in the dirt, 
and their poore hovill Chaire turnd on his ridge in the 
Kennel.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I'le never be drunk agen.
   [$ (^La.^) $] I hope you will say so, when you have heard all
(^George^) ; but by the way your late stock being spent, here
are ten peeces towards a supply.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] O sweet golden Aunt!
   [$ (^La.^) $] [^NO CHARACTER NAME GIVEN IN SOURCE TEXT.^] Well    #
sir, the striefe appeas'd, you were tane in. Then hay
is there no Sack i'the house? Tis for you in you Chamber
is replid, up you are had, where is the Rogue my man?
not seene since Yesterday; Fetch me a wench. Blesse us
cries old (^Sim^) the Butler, wee have none i'th house, nor
cannot send for any out o' dores. Dost -- tell me that? is
not my Ladies Woman, my Ladies Chamber-maide, the
Laundry-maide, the wench under the Cooke, my Ladies
Nurse old (^Winter-plum^) , nor my Lady her selfe within?
I know, or will know all the shee things in the house.
   [$ (^La.^) $] But why me up in your bedroll (^George^) ?   
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Pseigh. [$ (^Beats his head^) $]
   [$ (^La.^) $] You remember none o' this!
<P D8V>
   [$ (^Car.^) $] It is not worth it Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Nor how you scar'd Chamber-maid, whom (^I^) sent in
love to see care taken for you, not dreaming of any ill
thought in you, doe you remember how you told her, 
and what you would give her, when your Unkle died for
a small present curtesie? she was faine to satisfie [^SOURCE TEXT:   #
saisfie^] you with
a false promise to steale to bed to you before foure men 
could force, or humor you into it.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] What an unhallowed Rascal was (^I^) !
   [$ (^La.^) $] 'Tis well you consider it now. And still consider
(^George^) .
How ill excesse of Wine, Roaring and VVhoring
becomes a Gentleman, and how well sobrietie, curtesie, and
noble action, and dangers wait upon the one sort, and
what safety accompanies the other!
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Wine, Roaring and Whoring, (^I^) will lay that
saying of yours Madam to my heart; but Wine is the great
wheele that sets the rest a whirling.
   [$ (^La.^) $] True (^George^) , for had you not first beene sullied
with Wine, you would not have abus'd your selfe to ha
tumbled in the dirt with your Litter-mules, nor offer'd
to seduce my Chamber-maide. Suppose you had
overcome her, how could you have come off but with
shame to your selfe, and the utter ruine of the poore
Wench?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Still shee corrects me for my medling with base
matters and people, shee is not angry shee sayes, though
(^I^) call'd for her last night i'my drinke, shee gives me
mony, (^I^) will now understand her, and whereunto all her
former favours and her later admonitions are directed,
and presently appeare a gratefull Nephew.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Nay, bee not sad upon it (^George^) , as (^I^)      #
would win
you from your faults, (^I^) would have you still be
cheerfull. If any thought troubles you, you may be free with
me (^George^) .
<P E1R>
   [$ (^Car.^) $] O Madam you have made me, and now take me 
to you.
   [$ (^La.^) $] How meane you?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Freely and wholly, the truest, faithfullst servant,
and I thinke the ablest that any Lady of your lacks and
longings ever bestowd a favour on, though I say't my self.
You'l swear't when you have tri'd me, and't be but
hourely for a month together.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Is the man sound troe?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I defy Surgeon, or the Potecary can come against 
mee.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Sound i' your senses sir, I meane.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] O for blabbing Madam never feare mee, now I
am resolv'd to live soberly, and be onely yours. And
with such pleasure, with such safety, secresie, and
fulnesse, I will so constantly supply you, that you shall
not have time to dreame of the defects of your old
man.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Doe you meane your Unkle, and not know whose
wrong you unnaturally and sinfully pursue?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] No man living Madam can doe it for him, more
naturally and lesse sinfully; I am of the same flesh and 
blood, and bring his youth to your pleasure, how can
you thinke old Unkles children are got? or how came
up the proverbe, (^Shee is one of mine Aunts^) , doe you
thinke? You would have a child by him. All your
Cawdells and Cock-broaths will never doe it, An old
mans generative spirit runs all into braine, and that runs
after covetousnesse too, get wealth, not children. Believe
it, much Nephews helpe belongs to it, and then the
children are not degenerate, I cannot thinke but many
Unkles know it, and give way to it, because stranger
bloods shall not inherit their Lands, and so sweet Aunt
if I live not to inherit his, my son may, in your first born.
There will be a sweet comfort to you.
<P E1V>
   [$ (^La.^) $] But is all this in earnest?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] In earnest? yes, And I pray so take it, and let it
be a bargaine, and now presently in the Chamber, I will
make you my first payment for the purchace.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Fie, fie, you doe but say so?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] That shall be tri'd presently. Come sweet
Madam, I finde you are willing, and I sweare I am resolute,
and will be as secret as your own woman, if you will not
goe I protest i'le carry you.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Nay preythee (^George^) set me down a little.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Psewgh -- I need none o' these whesings I.
   [$ (^La.^) $] But prathee tell mee, dost thou not all this onely
to trie me, or am I a Rogue thinke you, or wouldst thou
seriously that thine own naturall Unkle, thy bountifull
Patron, nay thy father on the matter, should suffer such
a wrong, and done by us?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Harke there againe, Madam have I not proved
sufficiently and plainely, that I shall in doing the feate
for him doe him the greatest right in the world, in getting
him, and you an indubitable heire, and to give him both
the comfort, and the glory of it?
   [$ (^La.^) $] Was ever such a Reprobate?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] And you can doe him no wrong (though you had
not a Ladies priviledge) to Cuckold him, for assure your
selfe hee Cuckqueanes you, now come Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] You speake not on your knowledge.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I never was his Pimpe, but what I have heard, I
have heard. Now come Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] I heard Mr. (^Saveall^) protest within these three  #
days
that hee thought my Husband the chastest man (of a 
Gentleman) that he knows.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] O did hee so, Madam, believe it they two have
whor'd together, and that (^Saveall^) has pimpt for him
oftener then you ever lay with my Unkle.
   [$ (^La.^) $] What! since he married me?
<P E2R>
   [$ (^Car.^) $] What else? (^Saveall^) is not onely his grave
Parasite, but his Pimpe, and has spent my Unkle more in
these civill punctuall wayes, then I in all my whole
debauches, what did you thinke hee kept him for? O
they are a brace of subtle dry Tweakes, come now
Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] What an inhumane Villain's this!
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I'le tell you all now upon our inward
acquaintance.
   [$ (^La.^) $] You have told too much already to have any
acquaintance with me at all, nor shall you unlesse you
presently recant all that you have, or would have said upon
this subject.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Madam --
   [$ (^La.^) $] Stand further and replie not, lesse I call in those
that shall sadly silence you. Have you abus'd your Unkle,
and the next best friend you have i' the World, in hope
thereby to abuse mee most, that was no enemy of yours
till now you justly have provok'd me?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I tooke not a right course.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Was this the best construction you could make of
my love to you, or a fit requitall, to make me an
incestuous Whore?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Yes, yes, a pox my course was right enough, but
I undertooke her at an ill season. Her spruce springall
left her but now, i'le tell her so Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Come I perceive you are sorry; and that's a
part of satisfaction. Therefore for once i'le winke at
your transgression, especially before others. Here's one
you see.
[$ (^Enter Closet.^) $]
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I doe, the Devill blind her.
   [$ (^Nur.^) $] Madam --
   [$ (^La.^) $] But tempt me so againe, and i'le undoe you.
<P E2V>
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I know how you'l undoe mee witty Madam, 
(^Ah^) -- [$ (^Aside.^) $]
   [$ (^La.^) $] Nay be not sad (^George^) , discover not your       #
selfe, and
you are safe, for once I tell you.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Shee'l come about I see.
   [$ (^La.^) $] But will you Cozen goe, and doe that for me?
   [$ (^Car.^) $] Most readily good Madam, I have your full
directions.
   [$ (^La.^) $] All Cosen, if you forget not.
   [$ (^Car.^) $] I cannot be so negligent in your service Madam, 
I finde by this fain'd errand shee dares not trust her
trollop there, I love her wit now too. [$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^La.^) $] He is both schoold, and coold I hope. Now (^Closet^) 
what's your News?
   [$ (^Clo.^) $] Of a Citizen Madam that intreats to speake with
your Ladiship.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Doe you not know his Name, or Trade?
   [$ (^Clo.^) $] Yes, I had both eene now, but I have such a 
Head.
   [$ (^La.^) $] If you have lost 'em by the way pray go back and
seeke 'em, or bring you his businesse.
   [$ (^Clo.^) $] I ask'd his businesse Madam, and told him hee
might trust mee with it without a hand to his booke, but
he said it could not be delivered, but by his owne word
o' mouth to your Ladiship.
   [$ (^La.^) $] What strange matter is it troe? or what Citizen,
is not his Name (^Saleware^) ?
   [$ (^Clo.^) $] Yes Madam, and he is a (O this head) a --
   [$ (^La.^) $] A Silkeman is he not?
   [$ (^Clo.^) $] Yes Madam the same.
   [$ (^La.^) $] I hope his impudent Wife has not told him all; 
if shee has, where's his remedy in this Womans
Lawcase?
   [$ (^Clo.^) $] There's a Gentleman with him too Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Then wee shall have it, 'Tis his Wife sure, well I
<P E3R>
am prepar'd for the incounter. Bid 'em come up, if they
grow violent or too bold with mee, i'le set my Nephew
(^George^) upon 'em. 'Tis not his Wife, what Creature is it
troe with me, Mr. (^Saleware^) ?
[$ (^Enter Saleware, Phebe.^) $]
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Craving your pardon Madam, a few words in the
behalfe of this poore Kinsewoman of mine, touching
a Gentleman, who I heare lives in your House, Mr. (^George
Carelesse^) , Madam, by whom shee has received much
injury.
   [$ (^La.^) $] How sir I pray?
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Pray Madam read this Letter, weepe not, but
hold up thy head Cuz, wee will not be dasht, nor basht
in a good cause; pray read you Madam.
   [$ (^La.^) $] (^I am now (Lady) in favour with my Unkle,
and in faire possibility of a good Estate, deporting my
selfe (I intend to doe) a civill Gentleman. To which
end (induc'd as well by reason, as by long continued
affections) I tender my selfe to you in the holy
condition of Marriage. If you vouchsafe your consent,
(which is my most earnest request) I shall not onely
declare my selfe a good Husband, but the most 
happy, Geo. Carelesse.^) 
   [$ (^La.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: (^Sal.^) ^] Wherein appeares the     #
injury to your 
Kinswoman?
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] In flying from his Word, and Deed Madam. He
has borne her in hand these two yeares, and use her at his
pleasure, detaining her from her choyce of many good
fortunes, and at last sends her this to make amends for
all, and denies his act the next day, sending his man to
take the Letter from her, pretending 'twas directed to
another. But never the sooner for a hasty word Cosen,
we will not be dasht nor basht, I warrant thee.
<P E3V>
   [$ (^La.^) $] Here's the direction. (^To the Lilly White Hands
of Mistris Mariana Gymcrack^) , is that your Name
Lady?
   [$ (^Phe.^) $] I am the sorrowfull one that is knowne by it
Madam.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Never the sooner for a hasty word Cosen.
   [$ (^La.^) $] I conceive the businesse, and find the error, and my
great doubt is over.
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Weepe not I say.
   [$ (^La.^) $] What would you have me doe Mr. (^Saleware^) ?
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] You have discretion Madam, and I made choice
of your Ladiship to open this matter unto you, rather
then to Sir (^Oliver^) himselfe, whom I would not
willingly exasperate against his Nephew, you may be pleased in
a milder way to temper him, and worke a satisfaction for
my Kinsewoman; Sir (^Oliver^) and your selfe Madam, are
noble Customers to my Shop, and for your sakes I would
not deale rigourously with your Kinseman, if a gentle
end may be made. But, if you cannot so compound it,
the Law lies open, money and friends are to be found, a
good cause shall not be sterv'd, I will not be dasht nor
basht, (^ (\Sapientia mea mihi\) ^) is my word, and so good Madam
you know my mind.
   [$ (^La.^) $] 'Tis pity a Gentlewoman should suffer too much,
and I like her so well at first sight, that I am easily mov'd
to doe good for her, is shee your Kinsewoman in blood
Mr. (^Saleware^) , or your wifes?
   [$ (^Sal.^) $] Mine I assure your Ladiship, though my wife can
boast as great and noble friends I thank fortune, as the
wife of any Tradesman that carries a head in the City,
(but that's by the by) yet I came of a better house, and am
a Gentleman borne, none disprais'd.
   [$ (^La.^) $] Well Mr. (^Saleware^) , leave your Kinsewoman with
me a little while, you shall not be seene in my act, i'le try
what I can doe for her.
