   [$ (^Lord^) Keeble.$] (^You must answer Positively Sir, for you   #
have had
advice enough, yea good advice if you imbrace it, it is good advice  #
to you,
but the Court doth not expect an answer from you to what hath been
already said to you, but they expect that without any more dispute   #
you apply
your selfe to answer according to that which you are advised unto,   #
do it if
you will, and if you will but answer to it so as hath been declared  #
to you, it
shall suffice; but so farre you must go to this, as to declare       #
whether you be
the man or no before you go away; and therefore dispute it no more,  #
lest
you deprive your selfe of the benefit of the Law.^) 
   [$ (^Leut. Col. Lilburn.^) $] Well then Sir, according to your own 
explanation, I say my Name is (^John Lilburn^) sonne to M. (^Richard #
Lilburn^) , of
the County of (^Durham^) , a Free-man of the City of (^London^) , and 
sometimes Lieutenant Colonel in the Parliaments Army; and if you will
not believe that I am the man, my Guardian the Lieutenant of the
(^Tower^) there [$ (pointing to him) $] will aver that I am.
   [$Lord Keeble.$] (^So then you are the man.^) 
   [$Judge Jarmen.$] (^Ask him again, hearken M.^) Lilburn,          #
(^hearken what he
saies, and use that moderation, and temper, and discretion that you  #
have
promised^) .
   [$ (^Lieut. Col. Lilburn.^) $] One word more, and I shall have    #
done, and
that is by the law of (^England^) , [$ (but being interrupted he     #
cryed out) $]
with your favour Sir, I will come to the main thing, I hope you do
not go about to Circumvent me, therefore heare me I beseech
you.
   [$Lord Keebel.$] (^Hear the Court M.^) Lilburn, (^there shall be  #
nothing
of Circumvention or interruption, but as you have professed to be
a Rational and understanding man in words, let your deeds so declare
you^) .
   [$ (^Lieut. Col Lilburn.^) $] Sir, I beseech you do not supprise  #
me with
puntilios, or nicities, which are hard things for me to lose my life #
upon,
I tell you again, my Name is (^John Lilburn^) , son to M. (^Richard
Lilburn^) .
   [$Lord Keeble.$] (^Talk not of puntilios with us, nor talk not of #
Iudges
made by the lawes, you shall not want law; but if you talk of        #
puntilios
here in this room, we will stop that language.^) 
<P 25>
   [$ (^L. Col. Lil.^) $] Truely, Sir, I am upon my life, and shall  #
my ignorance
of the formalities of the law in the practicke part thereof destroy  #
me,
God forbid! therefore give me but leave to speak for my life, or else
knock me on the head, and murther me where I stand, which is more
righteous and just then to doe it by pretence of Justice. Sir, I know
that Mr. (^Bradshaw^) himselfe, President to the high Court of       #
Justice, as
it was called, gave Duke (^Hamilton^) (^ (a hostile enimy) ^) leave  #
to speak to the
punctillios of the law; yea, and to my knowledg again and again made
an engagement unto him and the rest tryed with him, that the Court
nor he would not by vertue of their ignorance of the niceties or
formalities of the law, take advantage against them to destroy them; #
but did
declare again and again that all advantages of formalities should be
totally laid aside, and not in the least made use of against them to #
their
prejudice, and I hope you will grant me, that have often beene in    #
Armes
for you, but never against you, as much favour and priviledge as was
granted to Duke (^Hamilton^) , never of your party, but a Generall   #
of a
numerous Army against you.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^Take it as you will, we have had patience with  #
you, and
you must and shall have patience with us; wee will passe over all    #
that is by
past, but take heed by your surly crosnesse you give not advantage   #
in the face
of the Court, to passe sentence against you, without any further     #
proceedings,
or proofe of your actions, but what our own eyes see. The ceremony   #
is for your
advantage more then you are aware of: but if you confesse your selfe #
to be
Mr.^) John Lilburn, (^we have done as to that^) .
   [$Judg Jarman.$] (^Mr. Lilburn, at the beginning you talked of    #
moderation,
and that you would cary your selfe with rationality, which methinks  #
in your
actions you fall short of, for you have said that Mr. Atturney       #
generall was
a very unequall prosecutor of you, because you say he was the        #
creator of our Commission.^) 
[^AN ASTERISK AFTER creator REFERS READER TO THE FOLLOWING NOTE IN THE 
MARGIN.^]
[$ (^Mr.^) Lilburn (^here endeavored [^SOURCE TEXT: endeavoted^] to
speak & shew the Judge his mistake,
for he did not say that Mr.^) Prideaux
(^was the creator of the commission, but
that hee was one of the creators of all
the Judges, & thereby was judge of
his Judges, & in that regard he was
no compotent accuser or prosecutor,
but they would not suffer him to speak
but cryed out^) ,$] hear the Court, [$ (^which
thing also they frequently did
afterwards^) .$]
(^Pray heare me, I
heard you; and do not you think to put
affronts upon us undisserv'd: And as
for that man that you call M.^) 
Bradshaw, (^I tell you again he is L.
President of the Councell of State
of the Common-wealth of^) England,
(^and why you should so much neglect
him, doth not so much favor of
rationality and moderation, as you
pretend your selfe to bee possessed
with^) .
<P 26>
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^Come, will you read the Indictment?^)
   [$Mr. (^Broughton^) $] [$reads.$] (^Hold up your hand^) John      #
Lilburn, (^and hearken to
your charge^) .
   (^Thou standst indicted of high Treason by the name of^) John     #
Lilburn, (^late
of London, Gentleman, for that thou as a false Traitor, not having   #
the fear 
of God before thy eyes, but being stirred up and moved by the        #
instigation of

dayes proceedings,
to which the Reader is referred^) .$]
   [$Mr. Broughton.$] (^What saist thou^) John Lilburn, (^art thou   #
guilty of this
Treason whereof thou standest indicted, or not guilty^) .
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Gentlemen, I require the favour that I    #
may be heard,
and I shall desire nothing but that which may stand with reason and
justice.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^Mr. Lilburn, We shall deale with you according  #
to reason
and justice, and after such a manner as you your selfe shall judge   #
rationall
and right.^) 
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilburn.^) $] Gentlemen, I shall speake but a few    #
words, I
beseech you hear me, for it is upon my life.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^You say you will deale rationally in those      #
wayes; that is to
be expected from you the first in reason, is to answer, and plead,   #
and before
you so doe, you cannot be heard.^) 
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilburn.^) $] Give me leave to speak, and I shall    #
not speak 6 lines
[$ (which [^A SPACE IN SOURCE TEXT INSTEAD OF THE FINAL "h"^] with   #
much strugling being granted, Mr. (^Lilburn^) went on and
said to this effect.) $]
   Then Sir, thus, By the laws of (^England^) I am not to answer to
questions against, or concerning my selfe.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^You shall not be compeld.^) 
   [$Another Judg.$] (^Mr.^) Lilburn, (^is this to answer against    #
your selfe, to say
you are not guilty, by the lawes of the Land you are to plead to     #
your charge,
and it is no accusing of your selfe to say guilty, or not guilty^) .
   [$ (^L. Coll. Lilb.^) $] Sir, by your favour. -- 
   [$Judg Keble.$] (^To answer that you are not guilty, is no great  #
matter, nor
definit in law.^) 
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] By the law of (^England^) I am to be      #
tryed by a Rule,
but I do not know by the rules of the law, what benefit, in          #
reference to
my exception against the illegality of my Indictment, I may deprive my
selfe of, in case I should answer before I except.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^The law is plain, that you are positively to    #
answer, guilty or
not guilty, which you please.^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Sir, By the Petition of Right, I am not   #
to answer to
<P 27>
any Questions concerning my selfe; therefore I humbly entreat you to
afford me the priviledges of the laws of (^England^) , and I will    #
return a
positive answer to it, if you will but please to allow me Counsell,  #
that I
may consult with them, for I am ignorant of the formalities of law in
the practick part of it, although I here declare I own the good old  #
laws
of (^England^) , and a legall Jury of 12. men, yea, and a tryall by  #
a jury of
legall men: and I doe humbly crave (Sir) a copy of the Indictment, or
so much of it as I may ground my plea upon it, and reasonable time to
consult with my Councell, although it be but 8. or 9. days.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^You speak well, but you must doe well, 'tis     #
that we come for,
the rationablenesse of it is this, that you should shortly answer    #
(Sir) to that
question, and in a rationall legall way: when you have answered it,  #
you shal
have liberty to make your defence, to maintain that you say; but     #
this that
we speak now of, is a thing in your own breast, in your own knowledge,
whether you be guilty of this that is laid to your charge, or no:    #
And if you be
clear, you cannot wrong your selfe, nor your conscience; for in saying
not guilty, you know better what you say then any other doth.^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Sir, I am ignorant of the formalities of  #
the Law,
having no bookes in English wherein I can read them: and as for other
tongues I understand none, and therefore for you to take away my life
for my ignorance, when the practick part of the Law, or the
formalities thereof is lockt up in strange language, that it is      #
impossible for mee
to read or understand, is extream hard.
   It is true, in those English plaine laws which I have read, I find
something spoken of it; but must aver that I find there is a great   #
deale of
nicity and danger in locking a man up to single formalities, in 
answering guilty, or not guilty, and therefore I beseech to assign   #
me Councel,
to informe my ignorance, and give mee but leave to consult with my
Councell, and I will returne you an answer according to your desire,
without any demurre, as soone as it is possible for mee to know what
grounds [^SOURCE TEXT: gro nds^] I goe upon.
   [$ (^Mr. Broughton.^) $] John Lilburn, (^what saist thou, art     #
thou guiltie of the
Treason laid unto thy charge, or art thou not guiltie^) .
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] But under favour thus, for you to come to #
ensnare and
entrap me with unknown nicities and formalities, that are lockt up in
the French and Latine tongue, and cannot be read in English bookes,
they being not exprest in any law of the Kingdome, published in our
owne English tongue: it is not faire play according to the law of
(^England^) , plainly in English exprest in the Petition of Right,   #
and other the
good olde statute-Lawes of the Land: Therefore I again humbly desire
<P 28>
to have Councell assigned to me to consult with what these formalities
in law signifie, so that I may not throw away my life ignorantly upon
formes.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^Mr. Lilburn, we cannot grant you that favour,   #
it is not
consistent to the law, whatsoever you say to the contrary?^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] I hope you will not goe about to ensnare  #
me, and take
away my life for punctillios.
   [$Another Judg.$] (^Well then, you will not plead?^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Yes, if I may be allowed that which I     #
conceive to be
my birth right and priviledge, to consult with counsell, or that you
please to make the same engagement to me that Mr. (^Bradshaw^) , as  #
the
President of the high Court of justice made to Duke (^Hamilton^) ,   #
which was,
that the Court would take no advantage at all at his ignorance in the
nicities and formalities of the law in his pleading; let me but      #
enjoy this
engagement from you, and I will plead.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^You shall have that which is according to the   #
law, therefore
Mr.^) Lilburn (^I advise you for to plead [^SOURCE TEXT: plad^] ,    #
and you shall have faire play, and no
advantage taken against you by your ignorance of the formalitie of   #
the law^) ?
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Well then, Sir, upon that engagement, and #
because, I see
you are so positive in the thing -- This is my answer, that I am not 
guilty of any of the Treasons in manner and form, as they are there  #
laid
down in that indictment, [$pointing to it,$] and therefore now Sir,  #
having
pleaded, I crave the liberty of (^England^) , that you will assigne me
counsell.
   [$Mr. Broughton.$] (^By whom wilt thou be tried?^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] By the known lawes of (^England^) , and a #
legall jury of my
equals, constituted according to law.
   [$Mr. Brought.$] (^By whom wilt thou be tried?^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] By the known laws of (^England^) , I      #
meane by the
liberties and priviledges of the laws of (^England^) , and a jury    #
of my equalls
legally chosen: and now Sir, I again desire Counsell to be assigned me
to consult with, in point of law, that so I may not destroy my selfe
through my ignorance; this is but the same priviledg that was granted
at (^Oxford^) unto me and the rest of my fellow prisoners arraigned  #
with 
mee.
   [$One of the Clerks.$] (^You must say by God and your countrey,   #
that's the
forme of the law?^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Why must I say so?
   [$Another Judg.$] (^This is the form and law of the Land, will    #
you plead Mr.^) 
Lilburn, (^according to the lawes of England^) ?
<P 29>
   [$ (^L. C. Lilb.^) $] Truly I never read it Sir, in the lawes of  #
(^England^) , what it
is to plead in this nature.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^You say you will be tried by the lawes of the   #
Land, then it is
by the Countrey, and so you may plead and doe your selfe no harme;   #
for by
the Countrey is meant a Jurie of your equalls?^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Sir, I am doubtfull of my ignorance in    #
the Lawes, yet 
I will returne you an answer, you making good your already engaged
promises, that you will take no advantage against me, if through
my ignorance, and your importunitie, I plead in any forme, that in
strictnesse of acceptation may deprive me of any reall benefit the   #
law will
afford me.
   [$Judg Thorp.$] (^Mr.^) Lilburn, (^you will be tried by the law,  #
and by the rules
thereof, when you say so, you doe reallie declare it to be by your   #
countrie, so
that the true signification of being tried by the law, is the same   #
thing in
substance with being tried by the rules of the law^) .
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Then I hope my answer is cleare and fair, #
Sir.
   [$Judg Jermin.$] (^The formalitie is shortly this, to be tried by #
God and your
countrie, no more is meant by it but thus, by God, as God is everie  #
where
present, yea, in all Courts of Justice, and sits and knows all       #
things that are
acted, said, and done; the other part of it by your countrie, that   #
is, by your
countrie or neighbourhood; the Countrie is called Patria, because your
neighbour and your equals which you are willing to put your self     #
upon the triall of;
by force of that word, the Countrie, a Jurie of the neighborhood for #
triall
of you are summoned, now doe what you will.^) 
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Sir, under your favour thus, then in the  #
negative, I say
God is not locally or corporally here present to try me, or passe upon
me; but affirmative I returne this answer, that I desire to be tryed #
in
the presence of that God, that by his omnipotent power is present
every where, and beholds all the actions that are done upon the      #
earth, and
sees and knows whether any of your hearts be possessed with a 
premeditated malice against me, and whether any of you come with so  #
much
forethought of malice against me, as that in your hearts you intend to
do the utmost you can, right or wrong to destroy me, and before this
alseeing God I desire to be tryed, and by my Countrey, that is to    #
say, by
a jury of my equalls, according to the good old lawes of the Land.
   [$Justice Thorp.$] (^You have spoken very well.^) 
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^You have done like an English-man so far as you #
have gone,
and I doe assure that in any formalilites (as you expresse, or call  #
them) there
shall be no advantage against you, if you mistake in them. Now what  #
you
have the next to thinke upon, is your Jurie of your countri-men, or
<P 30>
neighbours of your equalls, and I promise you we will take care of   #
that, that they
shall be good and lawfull men of England?^)
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] I thank you Sir, but under your favour    #
thus, your
indictment is extream long, and of aboundance of particulars, it is
impossible that my memory, or of any one mans in (^England^) , can 
contain it, or carry it in our heads, and therefore that I may make my
defence so as becomes a rationall English man: I earnestly entreat you
that now you wil be pleased to give me a copy of my indictment, or so
much of it, as you expect a plea from me upon, or an answer unto, and
Counsell assigned me, and time to debate with my Counsell, and
subpoena's for witnesses.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^For councell you need none, Mr.^) Lilburn,      #
(^for that not guilty
which you have pleaded, is that which lies in your own breast, which #
rests in
your owne counsell, and you know how it is, and can best plead that  #
your self,
Councell lies in matter of law, not of fact^) .
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Vnder favour I desire Councell, for       #
matter of law, and
not for matter of fact: My indictment I believe in law, is all       #
matter of
law, and I have something to say to it in law.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^If matter of law doe arise upon the proofe of   #
the fact, you
shall know it, and then shall have Councell assigned to you.^) 
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] I my selfe have before this been upon     #
some trialls, and
never before this was denyed Councell, no nor so much as ever
disputed whether I should have it or no. I also was at a great part  #
of the 
Earl of Straffords tryall, who was supposed a most notorious Traytor, 
and yet if my observation and memory doe not exceedingly faile mee,
he had Councell assigned him at his first desire, and they were
continually with him, not only at the Bar when he was there, but     #
also had
continuall and free accesse to him in prison.
   Besides Sir, I being accused of Treason in such an extraordinary 
manner, and being but an ordinary man my selfe; no eminent experienced
Lawyer, dare well meddle with my businesse, no nor so much as bestow
a visit upon me; but he runs a hazard of being undone: and truly my
estate is in an extraordinary manner taken from me, so that I have not
money to send messengers up and downe privately to their chambers,
and therefore that I may be freely and allowedly able, without danger
of ruine to any man that shall advise me, I shall humbly crave as my
right by law, and I am sure by common equity and justice, that I may
have Councell and Soliciters also assigned me.
   [$Lord Keble.$] (^Mr.^) Lilburn, (^speake rationally for your     #
selfe, when there
comes a matter of law, that you are able to say, this is for matter  #
of law,

arising from matter of fact, that hath been proved or endeavoured to #
be
proved, when you come beyond that, you shall have it as willingly as #
you
can desire, and withall, this that you say concerning your Memory,
which you say is not able to carry away, or containe the particulars #
of this
Inditement. The Inditement so much as will charge your memory will be
very short, for it is the publishing of those books charged upon you #
in the
Inditement, that will be the matter which will stick, and that matter
will be very short, which we must prove against you, which is only
matter of fact, and not of Law, And therefore for fact of Treason    #
you can be
allowed no Counsell, but must plead it your selfe.^) 
   [$ (^L. Col. Lilb.^) $] Sir, under favour, you expect from me 
impossibilities, for seeing I have been seven moneths in prison for  #
nothing, and
could not in the least know perfectly what would be laid to my charge,
nor after what manner I should be proceeded against (considering
all proceedings against me hithertoward) have been so absolutely
arbitrary, that it was impossible for me in Law exactly to come
provided) and therefore seeing I am now here, and you pretend to     #
proceed
with me according to the due course of Law, and seeing the forme of 
the proceedings in this manner with me is not expresly and
exactly declared in print in (^English^) , which tongue only I can   #
read and
understand, and seeing by the Law which is in (^English^) , which I  #
have
read, and clearly understand, that there are a great many snares, and
a great many niceties in the practick, that are formall proceedings
of the Law, and seeing I know not certainly, whether if I proceed
to matter of proofe, before in Law I make my exceptions against your
Inditement, as to matter, time, and place, I be not in Law deprived
of that benefit, which I principally aime at for the preservation of
my life, therefore I beseech and most earnestly entreat you, to      #
assigne
me Counsell to consult with, before I be too farre insnared, and if  #
you
will not doe it, and give me some reasonable time to prepare my plea
and defence, then order me to be knock'd in the head immediately in
the place where I stand without any further tryall, for I must needs
be destroyed if you deny me all the meanes of my preservation.

   [$L. Keble.$] (^Mr.^) Lilburn, (^you say you well understand your #
self: you knew
of your comming, and you knew of the fact that you have committed^) .
   [$ (^Leiut. Col. Lilburne.^) $] Truely Sir, six moneths a goe I   #
heard much of my
Tryall, and I longed for it, but could not have it, but was stil     #
kept in prison,
and abundance of provocations put upon me, to make me cry out of my
oppressions and then to hang me, therefore by a Law made after my
pretended crime was committed is not just; and truly Sir, I heard by
uncertaine common fame of my Tryall now. But Parliament men told my
wife and friends, that my chiefest crime was corresponding with the
Prince; and to defend my self against that, I fitted my self, never  #
dreaming
that onely books should be laid to my charge; and therefore I could  #
not,
as to that come prepared; and therefore do humbly desire Councell, a
Copy of my Indictment, and time to bring in my Witnesses.
   [$L. Keeble.$] (^Heare what is said to you, for your Witnesses,   #

   [$ (^Leiut. Col. Lilburne.^) $] Sir, some of my witnesses lives,  #

miles off, and yet I must bring them to morrow morning, how's that 
possible; and therefore I desire time to bring them in, and also     #
Subpeanas, for
some of them are Parliament men, and some of them Officers of the
Army, and they will not come in without compulsion.
   [$L Keeble.$] (^That's the time, we will give you no longer, you  #

owne apprehension, to have so much hard measure and injustice as
I have, to know whether or no you will permit me, after that I
have pleaded to a matter of Fact, according to the Law of 
ENGLAND [^SOURCE TEXT: E N G L A N D^] , that has beene allowed to   #
the highest Traytors in all the
Bookes that I have read of, that I may speake in my owne behalfe     #

the Jury, my Countrymen, upon whose consciences, integrity, and
honesty, my life, and the Lives and Liberties of the honest men of
this Nation now lyes, who are in Law Judges of Law as well as Fact,
and you onely the pronouncers of their Sentence, Will, and Minde,
I say, I desire to know when I have pleaded to matter of Fact, 
whether you will be pleased to give me leave to speake to them a few
words besides.

<S SAMPLE 6>
<P 141>
   [$Mr. Atturney.$] (^Gentlemen of the^) Jury, (^You have heard the #
Evidence,
in behalf of the State; You have heard the insinuations of the       #
prisoner upon
them, as calling you his Fellow-Citizens, and the like: He hath      #
said, and
spoken; we have proved, and it is in your consciences to believe     #
proof, before
saying: the prisoner begun to cite you two Acts of Parliament: the   #
one in the
1. of Edw. 6. and the other the 5 and 6 of Edw. 6. and by those two  #
Acts he
would signifie to you, that you should have two plain and evident    #
Witnesses to
every particular fact; yet he did forget to cite another Statute,    #
made in the
first and second year of Philip and Mary, that overthrows and        #
annihilates
those two Statutes that would have two plain witnesses to every fact #
of
treason, and in all cases of treason will have them freed, according #
to the common
course of law the common-law for the tryall of them: if that must be
materiall, or if that stick with you, that you cannot determine it,  #
my Lords the Judges
will direct you in it, and in all other points of law: But certainly #
that
exception was a little vain too; for we did not insist with one      #
particular witnesse
in nothing at all: For that of Newcome, the prisoner did not repeat  #
fully what
he said: for I remember he said this, that Mr. Lilburn, and Capt.    #
Iones, came
together, and brought the Copy of the last sheet that was to be      #
printed: if one
come with him, and the other delivered [^SOURCE TEXT: del vered^] it #
to the Printer, they are both 
equally guiltie alike: they came again the same day at night, and    #
when the first
sheet was printed, to be sure, it was true and right, that Mr.       #
Lilburn did take
the pains to take one of the Copies into his hand, and corrected     #
it^) .
   [$ (^Lieu. Col. Lilb.^) $] By your favour Sir, he urg'd no such   #
thing; by your
favour sir, they are the express words of the testimony, to the quite 
contrary; and I wonder Mr. (^Prideaux^) you are not ashamed, to aver #
such
<P 142>
notorious falshoods, as you do, in the open face of the Court, before
thousands of Witnesses; for (^Newcome^) said no such thing, as you   #
falsly [^SOURCE TEXT: fasly^]
affirm; neither is there any such Statute in Queen (^Mary's^) time   #
that doth
abolish those two Statutes of (^Edw. 6.^) that I insist upon for two 
Witnesses; name your Statute if you can, here's the Statute book,    #
let the Jury
hear it read, and do not abuse them with your impudent falshoods.
   [$Mr. Atturney.$] (^Well Sir, I leave it to the judgment of the   #
Jury Sir: My
Lord, as for all the rest, and particularly for that of the^)        #
(\salva libertate\) , (^it is
true, there is but one witnesse which is sufficient enough by the
fore-mentioned Act of Queen^) Mary; (^but my Lord, it is under Mr.^) #
Lilburns (^own hand,
he will not deny it^) .
   [$ (^Lieu. Col. Lilb.^) $] By your favour, there is no man so     #
swears, in the least,
that it is my hand, Jesus Christ denyed none of his accusation; yet  #
when
they went about to ensnare him by questions, he answered             #
(^Pilate^) , &c.
(^Thou sayst so, go to those that heard me, they know what I said,   #
why ask you
me?^) Sir, I beseech you, produce your Act of Parliament in Queen    #
(^Maries^)
time, to prove, in cases of Treason, there ought to be but a single
Witness.
   [$Mr. Atturney.$] (^Do not interrupt me^) Mr. Lilburn.
   [$ (^L. C. Lilburn.^) $] I pray you then do not urge that which   #
is not right nor
true, but notoriously false; for if you persevere in't, I will       #
interrupt you,
and tell you of it to the purpose.
   [$ (^Just. Jermin.^) $] Though you do recite many things; yet I   #
must tel you,
the Law of the Land saith, the Councel for the Common-Wealth must
be heard.
   [$ (^L. C. Lilburn.^) $] I beseech you then, let there be no more #
added to the
testimony, then right and truth; for my life lyes upon it, and I     #
must and
will declare the business, and the falsness of it.
   [$Mr. Atturney.$] (^I would not do the tenth part of the hair of  #
your head
wrong; but being intrusted, I shall do my duty, and discharge my     #
conscience in
my place, which is fully and plainly to open that unto them, which   #
in my
conscience I think is right and just.^) 
   [$ (^L. C. Lilburn.^) $] I do repeat it thus, as in my            #
conscience, that he did say,
when the Copy was first brought, Capt. (^Jones^) gave him the Copy,  #
and
Cap. (^Jones^) did agree with him for the printing of it, and Cap.   #
(^Jones^) did
read the Original to his Corrector; which Corrector                  #
[^SOURCE TEXT: Correctar^] amended the 
Printers faults, and that I had an uncorrected sheet away, and that  #
his forms
were taken before he had perfected that.
   [$Mr. Atturney.$] (^And^) Mr. Lilburn (^came the second time^) .
<P 143>
   [$ (^L. C. Lilburn.^) $] Will you spend all day in vain           #
repetitions? you would
not give one leave to breath, nor freely to speak truth, without
interruption, although you were laying load upon me for 5 hours      #
together: I
pray sir, do not now go about to tire the Jury with tedious          #
repetitions,
nor to sophisticate or adulterate their understandings with your
falshoods and untruths.
   [$ (^Just. Jerm.^) $] Mr. (^Lilburn^) , the law of the land is,   #
that the Councel for
the State must speak last.
   [$ (^L. C. Lilburn.^) $] Sir, your law is according to the law of #
God, you
said, and that law I am sure, it will have [^SOURCE TEXT: havo^] no  #
man to bear false witness;
why doth Mr. (^Prideaux^) tell the Jury such falshoods, as he doth,  #
and takes
up six times more time to take away my life, then you or he will allow
me to defend it.
