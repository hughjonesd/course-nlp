[^BETSY AND GAYLAND.^]
[^---^] "What,
my dear," [$said he, taking her in a free
manner by the hand,$] "have you been so
closely watched by your guardian and
guardianesses here, that no kind
moment offered for you to answer the
devoirs of your humble servant?" "The
surest guardians of my fame and peace,"
[$replied she, snatching her hand away,$] "is
the little share of understanding I am
mistress of, which, I hope, will always
be sufficient to defend my honour in
more dangerous attacks, than the rude
impertinencies of an idle coxcomb."

   [$These words, and the air with which
they were spoke, one would think, should
have struck with confusion the person to
whom they were directed; but Gayland
was not so easily put out of countenance,
and looking her full in the face,$] -- "Ah,
Child!" [$cried he,$] "sure you are not
in your right senses to-day: -- 
understanding, -- impertinencies, -- idle
coxcomb, -- very pleasant i'faith! but upon
<P 34>
my soul, if you think these airs become
you, you are the most mistaken woman
in the world." "It may be so," [$cried
she, ready to burst with inward spite at
his insolence,$] "but I should be yet more
mistaken, if I were capable of thinking
a wretch, like you, worthy of any thing
but contempt." [$With these words she
flung out of the room, and he pursued
her with a horse-laugh, till she was out of
hearing, and then went into the
dining-room, where he found lady Mellasin, and
several who had come to visit her.$]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 48>
[^MR. GOODMAN AND THE ALDERMAN.^]
   [$After having ended what they had to
say to each other upon business,$] "Mr.
Goodman," [$said the alderman,$] "we
have long been friends, I always thought
you an honest, fair-dealing man, and
am, therefore, very much surprized you
should go about to put upon me in the
manner you have lately done." "Put
upon you, sir," [$cried the merchant,$] "I
know not what you mean, and am very
certain I never did any thing that
might call in question my integrity,
either to you or any one else." "It
was great integrity indeed," [$resumed
the alderman, with a sneer,$] "to
endeavour to draw my only son into a
clandestine marriage, with the girl you
have at your house." [$Mr. Goodman
was astonished, as well he might, at this
accusation, and perceiving by some other
words that the alderman let fall, that he
was well acquainted with the love young
Saving had professed for miss Betsy, frankly
related to him all that he knew of the
courtship, and the method he had taken
to put a stop to it.$] "That was not
<P 49>
enough, sir," [$cried the alderman hastily,$]
"you should have told me of it. -- Do
you think young folks, like them,
would have regarded your forbidding?
-- No, no; I'll warrant you they would
have found some way or other to come
together before now, and the boy might
have been ruined, if I had not been
informed by other hands how things were
carried on, and put it out of the power
of any of you to impose upon me.
The girl may spread her nets to catch
some other woodcock, if she can, -- 
thanks to heaven, and my own
prudence, my son is far enough out of her
reach."
<P 50>
[^GOODMAN AND THE ALDERMAN CONTINUE.^]
   "You take a great deal of pains to set
her off," [$said the alderman,$] "and since
you married a court-lady not worth a
groat, have got all the romantic idle
notions of the other end of town,
as finely as if you had been bred there.
A good family! -- very pleasant i'faith.
Will a good family go to market? -- 
Will it buy a joint of mutton at the
butcher's? -- Or a pretty gown at the
mercer's? Then, a pretty fortune you
say; -- enough it may be to squander
away at cards and masquerades, for a
month or two. She has suitable
accomplishments too; -- yes, indeed, they
are suitable ones, I believe: -- I
suppose she can sing, dance, and jabber a
little French; but I'll be hanged if she
knows how to make a pye, or a
pudding, or to teach her maid to do it."
<P 51>
[^GOODMAN AND THE ALDERMAN CONTINUE.^]
[^...^] I
sent," [$said he,$] "the night before he
was to go, his portmanteau, and what
other luggage I thought he would have
occasion for, to the inn where the
Harwich stage puts up, and making him
be called up very early in the morning,
told him, he must go a little way out
of town with me, upon extraordinary
business: -- he seemed very unwilling,
said he had appointed that morning to
meet a gentleman, and begged I would
delay the journey to the next day, or
<P 52>
even till the afternoon. What caused
this backwardness, I cannot imagine,
for I think it was impossible he could
know my designs on this score; but,
whatever was in his head, I took care
to disappoint it: -- I listened to none of
his excuses, nor trusted him out of my
sight, but forced him to go with me to
the coach, in which I had secured a
couple of places. He was horridly
shocked when he found where he was
going, and would fain have perswaded
me to repeal his banishment, as he
called it: -- I laughed in my sleeve, but
took no notice of the real motive I had
for sending him away, and told him,
there was an absolute necessity for his
departure; -- that I had a business of
the greatest importance at Rotterdam,
in which I could trust nobody but
himself to negotiate, and that he would
find, in his trunk, letters and other
papers, which would instruct him how
to act.

   "In fine," [$continued the alderman,$] "I
went with him aboard, staid with
him till they were ready to weigh
anchor, then returned, and stood on
the beach till the ship sailed quite
out of sight, so that if my gentleman
had a thought of writing to his mistress,
<P 53>
he had not the least opportunity for it."
[^GOODMAN AND THE ALDERMAN AGREE TO STOP COMMUNICATION BETWEEN
BETSY AND SAVING.^]
[^---^] "by which means," [$said he,$] "all
communication between the young
people will soon be put an end to; he
will grow weary of writing when he
receives no answers, and she of thinking
of him as a lover, when she finds he
ceases to tell her he is so."
<P 54>
[^GOODMAN AND BETSY.^]
[^---^] "and," [$added he,$] "the old 
man is so incensed against him, for
having a thought of that kind in your
favour, that he has sent him beyond
sea, -- I know not to what part; --
but it seems he is never to come back,
till he has given full assurances the
liking he has for you is utterly worn off."

   "He might have spared himself the
pains," [$said miss Betsy, blushing with
disdain,$] "his son could have informed
him, how little I was inclinable to listen
to any thing he said on the score of
love; and I myself, if he had asked me
the question, would have given him the
strongest assurances that words could
form, that if ever I changed my
condition, which heaven knows I am far
from thinking on as yet, I should
<P 55>
never be prevailed upon to do it, by
any merits his son was possessed of."

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 59>
[^LADY TRUSTY TO MISS BETSY ON THE PLEASURES OF LONDON.^] 
[^---^]
"but then" [$said she,$] "the too frequent
repetition of them, may so much
engross the mind, as to take it off from
other objects, which ought to have their
share in it: besides," [$continued she,$]
"there are but too frequent proofs, that
<P 60>
an innate principle of virtue is not
always a sufficient guard against the many
snares laid for it, under the shew of
innocent pleasures, by wicked and 
designing persons of both sexes; nor can it
be esteemed prudence to run ones self
into dangers meerly to shew our strength
in overcoming them; nor, perhaps,
would even the victory turn always to
our glory: the world is censorious,
and seldom ready to put the best
construction on things; so that reputation
may suffer, though virtue triumphs."
<P 61>
[^LADY TRUSTY TALKS TO MISS BETSY OF MISS FLORA.^]
[^---^] and, therefore, [$pursued she,$] I 
should be glad, methinks, to see you
separated from that young lady, though it were
but for a small time; [$and then gave her to
understand, how great a pleasure it would 
be to her, to get her down with her to
L--e, if it could be any way
contrived, that she could go without miss
Flora.$]

   "As I have been so long from home,"
[$said she,$] "I know I shall have all the
gentry round the country to welcome
me at my return, and if you should find
the company less polite, than those you
leave behind, it will, at least, diversify
the scene, and render the entertainments
of London new to you a second time,
when you come back."

   [$Miss Betsy found in herself a strong
inclination to comply with this proposal, and
told lady Trusty, she should think herself
happy in passing the whole summer with
her; and as to miss Flora, the same offer
might be made to her, without any danger
of her accepting it.$] "I am not of your
opinion," [$said the other;$] "the girl has
no fortune, but what mr. Goodman shall
be pleased to give her; which cannot
be very considerable, as he has a nephew
in the East-Indies, whom he is extremely
<P 62>
fond of, and will make his heir. Lady
Mellasin would, therefore, catch at the
opportunity of sending her daughter to
a place where there are so many
gentlemen of estates, among whom she might
have a better chance for getting a
husband, than she can have in London,
where her character would scarce entitle
her to such a hope. I will however,"
[$pursued she,$] "run the risque, and choose
rather to have a guest, whose company
I do not so well approve of, than be
deprived of one I so much value."
<P 64>
[^FLORA, BETSY AND LADY MELLASIN HAVE BOUGHT SILKS.^]
   [$The young ladies fell to reviewing their
silks; but miss Betsy was no way satisfied
with her's: the more she looked upon it,
the worse it appeared to her.$] "I shall
never wear this with any pleasure,"
[$said she;$] "I wish the man had it in his
<P 65>
shop again, for I think it quite ugly."
[$Miss Flora told her, that she wondered at
her, that the thing was perfectly handsome,
and that my lady's judgment was never
before called in question.$] "That may be,"
[$replied miss Betsy,$] "but certainly every
one ought to please their own fancy in
the choice of their cloaths; for my part
I shall never endure to see myself in it."
"Not when their fancy happens to differ
from that of those who know better than
themselves what is fit for them," [$cried
miss Flora;$] "and, besides, have the power
over them." [$She spoke this with so much
pertness, that miss Betsy, who had a violent
spirit, was highly provoked.$] "Power over
them!" [$cried she,$] "I do not know what
you mean, miss Flora; mr. Goodman is
one of my guardians indeed, but I don't
know why that should entitle his lady to
direct me in what I shall wear."

   [$Mr. Goodman, who happened to be
looking over some papers in a little closet
he had within his parlour, hearing part of
this dispute, and finding it was like to
grow pretty warm, came out, in hopes of
moderating it. On hearing miss Betsy's
complaint, he desired to see the silk; which
being shewn him,$] "I do not pretend,"
[$said he,$] "to much understanding in these
things; but, methinks, it is very
<P 66>
handsome." It would do well enough for
winter, sir," [$replied miss Betsy;$] "but
it is too hot and heavy for summer;
besides, it is so thick and clumsy, it
would make me look as big again as I
am: I'll not wear it, I am resolved, in
the country, whatever I do when I come
to town, in the dark weather.

   "Well," [$said mr. Goodman,$] "I will
speak to my lady to get it changed
for something else." "Indeed, sir,"
[$cried miss Flora,$] "I am sure my mamma
will do no such thing, and take it very
ill to hear it proposed." "You need
not put yourself in any heat," [$replied
miss Betsy,$] "I don't desire she should be
troubled any farther about it; but, sir,"
[$continued she, turning to mr. Goodman,$]
"I think I am now at an age capable of
choosing for myself, in the article of
dress; and as it has been settled between
you and sir Ralph Trusty, that out of
the income of my fortune, thirty pounds
a year should be allowed for my board,
twenty pounds for my pocket expences,
and fifty for my cloaths, I think I ought
to have the two latter entirely at my own
disposal, and to lay it out as I think
fit, and not be obliged, like a
charity-child, to wear whatever livery my
benefactor shall be pleased to order." [$She
<P 67>
spoke this with so much spleen, that mr.
Goodman was a little nettled at it, and
told her, that what his wife had done was
out of kindness and good-will, which since
she did not take as was meant, she should
have her money to do with as she would.$]

   "That is all I desire," [$answered she,$]
"therefore be pleased to let me have twenty
guineas now, or, if there does not
remain so much in your hands, I will
ask sir Ralph to advance it, and you
may return it to him when you
settle accounts." "No, no," [$cried
the merchant hastily,$] "I see no reason to
trouble my good friend, sir Ralph, on
such a frivolous matter. You shall
have the sum you mention, miss Betsy,
whether so much remains out of the
hundred pounds a year set apart for
your subsistance, or not, as I can but
deduct it out of the next payment; but
I would have you manage with
discretion, for you may depend, that the
surplus of what was at first agreed upon,
shall not be broke into, but laid up to
increase your fortune, which, by the
time you come of age, I hope, will be
pretty handsomely improved.

   [$Miss Betsy then assured him, that she
doubted not of his zeal for her interest,
<P 68>
and hoped she had not offended him in
any thing she had said.$] "No, no,"
[$replied he,$] "I always make allowances for
the little impatiencies of persons of
your sex and age, especially when dress
is concerned." [^...^]
<P 71>
[^BETSY HAS DISCOVERED THAT GAYLAND HAS VISITED FLORA.^]
   [$She was, however, beginning to
meditate on this point, when she heard miss
Flora come up stairs, calling at every step,$]
"miss Betsy! -- miss Betsy! -- where are
you?" [$Gayland was gone, and his
young mistress being told miss Betsy was
come home, guessed it was she who had
given an interruption to their pleasures,
by coming to the door; she, therefore, as
she could not imagine her so perfectly
convinced, contrived to disguise the whole,
and worst of the truth, by revealing a part
of it; and as soon as she had found her,$]
"Lord, miss Betsy!" [$cried she, with an
unparalell'd assurance,$] "where have you
been? -- how do you think I have been
served by that cursed toad Gayland?
he came up into our chamber, where
the mantua-maker and I were, and as
soon as she was gone, locked the door,
and began to kiss and touze me so, that
I protest I was frighted almost out of
my wits. The devil meant no harm
though, I believe, for I got rid of him
easy enough; but I wish you had rapped
heartily at the door, and obliged him
to open it, that we both might have
rated him for his impudence." "Some
people have a great deal of impudence,
<P 72>
indeed," [$replied miss Betsy, astonished
at her manner of bearing it off.$] "Aye,
so they have, my dear," [$rejoined the
other, with a careless air;$] "but, prithee,
where have you been rambling by your
self?" "No farther than
Bedford-street," [$answered miss Betsy:$] "you may
see on what errand," [$continued she,
pointing to the silks,$] [^---^]

<S SAMPLE 4>
<P 85>
[^BETSY AND FLORA HAVE MET TWO YOUNG GENTLEMEN IN OXFORD.^]
[^...^] "Heaven!" [$cried he,$]
"how divinely lovely do you now appear?
the goddess of the spring, nor Venus's
self, was ever painted half so beautiful.
<P 86>
What eyes! -- what a mouth! -- and
what a shape!" [$continued he, 
surveying her, as it were, from head to foot,$]
"how exquisitely turned! -- how taper! --
how slender! -- I don't believe you
measure half a yard round the waist."
[$In speaking these words, he put his
handkerchief about her waist, after which he
tied it round his head, repeating these lines
of mr. Waller's:$]
[^VERSE OMITTED.^]
   "O fie upon it," [$said miss Betsy,
laughing, and snatching it from his head,$]
"this poetry is stale, I should rather have
expected from an Oxonian, some fine
thing of his own extempore, on this
occasion; which, perhaps, I might have
been vain enough to have got printed
in the monthly magazines."

   "Ah! madam," [$replied he, looking
on her with dying languishments,$] "where
the heart is deeply affected, the brain
seldom produces any thing but
incongruous ideas. Had Sacarissa been
<P 87>
mistress of the charms you are, or had
Waller loved like me, he had been less
capable of writing in the manner he
did.
<P 88>
[^FLORA AND THE OTHER GENTLEMAN ARE GONE: BETSY THINKS 
HER GENTLEMAN IS TAKING GREAT LIBERTIES.^]
[^---^] "Bless me," [$cried 
she,$] "what is the meaning of all this? --
where are our friends?" "They are
gone," [$said he,$] "to pay the debt,
which love, and youth, and beauty
challenge; let us not be remiss, nor waste
the precious moments in idle scruples.
Come, my angel!" [$pursed he,
endeavouring to get her once more into his
arms,$] "make me the happiest of mankind,
and be as divinely good as you are fair."

   "I do not understand you, sir,"
[$replied she,$] "but neither desire, nor will stay
to hear an explanation." [$She spoke this
with somewhat of an haughty air, and was
making towards the door; but he was far
from being intimidated, and, instead of
suffering her to pass, he seized her a little
roughly with one hand, and with the other
made fast the door;$] "Come, come, my
dear creature," [$cried he,$] "no more
resistance, you see you are in my power,
and the very name of being so, is
sufficent to absolve you to yourself, for any
act of kindness you may bestow upon
me; be generous then, and be assured it
shall be an inviolable secret."
<P 89>
[^FRANCIS, BETSY'S BROTHER INTERRUPTS.^]
[^...^] "What is the meaning of
this," [$said he:$] "Sister, how came you
here?" "Ask me no questions at
present," [$replied she, scarce able to speak,
so strangely had her late fright seized on
her spirits,$] "but see me safe from this
cursed house, and that worst of men."
[$Her speaking in this manner, made mr.
<P 90>
Francis apprehend the whole, and perhaps
more than the truth.$] "How, sir!" [$said
he, darting a furious look on the
gentleman-commoner,$] "what is it I hear? --
have you dared to -- ?" "Whatever
I have dared to," [$interrupted the other,$]
"I am capable of defending." "'Tis
well," [$rejoined the brother of miss Betsy,$]
"perhaps, I may put you to the trial;
but this is not a time or place." [^...^]
[^FLORA AND HER GENTLEMAN APPEAR.^]
[^---^] [$they saw her coming out of
the garden, led by the young student,
who, as soon as he beheld mr. Francis,
cried,$] "ha! Frank, how came you here?
you look out of humour." "How I
came here, it matters not," [$replied he,
sullenly;$] "and as to my being out of
humour, perhaps you may know better
than I yet do, what cause I have for
being so."
<P 92>
[^BETSY HAS TOLD HER BROTHER ABOUT THE GENTLEMEN AND 
IS ADDRESSED BY FLORA.^]
[^---^] "By your own account," [$said she,$]
"no harm was done to you; but some
people love to make a bustle about
nothing." "And some people," [$replied
miss Betsy, tartly,$] "love nothing but the
gratifications of their own passions, and
having no sense of virtue or modesty
themselves, can have no regard to that
<P 93>
of another." "What do you mean,
miss?" [$cried the other, with a pert air.$]
"My meaning is pretty plain," [$rejoined
miss Betsy;$] "but since you affect so much
ignorance, I must tell you, that the
expectations of a second edition of the
same work mr. Gayland had helped
you to compose, though from another
quarter, tempted you to sneak out of
the room, and leave your friend in
danger of falling a sacrifice to what her
soul most detests and scorns." [$These
words stung miss Flora to the quick; her
face was in an instant covered with a
scarlet blush, and every feature betrayed the
confusion of her mind; but recovering
herself from it, much sooner than most
others of her age could have done:$] "Good
lack," [$cried she,$] "I fancy you are
setting up for a prude; but pray, how
came mr. Gayland into your head? --
What, because I told you he innocently
romped with me one day in the 
chamber, are you so censorious as to infer
any thing criminal passed between us?"
"Whatever I infer," [$replied miss Betsy,
disdainfully,$] "I have better vouchers for
the truth of, than your report, and
would advise you, when you go home,
to get the chink in the pannel of the
wainscot of my lady's dressing-room
stopped up, or your next rendezvous
<P 94>
with that gentleman, may possibly have
witnesses of more ill-nature than
myself." "That can scarcely be," [$said
miss Flora, ready to burst with vexation;$]
"but don't think I value your little
malice; you are only angry because he
slighted the advances you made him,
and took all opportunities to shew how
much his heart and judgment gave
the preference to me." [$These words
so piqued the vanity of miss Betsy, that
not able to bear she should continue in the
imagination of being better liked than
herself, though even by the man she hated,
told her the sollicitations he had made to
her, the letter she had received from him,
and the rebuff she had given him upon
it;$] "so that," [$pursued she,$] "it was not
till after he found there was no hopes
of gaining me, that he carried his
devoirs to you."

   [$Miss Flora was more nettled at this
eclaircisement, than she was at the
discovery she now perceived the other had
made of her intrigue: she pretended,
however, not to believe a word of what
she had said; but willing to evade all
farther discourse on that head, returned to
the adventure they had just gone through
with the Oxonians.$] "Never expect,"
[$said she,$] "to pass it upon any one of
<P 95>
common sense, that if you had not a
mind to have been alone with that
terrible man, as you now describe him,
you would have staid in the room after
I was gone, and called to you to
follow."
[^BETSY AND FLORA CONTINUE.^]
[^---^] "Come, come, miss Betsy, 'tis
a folly to think to impose upon the
world by such shallow artifices: -- what
your inclinations are is evident enough;
any one may see, that if it had not been
for your brother's unseasonable
interruption, no-body would ever have
heard a word of those insults you now
so heavily complain of."

[^LADY MELLASIN APPEARS DRESSED IN A HOODED CLOAK: 
FLORA AND BETSY SEE HER.^]
[^...^] "Is your ladyship
going out in that dress," [$cried miss Flora;
but miss Betsy said nothing.$] "Aye,
child," [$replied the lady, somewhat
faultering in her speech,$] "a poor relation, who
they say is dying, has sent to beg to see
me." [^...^]
<P 126>
[^FLORA TO BETSY.^]
[^---^] "I am
resolved not to be infected with it, so
you must not take it ill if I leave you
alone for a few hours; for I should
think it a sin against common-sense,
to sit moping at home without shewing
myself to any one soul in the world,
after having taken all this pains in
dressing." [$Miss Betsy assured her, as
she might do with a great deal of
sincerity, that she should not be at all
displeased to be entirely free from any
company whatsoever for the whole evening;
and to prove the truth of what she said,
gave orders that instant to be denied to
whoever should come to visit her.$] "Well,"
[$cried miss Flora, laughing,$] "I shall give
your compliments, however, where I
am going," [$and then mentioned the
names of some persons she had just then
taken into her head to visit.$] "As you
please for that," [$replied miss Betsy,
with the same gay air;$] "but don't tell
them it is because I am eaten up with
the vapours, that I choose to stay at
home rather than carry my compliments
in person; for if ever I find out,"
[$continued she,$] "that you are so mischievous,
I shall contrive some way or other to
be revenged on you."

[^BETSY IS WRITING A LETTER TO A YOUNG LADY CALLED MISS FORWARD, 
WHEN FLORA ENTERS.^]
   [$Miss Flora had not been present when
the maid delivered the letter to miss Betsy;
but coming into the chamber just as she
had finished, and was sealing up the 
answer to it:$] "So," [$said she,$] "have I
catched you? Pray what new lover
have you been writing to this
morning?" [$It was in vain that miss Betsy
told her, she never yet had seen the man
she thought worthy of a letter from her,
on the score of love: the other persisted in
her asseverations; and miss Betsy to silence
her railery was obliged to shew her some
part of the letter she had received from
miss Forward.

   It being near breakfast-time they went
down together into the parlour, and as
they were drinking their Coffee,$] "Well,
pretty lady," [$said mr. Goodman to miss
Betsy, with a smile,$] "how did you like
the gentleman that dined here 
yesterday." [$This question so much surprised
her, that she could not help blushing.$]
"Like him, Sir," [$replied she,$] "I did
not take any notice of him. -- I
remember a stranger was here, and staid
a good while, and that is all; for I
neither observed any thing he said, or
did, or thought on him since." "The
agreeable confusion," [$cried mr.
<P 140>
Goodman, gaily,$] "you are in at my
mentioning him, makes me believe you remarked
him more than you are willing to
acknowlege, and I am very glad of it. --
You do him but justice I assure you,
for he is very much in love with you.

   "Lord, sir," [$said miss Betsy, blushing
still more,$] "I cannot imagine what makes
you talk so; I don't suppose the man
thinks of me any more than I do of him."
"That may be," [$rejoined he, laughing
outright. Lady Mellasin then took up
the word, and told her husband, he was
very merry that morning.$] "Aye," [$said
he,$] "the hurry of spirits I have put poor
miss Betsy in, has made me so; but I
can assure you the thing is very serious;
but," [$continued he,$] "you shall know 
the whole of it."

PERMISSION TO PROPOSE TO BETSY.^]
[^...^] "Having this
sanction," [$continued mr. Goodman,$]
"and believing it may be a very proper
match for both of you, I brought
him home with me to dinner
yesterday, and should be glad to know how
far you think you can approve of the
offer before I give him my consent to
make it."

   "I have already told you, sir," [$replied
miss Betsy,$] "that I took but little notice
of the gentleman; -- or, if I had,
should never have asked myself the
<P 142>
question, whether I could like him or
not; for as to marriage, I do assure
you, sir, it is a thing that has never
yet entered into my head." "Nay, as
to that," [$returned he,$] "it is time
enough, indeed. -- A good husband,
however, can never come unseasonably.
-- I shall tell him, he may visit you,
and leave you to answer the addresses
according to the dictates of your heart."

[^...^] "Here is a lady wants
you," [$said the hag, who ushered in
miss Betsy.$] [^...^]
[^BETSY AND MISS FORWARD.^]
"My dear miss Betsy," [$said she,$] "I do
not wonder you are alarmed at
<P 145>
finding me in a condition so different from
what you might have expected: my
letter indeed gave you a hint of some
misfortunes that had befallen me; but I
forbore letting you know of what
nature they were, because the facts,
without the circumstances, which would have
been too long to communicate by
writing, might have made me appear more
criminal, than I flatter myself you will
think I really am, when you shall be
told the whole of my unhappy story."

   [$Miss Betsy then assured her, she should
take a friendly part in every thing that had
happened to her, and that nothing could
oblige her more than the confidence she
mentioned: on which the other taking her
by the hand, and letting fall some tears,
said,$] "O miss Betsy! miss Betsy, -- I have
suffered much, and if you find a great
deal to blame me for, you will find yet
much more to pity." [$Then after
having paused a little, as if to recollect the
passages she was about to relate, began in
this manner:$]
[^MISS FORWARD'S NARRATIVE ABOUT HER ADVENTURE WITH A MAN 
IN A LORD'S GARDEN OMITTED.^]
<P 149>
   "Heavens!" [$cried miss Betsy,
interrupting her,$] "how I envied your
happiness a moment since, and how I tremble
for you now."

   "O miss Betsy," [$replied miss Forward,$]
"every thing would have been done in
that forgetful hour; but as I have
already said, there was not an opportunity."

<S SAMPLE 7>
<P 187>
[^GOODMAN AND BETSY.^]
[^---^] "miss 
Betsy," [$said he,$] "you have used me
very ill: I did not think you would
<P 188>
have made a fool of me in the manner
you have done." "Bless me, sir,"
[$cried she,$] "in what have I offended?"
"You have not only offended against me,"
[$answered he, very hastily,$] "but also
against your own reason, and common
understanding: you are young, 'tis
true, yet not so young as not to know
it is both ungenerous and silly to
impose upon your friends." "I scorn the
thought, sir, of imposing upon any
body," [$said she;$] "I therefore desire,
sir, you will tell me what you mean
by so unjust an accusation." "Unjust!"
[$resumed he,$] "I appeal to the whole world,
if it were well done of you to suffer
me to encourage my friend's courtship
to you, when at the same time your
brother had engaged you to receive the
addresses of another."

   [$Miss Betsy, though far from thinking
it a fault in her to hear the proposals of
a hundred lovers, had as many offered
themselves, was yet a little shocked at the
reprimand given her by mr. Goodman;
and not being able presently to make any
reply to what he had said, he took a
letter he had just received from her brother
out of his pocket, and threw it on the
table, with these words:$] "That will shew,"
[$said he,$] "whether I have not cause to
<P 189>
resent your behaviour in this point."
[$Perceiving she was about to take it up,$]
"Hold," [$cried he,$] "my wife shall read
it, and be the judge between us."
[^THE LETTER FROM BETSY'S BROTHER IS READ: IT MENTIONS THAT 
A MR. TRUEWORTH IS COMING TO COURT HER.^]
<P 191>
   "O, fye miss Betsy," [$said lady
Mellasin,$] "how could you serve mr. Goodman
so? What will mr. Staple say, when he
comes to know he was encouraged to
court a woman that was already
pre-engaged." "Pre-engaged, madam,"
[$cried miss Betsy, in a scornful tone,$]
"what to a man I never saw but three
times in my whole life, and whose
mouth never uttered a syllable of love
to me." [$She was going on, but mr.
Goodman, who was still in a great heat,
interrupted her, saying,$] "No matter
whether he has uttered any thing of the
business or not, it seems you are enough
acquainted with his sentiments, and I
doubt not but he knows you are, or he
would not have taken a journey to
London on your account. You ought
therefore to have told me of his coming,
and what your brother had wrote
concerning him, and I should then have
<P 192>
let mr. Staple know it would be to no
purpose to make any courtship to you,
as I did to another just before I came
home, who I find has taken a great
fancy to you; but I have given him
his answer; for my part I do not
understand this way of making
gentlemen lose their time."
[^LADY MELLASIN CONVINCES GOODMAN THAT BETSY SHOULD HEAR 
WHAT EACH LOVER HAS TO OFFER: GOODMAN TALKS TO BETSY.^]
<P 194>
   [$Mr. Goodman in this, as in every thing
else, suffered himself to be directed by her
judgment, and the next morning, when
miss Betsy came down, talked to her with
his usual pleasantry.$] "Well," [$said he,$]
"have you forgiven my ill humour last
night? I was a little vexed to think
my friend Staple had so poor a chance
for gaining you, and the more so
because Frank Thoughtless will take it ill
of me, that I have done any thing in
opposition to the person he
recommends; but you must act as you
please; for my part I shall not meddle
any farther in these affairs.

   "Sir," [$replied miss Betsy, very gravely,$]
"I shall always be thankful to my friends
for their advice, and whenever I think
seriously of a husband shall not fail to
intreat yours in my choice; but,"
[$continued she,$] "one would imagine my
brother, by writing so pressingly to you,
wanted to hurry me into a marriage
whether I would or no; and though I
have as much regard for him, as a
sister can or ought to have, yet I shall
never be prevailed upon by him to
enter into a state to which at present I
have rather an aversion than inclination."
<P 195>
   "That is," [$said mr. Goodman,$] "you
have rather an aversion, than an
inclination, to the persons who address
you on that score." "No, sir,"
[$answered she,$] "not at all: the persons and
behaviour, both of mr. Trueworth and
mr. Staple, appear to me to be
unexceptionable; but sure one may allow a
man to have merit, and be pleased with
his conversation, without desiring to be
tacked to him for ever. I verily
believe I shall never be in love; but if I
am, it must be a long length of time,
and a series of persevering assiduities
must make me so."
[^BETSY RECEIVES A LETTER FROM HER THIRD LOVER, A MR. HYSOM.^]
<P 197>
[^...^] [$Having finished the 
whole, she turned to mr. Goodman, and 
putting it into his hands,$] "Be pleased,
sir, to read that," [$said she,$] "you shall
own, at least, that I do not make a
secret of all my lovers to you." [$Mr.
Goodman soon looked it over, and after
returning it to her,$] "How troublesome a
thing it is," [$said he,$] "to be the
guardian of a beautiful young lady! whether
<P 198>
I grant, or whether I refuse the consent
required of me, I equally gain ill-will
from one side or the other."

   [$Lady Mellasin, who had all this 
morning complained of a violent head-ach, and
said nothing during this conversation, now
cried out,$] "What new conquest is this
miss Betsy has made?" "O, madam,"
[$replied miss Betsy,$] "your ladyship shall
judge of the value of it, by the
doughty epistle I have just received."
[^BETSY GIVES THE LETTER TO FLORA, WHO READS ALOUD.^]
[^...^] "You are all very merry,"
[$said mr. Goodman,$] "but I can tell you,
captain Hysom is a match that many
a fine lady in this town would jump at;
he has been twenty-five years in the
service of the East-India company, has
made very successful voyages, and is
immensely rich; he has lived at sea,
indeed, the greatest part of his life, and
much politeness cannot be expected from
him; but he is a very honest
<P 199>
good-natured man, and I believe means well.
I wish he had offered himself to Flora."
"Perhaps, sir, I should not have refused
him," [$replied she, briskly;$] "I should
like a husband prodigiously that would
be abroad for three whole years
together, and leave me to bowl about in
my coach and six, while he ploughed
the ocean in search of new treasures to
throw into my lap at his return."

   "Well, well," [$said miss Betsy,
laughing still more,$] "who knows but when I
have teized him a little, he may fly for
shelter to your more clement goodness."
"Aye! aye," [$cried mr. Goodman,$] "you
are a couple of mad-caps, indeed, and
I suppose between you both the captain
will be finely managed; but no matter,
I shall not pity him, as I partly told
him what he might expect."

   [$After this mr. Goodman went out, and
the young ladies went up to dress against
dinner, diverting themselves all the time
with the poor captain's letter. Miss Betsy
told miss Flora, that as he was for coming
so directly to the point, she must use all
her artifice, in order to keep him in
suspence;$] "for," [$said she,$] "if I should let
him know any part of my real
sentiments concerning him, he would be
<P 200>
gone at once, and we should lose all
our sport: I will, therefore," [$continued
she,$] "make him believe, that I dare not
openly encourage his pretensions,
because my brother had recommended one
gentleman to me, and mr. Goodman
another; but shall assure him, at the
same time, that I am inclined to neither
of them, and shall contrive to get rid
of them both, as soon as possible: this,"
[$said she,$] "will keep him in hopes,
without my downright promising any thing
in his particular favour."
<P 201>
[^THE HOUSE-MAID TO MISS BETSY.^]
[^---^] [$and seeing that she was alone,$] "O
miss!" [$said she,$] "there is the devil to
do below." "I heard a sad noise,
indeed," [$said she carelesly.$] "Why you
must know, miss," [$cried the maid,$]
"that my lady had given John the
butler warning, and so his time being up,
mrs. Prinks had orders to pay him off
this morning, but would have stopped
thirty shillings for a silver orange strainer
that is missing. John would not allow
it, and being in a passion, told mrs.
Prinks, that he would not leave the
house without his full wages; that for
any thing he knew the strainer might
be gone after the diamond necklace.
This I suppose she repeated to my lady,
and that put her in so ill a humour
this morning, that if my master had
not come down as he did, we should
all have had something at our heads.
However," [$continued the wench,$] "she
ordered mrs. Prinks to give him his
whole money; but, would you believe
it, miss? My master was no sooner
<P 202>
gone out, than she came down into the
kitchen raving, and finding John there
still, (the poor fellow, God knows, only
stayed to take his leave of us,) she tore
about, and swore we should all go;
accused one of one thing, and another of
another." "Well, but what did the
fellow mean about the diamond necklace?"
[$cried miss Betsy, interrupting her.$] "I
will tell you the whole story," [$said she,$]
"but you must promise never to speak a
word of it to any body; for though I
do not value the place, nor will stay
much longer; yet they would not give
one a character, you know, miss."

   [$Miss Betsy then having assured her, she
would never mention it, the other shut the
door, and went on in a very low voice,
in this manner.$]

[^SOURCE TEXT USES SINGLE QUOTATION MARKS FROM THIS POINT; 
ON PAGES 202 AND 203.^]
   "Don't you remember, miss," [$said she,$]
"what a flurry my lady and mrs. Prinks
were in one day? how her ladyship
pulled off all her fine cloaths, and they
both went out in a hackney coach;
then mrs. Prinks came home, and went
out again?" "Yes," [$replied miss Betsy,$]
"I took notice they were both in a good
deal of confusion." "Aye, miss, well
they might," [$said Nanny;$] "that very
afternoon John was gone to see a Cousin
<P 203>
that keeps a pawn-broker's shop in
Thieving-lane, and as he was sitting in
a little room behind the counter, that
it seems shuts in with glass doors, who
should he see through the window, but
mrs. Prinks come in; she brought my
lady's diamond necklace, and pledged
it for a hundred and twenty, or a
hundred and thirty guineas, I am not sure
which he told me, for I have the
saddest memory; but it is no matter for
that. John was strangely confounded,
as you may think, but resolved to see
into the bottom, and when mrs. Prinks
was got into the coach, popped up
behind it, and got down when it stopped,
which was at the sign of the hand and
tipstaff in Knaves-acre; so that this
money was raised to get somebody that
was arrested out of the bailiff's hands,
for John said, it was what they call a
spunging-house that mrs. Prinks went
into. Lord! how deceitful some people
are, my poor master little thinks how
his money goes; but I'll warrant our
house-keeping must suffer for this."
