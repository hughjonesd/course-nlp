   [$ (^Memorandum^) , that besides the
examination, and confession aforesaid, there was giuen
in euidence, (^ (\viua voce\) ^) , at the Arraignement of
the said Witches, one speciall matter by an
Ostler of Windsore, who affirmed vpon his othe
that the said Mother Stile vsing to come to his
Maisters house, had often tymes reliefe giuen
her by hym. And on a time not long sithens, she
commyng to his Maisters house, when there
was little left to be giuen her, for that she came
somewhat late, yet he giuyng her also
somewhat at that tyme, she therewith not contented
went her waies in some anger, and as it semed
offended with the saied Ostler, for that she had
no better Almes, and by the sequell, so it
appered. For not long after, he had a greate ache
in his limmes, that he was not able to take any
reste, nor to doe any labour, and hauyng sought
many meanes for remedie thereof, could finde
none, at the laste he wente to a Wiseman,
named Father Rosimonde, (\ (^alias^) \) Osborne, who
told hym that he was bewitched, and that there
was many ill women in Windsore, and asked
hym whom he did mistrust, and the saied
Osteler aunswered one Mother Stile, one of the
<P B2R>
Witches aforesaied:$] well [$saied the Wiseman,$]
if you can meete her, and all to scratche her, so
that you drawe blood of her, you shall presently
mende. [$And the saied Osteler vpon his othe
declared, that he watchyng her on a tyme, did all
too scratche her by the face, that he made the
blood come after, & presently his paine went
awaie, so that he hath bin no more greued sithe~s.$]
   [$Moreouer, on a tyme a mannes Soonne of
Windsor, commyng to fetche water at a welle
whiche was by the doore of the saied Mother
Stile, and by chaunce hurlyng a stone vppon
her house, she was there withall muche
greeued and saied, she would bee euen with hym,
and tooke his Pitcher whiche he had brought
from hym: the boye goyng homewardes,
happened to meete with his father, and tolde hym
how that Mother Stile had taken awaye his
Pitcher from hym,$] well [$saied his Father,$] you
haue doen her some vnhappines, come on with
me, and I will goe speake with her. [$And so the
boye goyng with his Father towardes her
house, did sodainly crie out:$] (^O my hande my
hande^) , [$his father therewithall lookyng backe,
and seeyng his Soonnes hande to tourne, and
wende backwardes, laied holde therevpon, but
he was not able to staye the tournyng thereof,$]
