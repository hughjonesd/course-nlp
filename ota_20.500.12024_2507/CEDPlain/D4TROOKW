<P 49>
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, All that we say in answer to     #
this Objection,
is, That Mr. (^Harris^) is not nam'd in that Proclamation.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] What say you to that, Sir (^Bartholomew  #
Shower^) ? He
is not named in the Proclamation: And so if he hath Discovered and
Apprehended the Prisoner, he has earn'd his Money, whether he be
Convicted or not, because (^Rookwood's^) Name is in the Proclamation,
tho' his is not.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] Then, My Lord, with humble Submission, here #
is
another Proclamation wherein he is nam'd, we desire that may be read.
   [$ (^Mr. Sol. Gen.^) $] And when it is read, it will be as little #
to your
Purpose as the other.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Let them read what they please, we need say
nothing at all to it.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] Certainly upon this Proclamation there's #
no
Objection; for he is intitled to his One thousand Pound already, tho'
(^Rookwood^) be never convicted.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] But is he not by this Proclamation which    #
mentions his
Accomplices, intitled to his Pardon? If so, he swears to secure      #
himself.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] By the Apprehending and Discovering,     #
he's intitled
to his Pardon.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] But not without he be brought to Justice;   #
that is to
say, till he be convicted; therefore he cannot be an Evidence to
convict him.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] That is, as to any that are there named, #
if any of
them Discover and Apprehend one another, it must be so as that they
be brought to Justice: But if any Person that is not named there does
Apprehend any that is, he is intitled to the One Thousand Pound,     #
barely
by the Apprehension.
<P 50>
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] Then there is another Proclamation where    #
they are
both named, as Mr. (^Rookwood^) tells me.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] My Lord, We will set this Matter right;  #
we will
show the other Proclamation, in which, if I am rightly inform'd, for
I have not read it, Mr. (^Harris^) is nam'd.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] If you have not read it, I would advise   #
you not to
trouble the Court with it; for you will find the latter part is
restrain'd to Three or Four particular Persons, of which he is none.
   [$ (^Rookwood.^) $] I am named in the Proclamation.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Ay, but read the latter part of it, and   #
you will find
you are not nam'd in that Clause that they referr'd to: You need not
read the former part of the Proclamation, we agree the Prisoner is
named there; but only look towards the bottom, which is the Clause
that they refer to.
   [$ (^Cl. of Arr.^) (Reads) $] (^And we do hereby further Declare, #
&c.^)
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] They have not considered the              #
Proclamation, and
therefore make an Objection of they don't know what.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] We are in your Lordship's Judgment.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] For what? See if you can make or state a #
Case for
our Judgment.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] Mr. (^Rookwood^) is mention'd in the     #
first Proclamation,
and (^Harris^) is not, but there are the Word Accomplices: He is
likewise mentioned in the last Proclamation, but not in the last     #
Clause of
it. I confess, if he had, it had been plain it would have taken off  #
his
Testimony; but now we must submit it to you, whether he is not an
Interested Person, and consequently no good Witness.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] Truly I do not see any colour for the    #
Objection. Is
he not as well intituled to his One thousand Pound, tho' Mr.         #
(^Rookwood^)
had never been try'd, by the bare Apprehending of Mr. (^Rookwood^) , #
as
if he was Convicted?
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] No, my Lord; because the Words are so as #
he may
be brought to Justice.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] That is not so, as to any Person that    #
apprehends one
mentioned in the Proclamation, if the Person that apprehends be not
mention'd in it, and named himself; if any one that is not mention'd
apprehend one that is mention'd, he is intituled, by the Apprehension,
to the One thousand Pound. If any one that is mention'd apprehend
another, then he is to bring him to Justice; now Mr. (^Harris^) is not
named in this Proclamation, and so, as to the One thousand Pound, he
stands in the same Condition as any other Person that Discovered or
Apprehended one of the Persons there nam'd.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] But it seems he was one of the           #
Conspirators, because
he is himself described in another Proclamation.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] If it were so, it would not be material,  #
nor any
manner of Objection; but as they have made their Objection upon these
Proclamations, we think there is nothing for us to give an Answer to.
   [$ (^Mr. Cowper,^) $] Nay, my Lord, if it were so, will Sir       #
(^Bartholomew
Shower^) say his Client is not brought to Justice, unless he be      #
Convicted?
I am sure the Words (^Convicted^) , or (^Attainted^) , are not in    #
the Proclamation.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt,^) $] There is nothing in it; you must swear   #
Mr. (^Harris^) ,
[$which was done accordingly.$] 
   [$ (^Mr. Sol. Gen.^) $] Will you give an Account to my Lord and   #
the Jury,
what you know of this Conspiracy against the King's Life, from the
<P 51>
first time you were acquainted with it, and what hand the Prisoner at
the Bar had in it.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray give an Account of the whole thing,  #
your
coming over, and who sent you, and upon what Errant, and the whole
that you know of this Conspiracy.
   [$ (^Capt. Harris,^) $] Upon the 14th. of (^January^) last, the   #
French Stile, New
Stile, I was at St. (^Germains^) , where I was sent for by King      #
(^James^) , and
was ordered to wait his Dinner till it was over, and accordingly I did
wait till his Dinner was over, and then I came in, and Col.          #
(^Parker^) was
with him, and one Mr. (^Hare^) who is also mentioned in the 
Proclamation, was there also: the King told me he was sensible I had #
served him
well, and now he had an Opportunity of doing something for me;
he told me he would send me into (^England^) , where I should be
subsisted, and I was to follow the Orders of Sir (^George            #
Barclay^) , and
accordingly he ordered me Ten Lewidores to be paid by Mr.            #
(^Caroll^) , who
is Secretary to the late Queen, and Col. (^Parker^) went along with  #
me, 
and Mr. (^Hare^) , to (^Caroll^) , and told him he came from the     #
King, and we
had the Lewidores, and we went to (^Calais^) , in order to our coming
over hither: but we were told if we were Wind-bound, that the
Money we received would not bear our Charges; there was Orders given
for our further Subsistance at (^Calice^) , to the President there. 
Accordingly we came to (^Calice^) , and the Wind did not serve us    #
for 8 or 9 
days; and while I stay'd there, the Money that I spent at (^Calice^) #
was
paid by the President of (^Calice^) , Monsieur (^Latour^) .          #
Afterwards I
Landed in (^England^) , near (^Romney Marsh^) , as I was told, and I #
came to the
House of one (^Hunt^) , and he provided me and my Comrade with a 
Couple of Horses; and coming from thence, I came in the first place to
one (^Tucker's^) an Apothecary in (^Sandway^) , and next from        #
thence, we
came to (^Rochester^) , to (^Charles Crofts's^) , and from thence in #
a Coach to
(^Gravesend^) , and from thence by Water to (^London^) : that night  #
we lay
in (^Grace-Church-street^) at an Inn, it being night, the            #
Night-Tyde, and
something late. The next day I came to a Lodging at an Acquaintance
of my Comrades, Mr. (^Hare^) , at the (^Unicorn^) in                 #
(^Brownlow-street^) , one
Mr. (^Wateman's^) . The next night I went to look for Sir (^George
Barclay^) , whom the King told me I should certainly find by such a  #
Sign of
a White Handkerchief hanging out of his Pocket, on (^Mondays^) and
(^Thursdays^) , in (^Covent-Garden^) , where his walk was to be in   #
the Evening,
because he was not to appear in the day-time openly. It happen'd that
upon (^Monday^) night after I came to Town, I went there, and did not
find Sir (^George Barclay^) according to the King's Direction, which I
admired at; but there was one Mr. (^Berkenhead^) , who told my       #
Comrade, 
a Day or two after, That Sir (^George Barclay^) would needs speak with
me, and accordingly I met with him; and he asked me how the
King, Queen, Prince, and Princess did, and I told him they were
very well; I told him I was appointed to attend him, and obey his
Orders. He told me he had no Money at present, but in two or three
Days he would send some; and so he did, by Major (^Holmes^) . I had
Five Shillings a Day for subsistance, and I had no Horse; and when I
had a Horse, it was Six Shillings a Day; after which rate I had
subsistance for a Month at Five Shillings a Day, Guinea's going then #
at
Thirty Shillings. Major (^Holmes^) pay'd me the Money by Sir (^George
Barclay's^) Order, as he told me, and he afterwards gave me a Guinea,
and that was the first (^Saturday^) when the Assassination was       #
design'd;
<P 52>
for that we told him we wanted Money, and it was not reasonable we
should take our Horses out of the Stable before we pay'd for them:
And I met Sir (^George Barclay^) several times at                    #
(^Covent-Garden^) , and he
told me it was a suspicious Place, and desired me not to come any
more there; but when he had any particular Orders to give me, he
wou'd give me notice of it where I shou'd meet him; and accordingly
I did meet him several times.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Now Sir, will you tell what you know as   #
to the 
Prisoner at the Bar.
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] As to Mr. (^Rookwood^) , the (^Saturday^) #
that the
Assassination was design'd to be, the first time that I knew of it,  #
I met Mr.
(^Rookwood^) , at one Mr. (^Burck's^) Lodging, where he was up, and  #
I saw him in
a great Hurry and some Consternation, and in came Mr. (^Bernarde^) ; #
I
ask'd him the meaning of it, and what they were going about; and
Mr. (^Rookwood^) told me, If I wou'd go down to Captain (^Counter^)  #
I shou'd
know; accordingly I went, and to the best of my remembrance, he
gave me a little Note to Captain (^Counter^) , but that I am not     #
positive
in. I went to Captain (^Counter^) , and as soon as ever I came, he   #
told us,
We must be immediately ready to go to (^Turnham Green^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Where was that?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] At the (^Woolpack^) , that was the Sign   #
-- as near as
I remember. Mr. (^Hare^) and I were ordered together to come there,
and there was Mr. (^Hungate^) , who had been there some time, and when
I came in, Sir (^George Barclay^) did declare Laughing, (^These are my
Janisaries^) : And he talk'd something of bringing the Garter, and of
attacking the Coach; but he went out of the Room, and afterwards he  #
came
in and declared, (^We were all Men of Honour, and that the Business we
were going about, was to attack the Prince of^) Orange; but          #
(^Durant^) came
in after that, and said, (^The Prince of^) Orange (^did not go out   #
that Day^) .
When he talk'd of attacking the Prince of (^Orange^) , I was very much
startled, not knowing any thing of it before; and I came the next    #
Morning
to Mr. (^Rookwood^) , and ask'd him if we were to be the Murderers of
the Prince of (^Orange^) , says Mr. (^Rookwood^) to me, (^I am       #
afraid we are
drawn into some such Business; but if I had known of it before I     #
came over,
I should have beg'd the King's Pardon at St.^) Germains, (^and not   #
have come
over hither^) ; and said I, (^This is very fine, we have serv'd to a #
very good
purpose, to be sent over upon such an Errant and Account^) . After   #
this
Mr. (^Rookwood^) , and Mr. (^Lowick^) , and I, had a Meeting at      #
(^Red-Lyon-Fields^) ,
where we did discourse about the Matter. I did often declare against
it, That it was so barbarous a thing, that no Man of Honour almost
wou'd be guilty of it, but Major (^Lowick^) answered, That we were to
obey Orders, for sure Sir (^George Barclay^) wou'd not undertake a   #
thing
of that nature without Orders.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray what said Mr. (^Rookwood^) .
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] He own'd it was a barbarous thing; but he #
was sent
over to obey Sir (^George Barclay's^) Orders, which he had several   #
times
declared he was resolved to do; upon that we parted: so afterwards
I came to Mr. (^Rookwood's^) Lodging; it was the (^Saturday^)        #
Morning I
came to him, and so went to Sir (^George Barclay's^) ; while he was  #
there,
Mr. (^Rookwood^) gave me a Note, naming so many Names,
particularly Mr. (^Hungate^) , Mr. (^Hanford^) , Mr. (^Hare^) , and  #
his own Name at
top, not the Name that he is Arraigned by here; but a sham Name
that he had, as the rest of us all had sham Names, which at that time
we went by.
<P 53>
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] What was your Name?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] My Name was (^Jenkins^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] Who gave you that Name?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] King (^James^) at St. (^Germains^) , and  #
he gave Mr. (^Hare^)
the Name of (^Guiney^) , and Mr. (^Rookwood's^) Name was             #
(^Roberts^) . King
(^James^) told us in his Bed-Chamber, We were to go by those Names.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray Sir, what did (^Rookwood^) say to    #
you when he
gave you that List?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] He told me, he was to go to (^Turnham     #
Green^) , and I
was to go along with him, and says he to me smiling, (^You shall be
my^) Aid de Camp; and get the rest of the Gentlemen ready, and
accordingly I went to look for several of the Persons -- particularly
for Mr. (^Blackburn^) : When I came back again, I found him lying on
his Bed, and that Sir (^George Barclay^) had told him the Prince of  #
(^Orange^)
did not go out that Day, and from thence we went to Dinner, where
Major (^Lowick^) din'd with us, and Mr. (^Bernarde^) , and Major     #
(^Lowick^)
seeing me in a heat, ask'd me, Why I was in such a Sweat, I told him
I were getting those Men ready for Mr. (^Rookwood^) , who had made
me his (^Aid de Camp^) ; says Major (^Lowick^) to me, You may very   #
well
do it; for you have six Shillings a Day allow'd you, and I have      #
nothing;
I bring two Men at my own charge: said I, Major (^Lowick^) , I
wonder you don't apply your self to Sir (^George Barclay^) , and     #
then, I believe
you may be subsisted too. He answered me, He did not think it worth
the while to trouble him, since he hath never spoke to him of it     #
before,
and (^Rookwood^) , and (^Bernarde^) , and (^Lowick^) , and my self,  #
several times
met in (^Red-Lyon-Fields^) , and talk'd of attacking the Prince of   #
(^Orange^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Who did?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] (^Rookwood^) , (^Bernarde^) ,             #
(^Lowick^) , and my self. 
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray Sir, let me ask you one Question.    #
Where was
your Horse at first?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] At first it was at my Lord                #
(^Feversham's^) Stables, as they
told me, in (^Somerset-House^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Where were the other Persons Horses?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] There was Mr. (^Hungate's^) , and Mr.     #
(^Hare's^) Horses in
the same Place, at the same time, as they told me.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] How came you by your Horse there?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Major (^Holmes^) did deliver my Horse,    #
and committed it
to my care, and I carry'd it thence to another place.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did you observe there was any more Horses #
there?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] I believe there was Five or Six, as near  #
as I can guess.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Do you know where (^Rookwood^) was to     #
have his Horse?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] He had a Horse; but whence he had it I    #
don't know.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Had you any Arms delivered you?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Yes, I had, by Capt. (^Counter^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] Were you at no other Place together that   #
(^Saturday^)
Night, the 22d. of (^February^) , because you say you din'd together?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Yes, we were at the (^Bear^) Tavern.
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] What Discourse pass'd between you there?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] They were talking about the               #
Assassination; but what
any particular Person said, I cannot tell.
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] Pray who were there?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] There was Mr. (^Knightly^) , Capt.        #
(^Rookwood^) , and
Mr. (^King^) ; and (^Knightly^) went out and came in again, and
<P 54>
declared, we must have a great deal of care of our selves, or we     #
shou'd be
taken up; and he whisper'd it first, and afterwards I ask'd him what
it was, and he told me, and said, (^We must have a care of our       #
selves^) :
Says Mr. (^King^) , staring this way with his Eyes, (^Surely God     #
Almighty
is on our side^) ; and so we parted.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] When was this?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] This was the Night of (^Saturday^) the    #
22d. when it
was discovered; for some of them were taken up the next Day.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Was (^Rookwood^) there at that time at    #
the (^Bear-Tavern^) ? [^NO ITALICS FOR Tavern IN SOURCE TEXT.^]
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] I cannot possibly say whether he was or   #
not.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] What Discourse had you there?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] We talk'd of Assassinating the King; but  #
what it was
in particular, I cannot tell.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] Was (^Rookwood^) there?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Yes, I believe he was; but I cannot       #
positively say.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] You say it was the last (^Saturday^)     #
that the King was to
go abroad, that you apprehended you were discovered?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Yes, we apprehended we were discovered    #
before that;
for Mr. (^Lowick^) told me, That Three or Four Days before, in that
Week, that his Name, and one (^Harrison's^) , were given into the
Council, and another, and another, Two or Three of them, as he told  #
me;
I think, Three or Four; and upon that Account Major (^Lowick^) went
from his Lodging, and did not lie at his Lodging the Night before;
and I came to Major (^Lowick^) , and he told me the same thing at the
(^King's-Arms^) Tavern.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Can you Remember what Discourse you had   #
that 
(^Saturday^) Night?
   [$ (^Mr. Cowper^) $] You say that on (^Saturday^) the 22d. Mr.    #
(^Rookwood^) gave
you the List.
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] I do not say it was the 22d. for I cannot #
swear to the
Day of the Month; but it was the Second (^Saturday^) that we were to
have gone about this Business. 
   [$ (^Mr. Cowper.^) $] You say he gave you a List of Names: Pray,  #
when he
gave you that List, what Discourse happened in the Room, just before,
or after the giving of the List?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Sir, I think I told the Court that before.
   [$ (^Mr. Cowper.^) $] Sir, I desire you would repeat it.
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] My Lord, I humbly desire to know whether  #
I am to
answer that Gentleman [^SOURCE TEXT: Gentlemen^] that Question?
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] Yes, you are to answer, being upon your  #
Oath, and
to tell the whole Truth.
   [$ (^Mr. Cowper.^) $] I ask him the Question so fairly, what      #
Discourse
introduced the giving of the List, and what followed upon it, that I
perceive this Gentleman does not know which side I am off.
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Mr. (^Rookwood^) said we were to go to    #
(^Turnham-Green^) ;
and he told me, that I was to be one of his Party, that we were to
attack the Prince of (^Orange^) .
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] You say you were to be one of his Party: #
Pray was it
there that he told you, you should be his (^Aid de Camp^) .
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Yes, he did tell me I was to be his (^Aid #
de Camp^) ?
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] Whose Hand-writing was that List?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] I cannot tell, I had it from that         #
Gentleman.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] But whose Writing was it?
<P 55>
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Indeed I know not his Hand-writing, and   #
therefore
cannot tell whose it was: He is for his Life, but I believe he cannot
deny any thing that I have said, I suppose not: I shou'd be very sorry
to accuse Mr. (^Rookwood^) of any thing that was not true.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] Pray whose Names were in that List?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] I have mention'd Mr. (^Hare^) , Mr.       #
(^Hanford^) , Mr. 
(^Blackburn^) , my self; and you, Mr. (^Rookwood^) , had your own    #
Name at top.
   [$ (^Rookwood.^) $] What is that (^Blackburn^) ?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] He is a (^Lancashire^) Man.
   [$ (^Rookwood.^) $] It's a very strange thing I should give you a #
List with a
Man's Name that I don't know; I declare it, I know no such Person.
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Mr. (^Rookwood^) , I believe you are very #
sensible I do not
accuse you of any thing that is not true.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] When did you see that List last?
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] He gave it into my Hands, and had it from #
me again, 
or I threw it away afterwards.
   [$ (^Rookwood.^) $] But you that were to be an Evidence, ought to #
have kept
it to justifie your Evidence.
   [$ (^Capt. Harris.^) $] Truly I did not intend to have been an    #
Evidence at
that time.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] If they will ask him any Questions let    #
them.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] No indeed, I will ask him no Questions.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Then, my Lord, we have another piece of   #
Evidence
which we wou'd offer to your Lordship, which is not direct Evidence
against the Prisoner, but only to prove a Circumstance or two of what
has already been sworn: We do acknowledge, my Lord, it does not
affect Mr. (^Rookwood^) , but only to strengthen and confirm what    #
they
have sworn.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] With submission we hope it will not be   #
Evidence fit
to be given as to the Prisoner at all; for because a Man may swear
true in the particular Circumstance of a thing, that therefore he    #
swears
true what he swears against the Prisoner, I think is no Consequence in
the World.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] It is a thing distinct, and foreign to   #
the Matter, as to
Mr. (^Rookwood^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, we do not say it directly        #
affects Mr. 
(^Rookwood^) ; but when your Lordship has heard it, we shall submit  #
it to you,
how far it confirms even the Evidence given against him.
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] My Lord, we say the Prisoner was to have   #
his Horse
from (^Somerset-House^) ; and that there were Horses plac'd there    #
for that
purpose we are going to prove.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, It is one entire Conspiracy, in  #
which 
every one had his part; one was to have his Horses and his Party in  #
one
place, and another in another: Now that there were at such time such
Horses at (^Somerset-House^) , and those Horses were delivered out   #
from
(^Somerset-House^) , is certainly a Confirmation of the Truth of     #
what the
Witnesses have said.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] It is so. If that be it you offer, it is #
very material.
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] We shall prove, That upon the              #
Disappointment on
the first (^Saturday^) , the 15th. of (^February^) , they were to be #
ready against
the 22d. and you will hear how the Horses were disposed of in the
mean time. Call (^Chamberlain^) , (^Maskel^) , and (^Allen^) .
<P 56>
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Call any one of them, I believe it is     #
enough.
[$ (^Mr.^) Chamberlain (^appeared, and was sworn^) .$]
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray will you give my Lord, and the Jury an
Account what you know of any Horses that were brought to             
(^Somerset-House^) about (^February^) last, and how long they stay'd #
there?
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] There was Six Horses.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Who brought them in.
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] They were sent in by some Persons in Mr.   #
(^Lewis's^) Name.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Had you any Direction to take care of them?
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] Mr. (^Lewis^) sent in a Note to take care  #
of them for a
Night or two.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Who carried them away?
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] I cannot tell: Some People came to see 'em #
that I
never saw before, and they took care of them; I know not who they
were, and I never saw them since.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] What time was it that they came for them?
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] It was about the middle of the Day.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] What Month was it in?
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] I think it was much about the latter end   #
of (^February^) ,
to the best of my Remembrance.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] How long was it before the Plot was       #
discovered?
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] It was about a Week, or a small matter,    #
before the
Plot was discovered, to the best of my knowledge.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] How long stay'd the Horses there at       #
(^Somerset-House^) ?
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] Three of them staid a Night or two; but    #
the other
Three about a matter of a Week or Ten Days.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Who own'd those Horses?
   [$ (^Chamberlain.^) $] They were sent in, in Mr. (^Lewis's^)      #
Name; but who
own'd them I cannot tell indeed.
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] Then swear (^John Allen^) . [$ (^ (Which   #
was done.) ^) $]
Pray tell my Lords, and the Jury, what you know concerning any
Horses about the time of the Breaking-out of the Plot.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] We mean in (^Somerset-House^) Stable. 
   [$ (^Allen.^) $] There were Seven Horses came in.
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] Who brought them?
   [$ (^Allen.^) $] There was Six in the first place; one came in    #
afterwards, in
the Evening.
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] By whose Order were they brought there?
   [$ (^Allen.^) $] By Mr. (^Lewis's^) Order.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] How long did they stay there?
   [$ (^Allen.^) $] Some of them stay'd there several Days; Three of #
them
went away the next Day, as I think.
   [$ (^Mr. Conyers.^) $] Do you remember about what time those      #
Horses were
brought thither?
   [$ (^Allen.^) $] They were brought there I believe about Seven or #
Eight Days
before the Plot broke out.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, we only call these Witnesses to  #
confirm the
Testimony of the others, that there were such Horses there at that
time, and for the present we rest it here.
   [$ (^L. C. J. Holt.^) $] Then, Gentlemen, what say you to it for  #
the Prisoner?
[^SIR B. SHOWER'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED.^]
<P 57>
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Sir (^Bartholomew Shower^) , I know not   #
what Variety
of Opinions you mean; there have been some Discourses in Pamphlets
I agree, but it was always taken and held for Law, that Consulting
and Agreeing was an Overt-Act.
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] Here is no Evidence of any Agreement.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Pray let us hear what you say to that.
[^SIR B. SHOWER'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED.^]
<P 58>
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] My Lord, we humbly insist there are not two 
VVitnesses, such as the Law requires, to prove the Charge upon this 
Indictment against the Prisoner: The two Overt-Acts that touch Mr. 
(^Rookwood^) , are first Consulting and Agreeing how to Kill the     #
King; the other
is the finding Arms and Horses for that purpose: but as to this      #
latter,
the finding Arms and Horses, there is not one Evidence that comes up
to it: and as to the former, the Consultations, whether there be
sufficient Evidence that comes up to that, is very much a Question   #
with
us: but we say, with Submission, there are not two Witnesses in that
case; for Mr. (^Porter^) says only what he was told by Sir (^George  #
Barclay^) ,
that Sir (^George^) proposed this Matter; but withal he tells you,   #
that
when Sir (^George Barclay^) proposed it, and Mr. (^Rookwood^) was    #
inform'd
what the Design was, he was so far from Conspiring, Consulting, or
Agreeing to do it, that he said it was a barbarous Act, and he       #
recoil'd
at it. Then at last says Sir (^George Barclay^) , You must command a #
Party.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Well, and what said (^Rookwood^) then?
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] (^Porter^) says, he then said, There's an   #
End of it. Now,
my Lord, what Evidence is this of a Consultation and Agreement?
<P 59>
and this is all that (^Porter^) says. As to what Mr. (^Harris^)      #
says, we are to
consider whether the List given to him be an Overt-Act; and there 
the Point in question is, whether that List can be given in Evidence
against Mr. (^Rookwood^) , upon this late Act of Parliament, as an   #
Overt-Act,
it not being laid in the Indictment? There is indeed an Overt-Act of a
List laid in the Indictment, as given to (^Cranburne^) , but none as #
given to
Mr. (^Rookwood^) .
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Pray take the Evidence right: First, What #
will you
make an Overt-Act? What do you think when there is a Debate
among divers Persons about killing the King?
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] With Submission that will be no Overt-Act #
if there
be a Debate of such a matter, tho he be present.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Aye; but when there is a Consult, and     #
upon Debate
a Resolution is formed, and tho he does at first dislike it, yet     #
when he is
told he must command a Party, he says he is content, or there's an end
of it; What do you make of that?
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] He said he did not like it, it was a      #
barbarous
desperate Design.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] It's true [^SOURCE TEXT: trne^] , but     #
when Sir (^George Barclay^) said he shou'd
command a Party, he acquiesced, and said there was an end of it: there
was a Discourse about cutting off the King, and that was agreed upon
in the Company at that time; and tho at first he did not like it,    #
yet he
might afterwards agree to it.
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] My Lord, that is it which we deny; we say #
there
is no proof of his Agreement to it.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Capt. (^Porter^) says, he did declare     #
that he said he
look'd upon it as a desperate Design, and was averse from being      #
engag'd
in it, but afterwards did agree to it; Whether that is not such an
Overt-Act as is laid in the Indictment?
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] My Lord, We must beg leave for the        #
Prisoner in a
Case of this Nature, that it may be recollected what the Evidence did
say. Mr. (^Porter^) did not take upon him to affirm that Mr.         #
(^Rookwood^)
consented to it, but only said there was an end of it: Now we must
leave that to the Jury, what they can make of such a Doubtful
Expression.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Call Mr. (^Porter^) in again.
   [$Mr. (^Conyers.^) $] My Lord, the first Meeting Mr. (^Porter^)   #
speaks of,
where the Prisoner Mr. (^Rookwood^) was, is at the                   #
(^Globe-Tavern^) , where
this Discourse was; the next Meeting that he speaks of, was on the
Friday Night, before the first Saturday when the Business            #
[^SOURCE TEXT: Busiuess^] was to be
done, and afterwards he met at (^Porter's^) Lodgings, on Saturday
Morning, in (^Ryder street^) .
[$ (^Then Capt.^) Porter (^come in again^) .$]
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Hark ye Mr. (^Porter^) , the first time   #
that this Matter
was proposed, when Mr. (^Rookwood^) was present, you say was at the
(^Globe-Tavern^) .
   [$Capt. (^Porter.^) $] Yes, my Lord, it was.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] And you say he dislik'd it, and did not   #
care to be
concern'd in it.
   [$Capt. (^Porter,^) $] Yes, my Lord, he did so.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Well, What said Sir (^George Barcley^) .
[^SOURCE TEXT: (^Geoage Barcley^) ^] 
<P 60>
   [$Capt. (^Porter.^) $] Sir (^George Barcley^) said he ought to    #
obey his Orders,
for he had such a Commission for such a thing, and he drew out a
Scheme how it was to be done; and when Sir (^George Barcley^) told
Mr. (^Rookwood^) he shou'd Command his Party, he replyed in (^French^)
there's an end of it.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] This was at the (^Globe-Tavern^) , Was it #
not?
   [$Capt. (^Porter.^) $] Yes, my Lord, it was.
   [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] Pray then, Capt. (^Porter^) , let me ask    #
you another Question,
Was he afterwards with you at any other meeting, and when and where?
   [$Capt. (^Porter.^) $] He was with me upon Saturday the 15th, at my 
Lodging in (^Little Rider-street^) , where was Sir (^George          #
Barcley^) and others.
   [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] What Discourse happen'd then, I pray?
   [$Capt. (^Porter.^) $] They did there discourse the whole Matter, #
and Sir
(^George Barclay^) was not for going at that time, because there was #
so many
People that went with the King; that there wou'd not be a good
Opportunity to effect the Design: but I told him they wou'd go off   #
after
the Hunting was over, and so it was agreed upon to go on with the
Undertaking.
   [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] Pray, at that time did Mr. (^Rookwood^)     #
pretend to dislike
the Affair, or refuse to be any way at all concern'd in it?
   [$Capt. (^Porter.^) $] No, my Lord, I can't remember that he      #
spoke one word.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] VVas Mr. (^Rookwood^) there?
   [$Capt. (^Porter.^) $] Yes, there was Mr. (^Rookwood^) , Sir      #
(^George Barcley^) and
Mr. (^Durant^) .
   [$Mr (^At. Gen.^) $] And had you discourse at that time about     #
this Business?
   [$Capt. (^Porter.^) $] Yes, my Lord, there was that Objection     #
made of so
many People going with the King, and I made that Answer that I tell  #
you.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Why then, suppose at the                  #
(^Globe-Tavern^) , such an
Expression had not dropt from the Prisoner, but a Man is present
at two Consults that are held about the Death of the King, but
says nothing either at the first or second, What wou'd you make of   #
that
Case?
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] My Lord, I confess this is a Case of a very
barbarous Nature, of which I hope my Client will acquit himself: but I
think we have the Authority of Parliament on our side, that this does
not amount to a proof of Treason. It seems they lay a stress upon    #
this,
that Mr. (^Rookwood^) came to Captain (^Porter's^) Lodgings on the   #
Saturday
Morning the 15th: but then take the Case as it is; for ought that does
appear upon the Proof, he knows not upon what account the Meeting
is before-hand. I think that is the Case of my Lord (^Russel^) , upon
which the Reversal of his Attainder went, that the Evidence came
short, and that it was but Misprision; for the Evidence was, that he
was present at the supposed Declaration's reading, but said nothing at
all to it.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] But I speak of two Meetings; there was    #
but one.
   [$Sir. (^B. Shower.^) $] My Lord, I do not know whether there     #
were two
Meetings or one then: but this is the ground we go upon, there ought
to be two Witnesses: and if there be two Meetings upon such a Design,
the second may be is accidental, and it does not appear to be a      #
design'd
Meeting; and there was no Appointment of Mr. (^Rookwood^) to be there,
nor any Negotiation by way of Message or otherwise, to that purpose.
<P 61>
Is this, my Lord, an Overt-Act? Suppose a man be present at a Consult
about Treasonable Practices, and he uses words that are indifferent; #
it is
true, in the case of a Wager it amounts to an Assent, but it hardly  #
will
come to that when People meet by accident, or for they don't know    #
what.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] How is this by accident?
   [$Sir. (^B. Shower.^) $] It does not appear that it was by Design #
or Appointment.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] They were Acquaintance.
   [$Sir. (^B. Shower.^) $] He had no acquaintance with him but in   #
Sir (^George
Barclay's^) company.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] But besides, there was an express Consent #
at the
(^Globe-Tavern^) , when (^Rookwood^) said there's an end of it.
   [$Sir. (^B. Shower.^) $] That is as much as to say, I will not do #
it, I will not
go with you --
   [$ (^Mr. Soll. Gen.^) $] Sir (^George Barclay^) was the Person    #
whom they were to 
obey; and (^Harris^) tells you, he told them what they were to do,   #
and six
Horses were first plac'd, and three of them afterwards remov'd.
   [$Sir. (^B. Shower.^) $] That won't affect him what Sir (^George  #
Barclay^) said, any
more than (^Lewis's^) appointing of the Horses.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Then there is another thing, Why did he   #
give a List to
Mr. (^Harris^) ? the List that was given had Mr. (^Rookwood's^) Name #
at top,
as he was to command the Party, and there was (^Harris's^) Name and  #
(^Hare's^) 
Name as of his Party; that is, their feign'd Names; Mr. (^Rookwood's^)
feign'd Name was (^Roberts^) that was at top, and they were to go to 
(^Turnham-Green^) , and (^Rookwood^) told (^Harris^) , he shou'd be  #
his (^Ayd du Camp^) .
   [$Sir. (^B. Shower.^) $] My Lord, for that I think we have a      #
point of Law, that
we apprehend will turn off all that Evidence, and sure we may take 
that Exception now: The words of the Act are, That no Evidence shall
be given of any Overt-Act that is not expresly laid in the           #
Indictment. Now
cannot I shew upon this Indictment, that there is no Overt-Act in    #
such a
positive direct manner as they now urge about this List. Will not that
satisfie your Lordship's Judgment to set aside all this Evidence? To #
make
the Indictment good for Treason, there ought to be a Compassing of the
Death of the King laid, and an Overt-Act laid declaring that
Compassing; but no Evidence is to be given of any Overt-Act that is  #
not laid in
the Indictment.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] You are not to take Exceptions to the     #
Indictment now, 
but only to the Evidence.
   [$Sir. (^B. Shower.^) $] I have this one Exception more; there is #
never a
(^ (\Quodque\) ^) nor a (^ (\Juratores ulterius presentant\) ^) .
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] There does not need; but that is a Fault, #
if any, in
the Indictment, and is not to be stirr'd now.
   [$Sir. (^B. Shower.^) $] If there be not a Presentment by the     #
Jury, then there
is no Overt-Act alledg'd: and if there be no Overt-Act alledged, or no
such Overt-Act, then we are within the Words of the Act, that no
Evidence shall be given of any such Overt-Act but what is alledg'd;  #
and it
is, if not expresly alledged, as if it were not alledged at all: now #
here it
is very loose, (^ (\& iidem Christopherus Knightley\) ^) , and so it #
goes on with the
rest, did so and so. There is a Presentment at first, that they did
Compass and Imagine the Death of the King; and then the Indictment   #
comes
farther, and says, that 40 men shou'd do this Business, and of those #
40
these 4 shou'd be some; and then the (^ (\iidem\) ^) bought Horses   #
and Arms, and
so it must go to the last Antecedent, and then there is no express
<P 62>
alledging of any Overt-Act, and then it is as if no Overt-Act at all #
was alledg'd.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] This Exception is not to the Evidence,    #
but to the
Indictment: it begins, (^ (\Juratores presentant quod\) ^) ; Does    #
not that relate to all?
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] No, my Lord; and I can tell you a Reason  #
why not: if
it be not so well alledged as it shou'd be, it is in an Indictment   #
as if it
were never alledged at all: and so within the Words of the Act of
Parliament this is not an Overt-Act alledg'd, and therefore they     #
cannot give
Evidence upon it.
   [$ (^Mr. Soll. Gen.^) $] Truly, my Lord, I can't imagine what     #
they are doing,
they are moving in Arrest of Judgment before a Verdict given: they say
the Overt-Act is not expresly laid; Is that an Exception to the      #
Evidence
or to the Indictment?
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] If my Lord will please to give us the     #
Liberty, we wou'd
shew there can be no Verdict given upon this Indictment.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Certainly this is an irregular            #
Proceeding; this is not
a time of Exception to the Judgment.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] Then, my Lord, we are in your Judgment, as  #
to the
Proof that has been given: If a man be present at a meeting of several
Persons, and there is a Treasonable Debate about Killing the King,   #
and this
man is only present, but neither assents, nor makes the Proposal how #
it
shall be done, whether the bare being silent, and saying nothing, is #
such
an Overt-Act as shall Convict a man of Treason?
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] I tell you, Consenting to a Traiterous    #
Design is an
Overt-Act of High-Treason, if that Consent be made to appear by good
Proof: Now the Question is, What is a good Proof and Evidence of this
Consent? a man is two or three times at a Treasonable Consult for
Killing the King, and tho perhaps at the first he did not, yet at    #
the second
he did know that the Meeting was for such a Design, (suppose for the
purpose there was but two Meetings) and at the second it is determined
to go on with the Design; Is not that an Overt-Act, tho it cannot be
proved that the Prisoner said any thing?
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] If the first Meeting is not a Consent, or   #
an Overt-Act,
neither will a second or third be if there was no more done than at  #
the first,
but they are like so many Cyphers without a Figure.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] The first Meeting possibly might be       #
accidental, he might
not know what it was for, tho that will go a great way if he does not
dissent or discover; but then he meets again with the same Company
knowing what they had in Design, Does not that prove a Consent? That
was the Case of Sir (^Everard Digby^) in the Powder-Plot.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] But where it may be uncertain, my Lord,     #
whether it
were with a good Design or a bad Design that he met with that Company,
it ought to be taken most favourably for the Prisoner: this man      #
might be
present in order to a Discovery.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] But besides, that is not this Case: you   #
are mooting
upon Points that are not in the Case. When Mr. (^Harris^) came to Mr. 
(^Rookwood^) , and finding them in some Disorder, and being          #
inquisitive what
was the Occasion, he was sent to (^Counter^) ; and when he           #
discovered what
they were to go about, he afterwards meeting Mr. (^Rookwood^) , says #
to him,
Are we sent over to murder the Prince of (^Orange^) ? says           #
(^Rookwood^) , If I
had known of this Design before I came from (^France^) , I wou'd     #
have begg'd
the King's, that is, King (^James^) , Pardon, and desired to have been
excused. Hereby he expresses his Knowledge of the Design, and what he
was to do; and tho he disliked, yet wou'd obey Orders.
<P 63>
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] There is no doubt, my Lord, but he knew of  #
it; but 
whether your Lordship will construe his Silence as a Consent, in     #
Treason, is
the Question. 
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] A man is at frequent Consults about       #
Killing the King,
and does not reveal it, it is a great Evidence of his Consent.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] But it is not prov'd that he did actually   #
Consent to it.
   [$ (^Mr. Soll. Gen.^) $] My Lord, we must submit it to your       #
Lordship, 
whether this is not totally improper and irregular at this time;     #
they are
arguing how far the Evidence is to be believ'd, before the time proper
for such an Argument comes. 
   [$ (^Mr. At. Gen.^) $] If they will call their Witnesses, let     #
them; or if they say
they have none, then they may make their Observations upon the       #
Evidence;
but else we desire we may be kept to the usual method of Proceedings.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] With Submission, we thought it fit to know  #
the Opinion
of the Court first, if there be two Witnesses against the Prisoners; #
for if
there be not two Witnesses, as the Law requites, we need not trouble
the Court with our Evidence.
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] Then, my Lord, we must desire that the    #
Record may be
read of Captain (^Porter's^) Conviction of Manslaughter: a Man that  #
has
been guilty of doing such an Act, feloniously, maliciously, and
voluntarily, as that is sure, is not a competent Witness.
   [$ (^Cl. of Arr.^) $] It has been read already.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] I thought we had been over that Objection #
before.
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] We think it is proper for us to move it   #
now again; for
tho' it is no Objection to his being a Legal Witness, yet we hope it #
will
influence his Reputation as to his Credit; for he that has been      #
guilty of
killing a man in such a manner as the Indictment lays it, will find  #
but
little Credit, we hope, with a Jury of Countrymen. But since it has
been read, and your Lordship and the Jury have taken notice of it,
we will call some other Witnesses as to Mr. (^Porter's^) Reputation  #
and
Behaviour, we think they will prove things as bad as an Attainder. I #
shall
not open them to your Lordship, but beg leave to call our Witnesses, #
who
will acquaint you what they have to say,
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Certainly, my Lord, you will not think    #
fit to let them
do so. I desire they wou'd not usher in any thing of Evidence without
acquainting the Court what they call them for: for that were the way
to let them in to call Witnesses to things that are not proper.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] Nay, without doubt, it is not regular to  #
produce any
Evidence, without opening it.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] For if it be for any Crime that a man may #
be presented
for, and there is no Conviction, I think that ought not to be given in
Evidence to take away a Witness's Credit; if it be only to his general
Reputation and Behaviour, so far they may go, and we can't oppose it.
Therefore I desire Sir (^Bartholomew Shower^) will open to the Court #
of what
nature his Evidence is.
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] Well, I will tell you then what I call    #
them to.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] You must tell us what you call them to.
   [$Sir (^B. Shower.^) $] Why then, my Lord, if Robbing upon the    #
Highway,
if Clipping, if Conversing with Clippers, if Fornication, if         #
Buggery, if
any of these Irregularities, will take off the Credit of a man, I have
Instructions in my Brief of Evidence, of Crimes of this nature, and  #
to this
purpose, against Mr. (^Porter^) ; and we hope that by Law, a Prisoner
<P 64>
standing for his Life is at liberty to give an Account of the        #
Actions and
Behaviour of the Witnesses against him. I know the Objection that Mr.
(^Attorney^) makes, a Witness does not come prepared to vindicate    #
and give an
account of every Action of his Life, and it is not commonly allowed to
give Evidence of particular Actions; but if those Actions be repeated,
and a man lives in the Practice of them, and this Practice is        #
continued for
several Years, and this be made out by Evidence; we hope no Jury that
have any Conscience, will upon their Oaths give any Credit to the
Evidence of a Person against whom such a Testimony is given.
   [$Mr. (^Phipps.^) $] We are speaking only, my Lord, to the Credit #
of Mr.
(^Porter^) , and if we can shew by Evidence that he is so Ill a Man  #
as to be guilty [^SOURCE TEXT: gulty^]
of those Crimes that we have open'd, according to the Instructions   #
in our
Brief; we hope the Jury will not think him fit to be a good Evidence
against us in this Matter.
   [$L. C. J. (^Holt.^) $] What say you to this, Mr. Attorney.
   [$Mr. (^At. Gen.^) $] My Lord, they themselves know that this     #
sort of
Evidence never was admitted in any Case, nor can be, for it must     #
tend to the
Overthrow of all Justice and Legal Proceedings; for instead of       #
trying the
Prisoner at the Bar, they wou'd try Mr. (^Porter^) . It has been     #
always
deny'd where it comes to a particular Crime that a Man may be
prosecuted for, and this it seems is not one Crime or two, but so    #
many and so
long continued as they say, and so often practised that here are the #
whole
Actions of a man's Life to be ript up, which they can never shew any
President when it was permitted, because a man has no Opportunity to
defend himself; any man in the World may by this means be wounded in #
his
Reputation, and Crimes laid to his Charge that he never thought of,  #
and
he can have no Opportunity of giving an Answer to it, because he never
imagined there wou'd be any such Objection: It is killing a man in his
good Name by a Side-wound, against which he has no Protection or
Defence. My Lord, this must tend to the preventing all manner of     #
Justice;
it is against all common Sense or Reason; and it never was offered at
by any Lawyer before, as I believe, at leastwise never so openly, and
therefore I wonder that these Gentlemen shou'd do it, who acknowledge,
at least one of them did, that as often as it has been offered it    #
has been
over-ruled; and I know not for what end it is now offered, but to make
a noise in the Court: they know that it is irregular as much as any  #
thing
that cou'd be offered.
   [$ (^Mr. Soll Gen.^) $] Indeed, my Lord, if the Prisoner at the   #
Bar had offered
this matter it had been excusable; but that Gentlemen of the Long    #
Robe,
and who are so well acquainted with the Practice of the Courts of Law,
shou'd pretend to do such a thing, is unaccountable. There was
somewhat like this that was offered at (^Manchester^) , but that was #
by the
Prisoner, to prove that one (^Lunt^) who was a Witness had two       #
Wives, and they
brought a Copy of an Indictment upon which there was no Process; after
that they endeavoured to prove him guilty of several Robberies: but  #
all
that sort of Evidence was refus'd. I only give them this Instance to
shew, that where the Prisoner has attempted it, it has been always
rejected: and I am sure they cannot shew me that ever it was allow'd #
even
to the Prisoner himself to give any thing of this kind in Evidence;  #
and
this I must say, they can never shew me any one particular Instance  #
when
Counsel ever endeavoured to do it before this time.
<P 65>
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] My Lord, I mentioned the particular      #
Crimes, the
Faults which I had in my Instructions to object against the Credit   #
of the
Testimony of Captain (^Porter^) in Answer to Mr. Attorney's desire,  #
that I
would open the particulars of the Evidence, that I would call my
Witnesses to the truth of it; I was loth to repeat the words, I      #
think the
things themselves so abominable, but we conceive with submission, we #
may
be admitted in this case to offer what we have offered. Suppose a    #
man be a
common Lewd disorderly fellow, one that frequently Swears to falshood
for his life: We know it is a common Rule in point of Evidence, that
against a Witness you shall only give an account of his Character at
large, of his general Conversation; but that general Conversation    #
arises
from particular Actions, and if the Witnesses give you an account of #
such
disorderly Actions repeated, we hope that will go to his Discredit,  #
which
is that we now are labouring for, and submit it to your Lordships
opinion whether we may not do it.

   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] Look ye, you may bring Witnesses to give an #
account
of the General Tenour of his Conversation, but you don't think sure
that we will try now at this time, whether he be guilty of Robbery or
Buggery.

   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] My Lord, we will give you an account     #
that he us'd to
have a private Lodging, and come in with his Horse tir'd and several
other such things, as that he us'd to go out in Disguises, and the   #
like.

   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] My Lord, I cannot imagine why a man that    #
has been
Guilty of any such Crimes and is not taken should be of greater Credit
then a man that has been taken and punish'd.

   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] What is that you say, Mr. (^Phipps^) ?

   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] My Lord, I say 'tis the Crime that renders  #
a Man
infamous, and I do not know why a man that has had the good fortune  #
not
to be taken and punish'd for great Crimes by him committed, should be
in a better Condition as to the Credit of his Testimony, then one    #
that is
taken and undergoes the punishment of the Law.

   [$ (^Mr. Sol. Gen.^) $] Mr. (^Chernock^) urg'd that as far as it  #
wou'd go, but we
are oblig'd it seems, to hear things that have been Over-ruled over  #
and
over; but I desire to know of them, whether they can show he has been
Guilty of a greater Crime than he has confest himself Guilty of in   #
Court.
I mean of the intended Assassination.

   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] No we agree we can't, but pray let us prove #
him Guilty
of as many Crimes as we can.

   [$ (^Mr. Sol. Gen.^) $] But, my Lord, I hope you'l keep them to   #
the general
Question of the Common ordinary Tenour of his Conversation.
    [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] Call Mr. (^Oldfield^) , Mr.             #
(^Nichols^) , Mr. (^Milford^) , (^Black Will^) .
[$ (^ (Mr. Milford^) appeared.) $]
<P 66>
   [$ (^Cryer.^) $] Lay your hand on the Book. The Evidence that you #
shall give
on behalf of the Prisoner at the Bar, shall be the Truth, the whole  #
Truth,
and nothing but the Truth, So help you God.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] Pray will you give my Lord and the Jury  #
an account
whether you know Capt. (^Porter^) and how long you have known him.
   [$ (^Milford.^) $] I have known him about 4 year.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] What Reputation is he off?
   [$ (^Milford.^) $] I never knew any hurt by him in my life.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] Pray what is your name?
   [$ (^Milford.^) $] Frederick Milford.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] But the name in my Brief is (^John       #
Milford^) , that is my
man.
   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] But you see this man knows him.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] Call (^Mr. Oldfield^) .
[$ (^ (Which was done, and he appeared accordingly.^) $] 
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] Do you know Capt. (^Porter^) .
   [$ (^Oldfield.^) $] Yes I do.
   [$ (^Mr Phipps.^) $] How long have you known him?
   [$ (^Oldfield.^) $] I believe about twenty Years.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] Pray will you give my Lord and the Jury an  #
account of
his Life and Conversation.
   [$ (^Oldfield.^) $] I can say nothing, he was always Civil in my  #
Company, but
he was Lewd in his Discourse.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] What do you mean by being Lewd in his    #
Discourse?
   [$ (^Oldfield.^) $] Why he wou'd be talking very extravagantly.
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] What do you mean in talking, was it of what #
he had
done himself, Sir?
   [$ (^Oldfield.^) $] No otherwise then that he had Whor'd and      #
those kind of
things.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] What other things beside Whoring?
   [$ (^Oldfield.^) $] I Know no other part of it.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] Where is (^Edward Bowcher^) ?
[$ (^ (He did not appear.^) $]
   [$ (^Mr. Phipps.^) $] Call (^William O Bryan^) .
[$ (^ (He did not appear.^) $]
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] Where is (^Mr. Page^) and (^Mr.          #
Hardiman^) ?
[$ (^ (None of them appeared.^) $]
   [$ (^Cryer.^) $] There is not a man of them here, Sir.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] (^Mr. Webber^) , Do you know where they  #
are for the Court
stays for them.
   [$ (^Mr. Webber.^) $] Indeed I do not, they were summon'd to be   #
hear.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] Where is Black (^Will^) ?
   [$ (^Cryer.^) $] Black (^Will^) .
[$ (^ (He appeared and was a Moor.^) $]
   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] Ask him if he be a Christian.
   [$ (^Cryer.^) $] I have ask'd him, and he says he's a Christian.
Sworn. [$ (^ (Then he was sworn.^) $]
   [$ (^L. C. J. H.^) $] Well what do you ask him.
   [$ (^Rookwood.^) $] (^Will^) , Pray give an account of your       #
Master, and of his
Life and Conversation.
<P 67>
   [$Mr. (^Phipps.^) $] You are sworn to tell the Truth, Sweet-heart.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] I serv'd him almost 8 Years, and he has been a    #
very good Master
to me, my Lord.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] But what do you know him to be guilty of.
   [$ (^Will.^) $] Nothing at all.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] I believe they have put in these Men to  #
confirm his
Reputation.
   [$L. C. J. (^H.^) $] Indeed, I think the King's Councel should    #
have called
these Witnesses if there had been occasion.
   [$ (^Sir B. Shower.^) $] We submit it to your Direction, how far  #
this Evidence
will affect him there is nothing said, as we apprehend that will     #
amount to
Treason: If the Prisoner has a mind to say any thing himself, we     #
hope your
Lordship will please to hear him.
   [$L. C. J. (^H.^) $] Ay, if he will, let him.
   [$ (^Rookwood.^) $] My Lord, Mr. (^Porter^) does not say, that I  #
consented to
Command any Party.
   [$L. C. J. (^H.^) $] Is that all you have to say? Then,           #
Gentlemen, will you
sum up.
   [$Mr. (^Conyers.^) $] My Lord, we are agreed, we submit to the    #
Court on both
sides.
