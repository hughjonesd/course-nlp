[^GERARDO ASKS THE COUNT WHETHER MONTANO IS IN LOVE.^]
[^...^] That indeed is his
unhappy circumstance [$ ( (^reply'd the^)
Count) $] and that with a very coy and
unkind Nymph, that's deaf to all his
Prayers, and, tho of the Play-House,
will not be won by (^Money^) , nor (^Youth^) .
That's a Miracle indeed [$ ( (^return'd^)
Gerardo) $] but pray, who is this invincible
(^Amazon^) , that will not yield to
my Friend (^Montano^) ? (^Bracilla^) [$ (reply'd
the (^Count^) ) $] who in my opinion hath
hath nothing taking but her Youth,
and affected Coyness. That Coyness
[$ (said (^Gerardo^) ) $] I can tell you the cause
of, which though it be not due to her
Vertue, is at least to her Constancy in
Love, (^Monfredo^) having taken Possession
of her heart, if report and my own
observations fail me not. Prithee, thou
art such a living Libel [$ (reply'd the
(^Count^) ) $] that like (^Medly^) in Sir (^Forpling
Flutter^) , no Woman thou knowest, escapes
thee, of how great quality soever, much
less an (^Actress^) , whose Reputation, as
well as Person is exposed for the
Pleasure, and Diversion of the Audience.
<P 11>
   'Tis too true [$ (interrupted (^Montano^) ) $]
I have long since found the cause of all
my unhappiness in that successful Rival
(^Monfredo^) . She has indeed [$ (pursued the
(^Count^) ) $] been more severe to you of late
than formerly, for I remember at first
she heard your Address with more
pleasure, than pain. True [$ (answered
(^Montano^) ) $] I well remember the happy time,
the joy of which is not yet effac'd with
all her after Cruelty.
   But thou art ignorant [$ ( (^continu'd
he^) ) $] (^Gerardo^) of the progress of my Love,
I'll therefore repeat it from the
beginning, with all its most material [^SOURCE TEXT: meterial^]
circumstances, that you may the better advise
me. Do so [$ ( (^reply'd^) Gerardo) $] poor
(^Lover^) , and I'll give thee the best
Advice that I'm able, and I warrant I
either cure, or satisfie thy Passion, if I
have any skill in the Mathematicks. But
pray proceed.
[^MONTANO'S SPEECH: HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH BRACILLA WHEN SHE IS ACTING
IN A PLAY. THE COUNT AND MONTANO DRINK HEAVILY AFTERWARDS BUT MONTANO
GOES BACK TO THE THEATRE THE NEXT NIGHT WHERE BRACILLA PLAYS THE PART
OF A YOUNG LOVER -- HIS SPEECH CONTINUES:^]
<P 13>
   Being behind the Scenes, the first
opportunity I had -- Madam ( (^said I^) )
you act the Lover to a Miracle, and it
became you so wonderfully, that I vow
'tis a thousand pities but you shou'd
be one in reality. I'm not at all oblig'd
to you, Sir, ( (^reply'd she^) ) for your wish,
in such an inconstant Interess'd Age
as this is, since it must only contribute
to my certain ruine. Why, Madam,
( (^said I^) ) did you never Love? What
makes you ask that familiar question
( (^return'd she something angry, and leaving
me, pursu'd^) ) whether I have or no, I shall
never Love you I'm sure. The
Heavens forbid ( (^reply'd I, and follow'd her^) )
But pardon me, Madam, I design'd not
to affront you by that demand, because
I thought it impossible so much of it
shou'd appear in your bare
personating a Lover, with an absolute
insensibility within, and that you shou'd be
so every way compleated for Love, and
yet be without that Blessing of Humane
Life. Sir, ( (^said she^) ) if you think this
Discourse pleases me, I shall leave you
to convince you that it does not.
Not so, I beseech you, Madam,
<P 14>
( (^answer'd I^) ) rather than lose the
Happiness of your Conversation, I'll curb
my forward Heart, that is unwilling
to let me talk of any thing but its
wounds. Alas! poor Gentleman
( (^replyes she, and smil'd^) ) then you are in
Love it seems, and out of pure spite
to those that are not so, you endeavour
to spread the infection you have caught,
or like some troublesome People at a
Feast, will needs thrust the Dish you
esteem upon every one, never
considering that another may hate it. Nay,
you Lovers, are still as impertinent,
as they, for neither of you will take
any denyal, which methinks is
something troublesome, as well as uncivil.
But pray, Sir, ( (^pursu'd she, without
giving me any time to answer^) ) what Fair
Lady has undone you? None of us I
dare swear, for then you wou'd not
lose your time with me, which you
might employ to bend her stubborn
Heart. But perhaps, you are a happy
Lover, and so can borrow some time
from your Mistress, to make
Proselytes. If so, ( (^concluded she^) ) 'tis pity
you shou'd fling it away, and a
thousand fine sayings to boot on me, since I
vow, Sir, I'm as deaf to that, as the
People to Virtue in distress.
<P 15>
   She staid not to hear me, but ran
to t'other side of the Stage, and before
I cou'd overtake her, was Enter'd. I
was extreamly pleas'd with her
Discourse, and was impatient till the end
of the Act, that I might attack her
once more, if it were only to have
the satisfaction of talking to her.
   But, Madam, ( (^said I^) ) but are you
indeed so very irreconcilable an Enemy
to Love? Why, Sir, ( (^reply'd she^) )
shou'd you doubt it? Do you expect to
find that on the Stage? We represent
too many of its follies to be guilty of
them our selves. You shou'd go to
some Country Village, where perhaps
you may find some believing
Romantick Virgin, that may gratifie your
Curiosity, but you are much mistaken
if you think it the growth of the
Theatre -- Gad the Girl spoke a
profound Truth [$ ( (^interrupted^) Gerardo) $] in
that, for the Devil a bit of Love did I
ever know there out of their parts,
unless when Money made 'em Act that
in their own Persons, which they did
for the same represent in anothers. But
pray proceed --
   Ah, Madam, ( (^said I^) , [$ (^continu'd^)
Montano) $] banish not the Thoughts of
<P 16>
Love from any place where you abide,
for there must still be (^Lovers^) . Besides,
'tis ingrateful to the little God to
flight him, who was the cause of your
Being. For my part ( (^continu'd I^) )
I shall cherish it, since my self, and
all the rest of Mankind, as well as
you, owe our Life and Being to it. I 
shall never grant that, ( (^return'd she^) )
unless you can prove, that ev'ry Man and
Wife Love one another. Doubtless,
Madam, ( (^answer'd I^) ) the most
disagreeing Couple have their intervals of
Dearness. Dearness, ( (^said she^) )
Madness you mean -- but for Heaven's
sake, Sir, no more of this Discourse,
since 'tis very much my aversion. Ah,
Madam, ( (^reply'd I^) ) what can be more
proper to talk of to the most Charming
of her Sex, than of Love. Love
( (^answer'd she^) ) ought not to be mention'd in
sober Company, the very symptoms of
it confess the Fool, and Mad-man, a
thousand antick postures, extravagant
sayings, and wishes, as well as
preposterous ways, to gain what it
pretends to, therefore no more of Love,
as you value your Reputation. [^...^]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 33>
[^MONTANO ASKS FOR ADVICE REGARDING HIS LOVE PROBLEMS.^]
   First, [$ (reply'd (^Gerardo^) ) $] 'Gad I'm
extreamly sorry that in your first
Amour you shou'd not only meet with
so many Obstacles, but should take such
ill Methods in the Prosecution of it;
for the Conduct of your Passion shews
that you took wrong measures all along.
   'Tis you therefore, [$ ( (^said the Count^) ) $]
that must put him in the right path,
from which his unexperienc'd Youth
has made him deviate.
   That shall be my task, my Lord,
[$ ( (^reply'd^) Gerardo) $] tho' 'tis now a more
desperate case, than if right measures
had been taken at first. Alas,
[$ ( (^interrupted^) Montano) $] I hope what's past, has
not render'd the Disease incurable?
<P 34>
No, no, [$ ( (^reply'd^) Gerardo) $] have a
little Courage, the Fair as well as Towns
are won, by assurance and constancy.
I wou'd therefore desire both you and
my Lord, to lay aside all this great
trouble that possesses you.
   As for me, [$ ( (^said the^) Count) $] the
only care and trouble that affects me
in this Affair, is the grief of my
Friend, who was continually possess'd
with all the Ravings of a Man, that
wholly gave up himself to Love. He's
deaf to all that I can urge, and Reason;
brings him no relief. Ah, my Lord,
[$ ( (^reply'd^) Montano) $] he that pretends to
be a Lover, and at the same time to be
govern'd by Reason, is but a Hypocrite.
   Why is Love then [$ ( (^said the^) Count) $]
so irreconcilable an Enemy to Reason,
that it can never cohabit with it?
Oh! without doubt [$ (reply'd (^Gerardo^) ) $]
they are at mortal odds, for Reason
in all things prefers a (^medium^) as the
surest basis of all (^Certainty^) and (^Good^) , but
a (^mean^) in (^Love^) is as odious as in
Poetry. Right, [$ (assum'd (^Montano^) ,$] for
'tis but indifference disguis'd in
another word, and what is so
contradictory in Nature, as an (^unconcern'd^) and
(^indifferent^) Lover? True, [$ ( (^pursu'd^)
<P 35>
Gerardo) $] for indifference banishes
Desire, and he that's once free from 
Desire, is no longer in the number of the
(^Loving^) ; for (^Love^) , is nothing but an
unsatisfi'd desir'd Union, and
becoming, as much as Nature will allow,
one with the Object we admire. I
find, [$ ( (^reply'd^) Montano (^with some
satisfaction^) ) $] that you (^Gerardo^) have known
what Love is, since you give so very
good an account of its Nature, for
tho' we cannot all be like (^Salmacs^)
transform'd, or as I may better say,
swallow'd up into the very same Being with
our Mistress, yet certainly no Lover, if
he Lov'd as I do, but wou'd desire a
perpetual Union, and ne'er be parted
from, but eternally be cleaving to the
fair (^one he adores^) . --
   But if you once grant [$ ( (^interrupted the^)
Count) $] that (^Love^) is so very great a
Foe to (^Reason^) , you must give one leave
to infer, that the first can't be
admitted without the abdication of the
latter, and if so, (abstracting from the
case of my Friend) all the pity he
deserves, that gives himself up to that
Passion, is a Slabb'ring Bib, or (^Bedlam^) ,
since he must be either a Fool, or a
Madman, or a perfect (^Brute^) , Reason
<P 36>
being the only distinction betwixt Man
and Beast; for I can't think, either the
substance and form of Humane Kind,
essentially different from that of Brutes.
My Lord, [$ ( (^said^) Gerardo) $] you speak
as if (^Love^) were a voluntary Passion,
which we might either admit, or avoid
as we please, and if so, certainly what
you observ'd wou'd hold good, but it
being wholly involuntary, and a Power that
we can't resist, I presume the unhappy
Patient, merits as much pity, as those,
whom Fortune or Distempers renders
miserable. Be that as 'twill [$ ( (^answer'd
the^) Count) $] if indifference be a fault
in (^Love^) , I'm sure all beyond
moderation is distraction, and which, I thank
my Stars, I never yet was subject to.
Your Lordship, [$ ( (^reply'd^) Gerardo) $] is too
wise for your Age, for whatever the
fancy'd Happiness of extravagant (^Love^)
may be to such Lovers, I'm perswaded
the moderate Lover meets with as
much in reality upon Tryal. And for
my part, I can say this for my self,
[$ ( (^continu'd he^) ) $] that my Passion never rose
above an (^Amouret^) in my Life.

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 38>
[^MONTANO'S FRIENDS CONTINUE TO ADVISE HIM:^]
   Thou wer't a Lover for my Mony
[$ ( (^said the^) Count) $] and didst know how to
extract Pleasure out of all
circumstances, which is the best sort of
Chymistry. And I wish my poor Amorous
Friend here, cou'd follow this
Example; but he does not only vex and
<P 39>
torment himself to no end or purpose, but
by banishing Reason, as an Enemy to
his Love, depriving me of all
remedies of his Distemper, in either
extinguishing, or satisfying his Passion.
   So much the unhappier I [$ ( (^reply'd^)
Montano) $] who am depriv'd of all means of
obtaining (^Bracilla^) , tho her Embraces
alone can cure my tortur'd Soul.
   You blindly keep your self in an
Error [$ ( (^said^) Gerardo) $] by perswading
your self, that there is no way of
obtaining her, because by taking the
wrong, you have hitherto been
unsuccessful. Follow but my instructions,
and if thou dost not gain her without
the expence of another sigh, then I'll
quit all my pretences to intrigue, and
subscribe my self a most egregious
Blockhead.
   Gad, and if thy Counsel [$ ( (^said the^)
Count) $] be successful (for that's the
Test of all Excellence you know in our
Age) thou shalt be receiv'd as Grand
Master of the new Order of Knights of
(^Intrigue^) . I'm sure I shall value him
[$ ( (^pursued^) Montano (^very seriously, and
sigh'd^) ) $] as my deliverer as long as I
live; and I'm Impatient to hear him;
therefore pray proceed.
[^LONG SPEECH OMITTED.^]

<S SAMPLE 4>
<P 42>
[^GERARDO AND THE COUNT DEBATE COURTING WITH MONEY:^]
   For my part [$ ( (^said the^) Count) $] I
highly approve of your Counsel, and
think you have prescribed the surest
and most easie way of Happiness to
<P 43>
my Friend, and I wish he were in
an humour of putting it straight
into execution. Nay, if he be so
Wedded [$ ( (^replied^) Gerardo) $] to the Virtue
of his Mistress, and his own Torments,
that he'll not take wholsome advice,
I've done with him, and give him
o're for lost; for believe me, a
modest and humble Passion will
succeed with no Woman, much less with
an Actress, that by her Profession
denies all notions of bashfulness.
Women in general, and those in
particular, stoop only to the forward and
the bold, or else to all Charming,
Witty, Eloquent Gold.
   Alas! [$ ( (^said^) Montano) $] I'de give all
I'm worth to possess (^Bracilla^) ,
especially by her own consent, but I fancy
you are mistaken in her, she's
exempt from that Mercenary Devil's
Jurisdiction that guide the rest of the
Females of the Stage. As much as she
is exempt [$ ( (^replied the^) Count) $] from
Love and Intrigue, since you see, tho'
she be so deaf to you, she can caress
the worn-out Carcass of (^Monfredo^) ,
in the worst capacity. Nay, my
dear Lord, [$ ( (^answered^) Montano) $]
mistake not, I am very willing to try all
<P 44>
means to satisfie my eager longing,
and 'twas only my fear suggested
what I said, having hitherto been so
unfortunate in my Addresses to her.
But let us put this Advice in
Execution [^SOURCE TEXT: Exe- tion AT LINE BREAK^] as soon as        #
possible.
   'Tis now [$ ( (^said^) Gerardo) $] I believe,
about the end of the fifth Act of
the Play, and if you design any thing
to night with (^Coromella^) , you must get
in before the Play be done. I'll send
my Man in [$ ( (^replied the^) Count) $] to fetch
her hither to us. No, no, you are
out, my Lord, [$ ( (^said^) Gerardo) $] for
she's a Bawd of better Quality, than
to be at the beck of a Footman.
Therefore if you have no mind to
remove, I'll go to her my self, and
convey her to you immediately before
the hurry.
[^COROMELLA HAS SUPPER WITH THE MEN WHEREAFTER THEY TELL HER ABOUT
MONTANO'S PREDICAMENT.^]
<P 45>
   Alas! poor Gentleman [$ ( (^said she^) ) $]
is this young Cupid that doats on our
coy (^Psyche^) [^SOURCE TEXT: Psyhe^] ? I am the unhappy Wretch
[$ ( (^replied^) Montano) $] that dies for the
Possession of (^Bracilla^) ; which I have in
vain pursued this Twelve-Month, and
must despair of, unless you can give
me any hope. Hope! [$ ( (^assumed^)
<P 46>
Gerardo) $] hope is almost as great a
crime in those that confide in
the exquisite (^Coromella^) , as despair;
for it lessens her Reputation: You
may be sure, infallibly certain of
success, if she say the word.
   Then on her saying that word
[$ ( (^replied^) Montano) $] depends all my 
happiness. But there is some other
preliminaries [$ ( (^interrupted the^) Count) $] to
be adjusted before she passes her
Parole in this case. My Lord has
reason [$ ( (^pursued^) Gerardo) $] for (^any
Labourer is worthy his hire^) . I think her so
worthy of hers [$ ( (^replied^) Montano) $] that
she shall be her own Carver. Well,
Sir, [$ ( (^said^) Coromella) $] as our
Profession is more natural than that of a
Lawyer, so are we more generous;
for till I have made you happy, I'll
have no (^Fee^) , and then -- And then
[$ ( (^interrupted^) Montano) $] thou shalt
command my all -- Then, Sir, you shall
be your own Carver [$ ( (^pursued^)
Coromella) $] for 'tis a thousand pities that
such a pretty young Gentleman as you
should languish in vain, for whom a
hundred Virgins die; some, to my
knowledge, wou'd purchase your
Embraces, at as high a rate, as you wou'd
<P 47>
those of the ill natur'd (^Bracilla^) . As
ill-natur'd as she is [$ ( (^assum'd the^) Count) $] I
hope you can now mold her, and make
her face so us'd to frowns put on a more
acceptable form, and bless my Amorous
Friend with the (^ (\deux yeux\) ^) , and
wanton smiles. Never doubt me, my
Lord, [$ ( (^replied^) Coromella) $] no Man can
upbraid me with promising more, than
I perform'd, and if your Friend will
be directed by my advice, he shall not
be two nights without her in his Arms,
and then let him do with her what he
thinks fit.
[^COROMELLA SPEAKS OF MEN WHO DO FOOLISH THINGS WHEN IN LOVE:^]
<P 49>
   Prithee, thou plead'st for thy
Interest [$ ( (^interrupted^) Gerardo) $] for Men
love that Pleasure which they
purchase hardly, as Women and Fops
value things for being far fetch'd
and dear bought.

   Those are wretched Mortals
indeed [$ ( (^replied^) Coromella) $] that, like
old Letchers, place their delights in
stripes; a Man of Sense and Vigour
needs none of these provocations,
and falls too whenever the Victuals
are set before him, tho' he was not
at the pains of earning them. Gads
<P 50>
my life [$ ( (^continued she^) ) $] you'd extend
the Curse of Mankind farther than
'twas intended, by making him earn
his Pleasure, as well as Food, by
the sweat of his Brow.

   Prithee (^Gerardo^) [$ ( (^said the^) Count) $]
interrupt not the Lady, methinks
her discourse is extreamly pleasant
and reasonable. Pray, Madam,
proceed, for I assure you, you have
almost made me a Convert to the
Method you propose. But what
certainty of Success has a man, if he
put his Cause into your hands?

   That is according to the Merits
of the (^Client^) [$ ( (^replied she^) ) $] that is his
Purse or Generosity; for, Sir, we
have no Causes in (^ (\Forma Pauperis\) ^) ,
and he that has Money, and will
yet starve a good Cause, deserves to 
lose it.

   Spoken like an Oracle, by
Heaven [$ ( (^said the^) Count, (^and smil'd^) ) $] but
supposing nothing wanting of the
(^Client's^) side, what assurance has he
of Success? Infallible experience
<P 51>
[$ ( (^replied^) Coromella) $] for I defie the
World to say that the endeavours
of a Mistress in her Profession ever
fail'd. I'm sure I may, without a
lie, boast, that from the Girl of
seven to the Matron of Seventy, I
have never been foil'd to this day,
which is at least the thirtieth Year
of my Profession.

   Girls of seven [$ ( (^interrupted the^)
Count) $] why sure you deal not in
such unripe commodities? Ah! my
Lord, you lye under a very great
mistake [$ ( (^replied she^) ) $] for here as well as
in the (^Indies^) , we have some of our
Sex ripe before that age, at least in
mind, if not in body. I have known
some have Children before they
reach'd the teens, and not one in
a thousand keeps her Maidenhead
to a dozen Years of age, if
handsome. Why I my self, my Lord,
can't remember that ever I was a 
Maid, for from an Infant I dally'd
with my equals, and so proceeded
till I came to be Mans meat, else I
cou'd never have arriv'd to all the
<P 52>
Perfections in the Noble Mystery I
profess.

   'Tis indeed a Mystery, [$ ( (^said^)
Montano) $] I shou'd be glad to hear a
farther account of it, since I must
owe my happiness to't, if you,
Madam, think fit to give us that
satisfaction.

   I think I may be free here 
[$ ( (^replied she^) ) $] Mr. (^Gerardo^) knows enough
of it already, not to be scandaliz'd,
and tell tales out of School; and for
you two, one of you have an
immediate, and the other, in good time,
may have a dependance on me; to
gratifie you therefore, and to divert
you from your amorous Anxiety,
I'll tell you some part of our
Art.
[^COROMELLA'S SPEECH: HOW TO BE A BAWD OF QUALITY.^]
<P 54>
   Agents [$ ( (^interrupted the^) Count) $] why
have you your Dependants and Spies,
and under Officers? Yes, my Lord,
[$ ( (^replied she^) ) $] and that in all Dresses
<P 55>
and Degrees, at least, such as can
form themselves to any. [^...^]
[^COROMELLA CONTINUES HER SPEECH:^]
   But in these Visits to the Wives
[$ ( (^said the^) Count) $] don't the Husbands
sometimes find you out? Once or
<P 56>
twice, indeed [$ ( (^replied she^) ) $] in my life,
I inconsiderately went to speak to
the Wife of a Gentleman that had
known the Town very well, and my
Person, and Name; sending which
up, instead of the Lady, the Husband
came, and us'd me indeed, most
unmercifully, but I was reveng'd on
him; for I got her at last by other
means, and I was more cautious for
the future.

   The (^Savoy^) for that [$ ( (^interrupted^)
Gerardo) $] there I'm sure you were foil'd.
Good reason why [$ ( (^replied she^) ) $] the
Spark liv'd not long enough to
experience my Revenge, I had certainly
else paid him in the same kind I
did the other.

   But I'll tell you one of the most
difficult Tasks I ever met with, the
Narrative being pleasant, and then
Gentlemen I'll take my leave of you,
and go about the Affair of the Young
Lover here. But Sir, you must be
sure to have the Lady's price ready,
what ever you do with me. Let me
but know both, and I'll not fail
<P 57>
you [$ (reply'd (^Montano^) :) $] Alas, mine
won't exceed Five or Ten Guineas,
nor hers, I believe Fifty or a
Hundred at most: Reasonable enough in
Conscience [$ (said the (^Count^) ) :$] but
prithee to the account of the
Intrigue.

   Right, my Lord [$ (reply'd she) $] and
by it you'll find I am a Mistress in
my profession, and one you may 
entirely confide on, if your Lordship
shou'd ever have any occasion of 
me.
[^HERE BEGINS COROMELLA'S NARRATIVE OF CLELIA AND HER LOVER.^] 

<S SAMPLE 5>
<P 72>
[^COROMELLA'S NARRATIVE CONTINUES:^]
[^...^] I presented her
another Letter from the (^Count^) ,
and informed her how
Passionately he Doated on her, and that
'twas pity to make so Young, and
<P 73>
so accomplish'd a Gentleman perish in
his Youth, only because he lov'd her.
(^Alas^) ! return'd (^Clelia, 'tis not in my
power to make him less miserable if I had the
Will, nor do I know whether I have that,
unless you'll please to give me some
account of his Person; for I confess, that I
have often seen a Gentleman in the
Church, speak a thousand soft and tender
things with his Eyes, and have taken
some Pleasure in that Discovery, his
Person being every way so amiable^) . He is
( (^replyed I^) ) very young, of a middle

something in his Face extreamly like the

defer his happiness no longer than needs

what his word might do to obtain it
that Night. (^Therefore^) , said he, (^I wish

innocently submitted to her Husbands
Command, and caressed the Count with
a double kindness, since obliged to it
by the likeness he had to the Man she
lov'd, and by her Conjugal
Obedience.

Kisses. (^'Tis in vain, Divine Creature^)

[$ (interrupted Gerardo) $] (^dear^) Coromella,
(^he were a Pagan indeed, that had not
an implicit Faith in thee, without the
Confirmation thou hast given us, since the
Fame of thy Art is not so obscure as to

Attestations of the success of their skill, but thou,

<P 90>
   I think indeed [$ ( (^said Montano^) ) $] my
Case is not so desperate as that of the

Gerardo^) ) $] she has from an Infant, almost had
the Virtuous Education of the Stage,
which could not but inspire her with
the severest and most Stoical Principles
of Chastity, and against Pleasure. No,

Pleasure of an (^Actress^) is her Intrest,
and till you gratify that, you must
expect no more from her than from a
perfect (^Lucretia^) .

and I must leave you, for I'll
immediately set my Engins to work for this
sighing Lover; and promise him they
shall bring her into his Arms to
morrow Night at farthest, and so I take
my leave of you, Gentlemen,
expecting to find (^Montano^) to morrow in the

design to be happy, and you must in

of speaking aloud, unless you can
imitate her Voice, and never permit

see you by Candle light; make him
undress himself in your
Anti-chamber, and come to you in the Dark.
And be very coy till he presents you
with the price of his happiness in a
Purse of Gold. Never [$ ( (^return'd
Clelia^) ) $] will I be mercenary to the Man
I love especially. Then never must you

   You are not [$ ( (^said she softly^) ) $] a man
fit to be trusted with such Favours you

your self according to those Rules I
prescribe. Pardon me, my dear
charming (^Bracilla^) [$ ( (^replyed^) Montano) $] and
forgive the first transgression I have
done, too much transported to see these
Gloves, the dear assurance that it was
you indeed that gave me all those
happy Joys last Night, but for the future,
I'll be more cautious, and will not trust
my self so far as to venture behind
the Scenes, for fear I should commit
some other Offence; therefore my
Charming dear (^Bracilla^) , forgive this
one, this little Fault.

   Well, if you'l swear [$ ( (^replyed Clelia^) ) $]
that you'l never more come behind the
Scenes, nor speak to me in the Day

not expect you would make so good

[^MONTANO MEETS WITH HIS FRIENDS THE COUNT AND GERARDO.^]
   If Bawds begin to fail even with
Players [$ ( (^said Gerardo^) ) $] I know not what
help to give you, unless the Expedient
of a certain French Lover may do.
What is that [$ ( (^said Montano^) ) $] pray let's
have it, for perhaps it may furnish us
with some expedient or other of
Relief. Oh! a certain one [$ (^replyed
Gerardo^) ,$] but 'tis like desperate
Remedies, 'twill Kill or Cure. Prithee [$ ( (^said
Montano^) ) $] torture me not with Delays,
but begin your Account.
<P 113>
   Why then 'tis thus [$ ( (^replyed
Gerardo^) ) $] A young Gentleman at (^Paris^) was
two Years desperately in Love with a
Lady of that City; his long sufferings,
fidelity, adresses, sighs, complaints, and
all the other efforts of Love were all
unprofitable: At last being one happy
Day all alone with her in a Closet,
he declared to her, that since he had
found that there was nothing that could
touch her hard Heart with any
tenderness for him, he was now resolv'd
to dye; That till this time he had
used a Language common to all
Lovers, but that now he would speak one
peculiar to himself; (^And that you may,
Madam^) , (said he to her) (^not lose the
full satisfaction of my Death, and have
the pleasure of seeing me dye by degrees;
I will Perish by Famine, tho' in your
Closet^) . 
[^GERARDO'S NARRATIVE: A FRENCH LOVER LIES DOWN TO DIE IN 
HIS MISTRESS'S HOUSE.^]
<P 114>
   The fourth Day the Lady began to
make Reflections with her self of the
Scandal that she should incur. (^A Man
dead in my Closet^) (said she) (^dead by
Dispair! dead by Famine! Alas! I'm
undone! What a noise will this make in
the World? Which will never believe
<P 115>
the truth of the matter, but make a
thousand Scandalous Jests on the
unhappy Accident^) . She was nearly touch'd
with so considerable an Evidence of so
extraordinary a Passion; and I believe
that had as great an influence upon her
as the fear of the Scandal. After
therefore she had again endeavour'd by
perswasions to get him out of her
Closet, to no purpose; ( (^she said to him^) )
Sir, since all the good reasons I have
weyed to you, will not make you
comply with me, to hasten and forsake the
place; since I find you will rather dye
here, if you will but retire from hence
you shall possess whatever you please.
[^THE FRENCH LOVER IN GERARDO'S STORY COMES TO LIFE AGAIN.^]
<P 116>
   Now (^Montano^) [$ ( (^concluded Gerardo^) ) $]
if you can undergo this Expedient, you
may perhaps be as successful. No, no,
[$ ( (^said the Count^) ) $] the Reputation of a
Player is not strong enough to make
her yield in the same manner, for she
would rather Glory in it than be 
afraid of the Scandal. You are in an
Error, my Lord, [$ ( (^replyed Gerardo^) ) $] since
the fear of being Endicted for Murder,
would make her supply the defect of 
the love of her own Reputation.
However I would not really advise my
Friend to trye, but only if he can
get such an opportunity of being in
a Chamber alone with her, let him
employ the perswasive Rhetorick of
Gold in one hand, and manly Vigour
in the other; and I'm perswaded he
will not fail. No, no [$ ( (^said Montano^) ) $]
I know my only Bar to happiness; 
(^Monfredo^) posses her very Soul, and
her Interest and Love combining in him;
she will not run the risque of
offending him, tho' for the saving the Life
of the most loving and foolish Doater
of Mankind.
<P 117>
   That Lett methinks [$ ( (^said Gerardo^) ) $]
should be easily removed, if he be
so sawcy and insolent as they say he
is, and if he will, being the
Property of another, interlope in the free
Trade, he ought to be punished, or
put out of the way a while till you
succeed in your Wishes.
