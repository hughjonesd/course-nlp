<P C3R>
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] How the deuils are sent by the witches, and how
they doe those bodily harmes, wee are not yet come vnto,
and there lie two of the chiefe subtilties of the deuill in
them, by which he deceiueth the multitude. But by
occasion we are fallen into the mention of remedie to driue them
away. Because (I say) such as thus driue him away, know
not the spirituall battell, much lesse how to put on the whol
armour of God to ouercome the deuil: Order doth require
that we speak first of his sending, and then of those bodilie
<P C3V>
harmes which he doth, & afterward of these meanes which
are vsed to repell him. Let vs therefore step one step backe
againe, if you agree to the rest which I haue spoken.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] With a good will: for so we shall omit no part.
But I thought we had fullie agreed in this, that the
witches do send their spirits, and doe manie harmes both vnto
men and beasts: because we haue it confirmed by daylie
experience: and vnlesse you will denie that which is manifest,
I doubt not but we shall accorde in these.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I say the witches do send their spirits.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] What shal we need then to stand vpon that point
in which we are agreed?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Yes though we agree that they send them, yet
we may dissent in diuers thinges about this sending. As
first, tell me, whether doe you thinke that the witch or the
Deuill is the seruaunt, which of them commaundeth, and
which obeyeth?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] How can I tell that? It is thought hee
becommeth her seruaunt, and where she is displeased, and would
be reuenged, she hyreth him for to doe it. The witches
the~selues haue confessed thus much: and for my part, I think
no man can disprooue it.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] They that doe the will of God are the children
and seruants of God. And they which fulfill the lustes of
the deuill, and obey him, are his children & his seruantes,
(^Ioh. 8. vers. 44. Act. 13. vers. 10.^) Are they not?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I graunt all this?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] The deuilles are the rulers of the darknesse of
this world. (^Ephes. 6. ver. 12.^)
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] The text is plaine.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] The darknesse of this world, is not meant of the
darknesse of the night, which is but the shadow of the earth,
but it is the spiritual darknes, which consisteth in the
ignorance of God, in infidelitie, and in sinne.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I am of your mind in this also.
<P C4R>
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] And doe you not thinke then that the deuill hath
his throne, his dominion and kingdom in the hearts of
ignorant blind infidels?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I must needs thinke he hath, the word of God
doth force me thereunto: seeing he is the Prince of
darkenesse.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] And is there anie greater infidelitie and
darknesse in anie, than in witches, coniurers, and such as haue
familiaritie with deuils?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I tak it they be the depest ouerwhelmed in
darknesse and infidelitie of all other.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Lay all these thinges together which you
confesse, and see whether it doth not follow vpon the same, that
the witch is the vassall of the deuill, and not he her seruant;
he is Lord and commaundeth, and she is his drudge and
obeyeth.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Yea, although he be Lord, yet he is content to
serue her turne, and the witches confesse, they call them
forth and send them: and that they hire them to hurt such in
their bodies, and in their cattell, as they bee displeased
withall.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I am sorie you are so farre awrie, it is pitie any
man should be in such errour, especiallie a man that hath
learning, and should teach others knowledge.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Nay, I may returne this vpon you, for if you
will denie this, it is but a follie to reason any further: I
will neuer be driuen from that which I knowe: There was
one olde mother (^W.^) of great (^T.^) which had a spirite like a
a Weasill: she was offended highlie with one (^H. M.^) home
she went, and called forth her spirite, which lay in a pot of
woll vnder her bed, she willed him to goe plague the man:
he required what she would giue him, and he would kill
(^H. M.^) She said she would giue him a cocke, which shee
did, and he went, and the man fell sicke with a great paine
in his bellie, languished and died: the witch was arraigned,
<P C4V>
condemned, and hanged, and did confesse all this.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I told you before that I do not deny these things,
but you are deceiued about the doing: you marke not the
cunning sleights of the deuill: Tel me, is not this the truth
which S. Peter speaketh, that (^the deuil goeth about like
a roaring lion, seeking whom he may deuoure. i. Pet. 5.^)
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] What then?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] What then? can you be so simple as to imagine
that the deuill lieth in a pot of wooll, soft and warme, and
stirreth not, but when he is hired and sent? The deuils
conspire together in their worke, they bestirre them, and
neuer take rest night nor day: they are neuer wearie, they be
not a colde, they care not for lying soft: These be fooleries
by which hee deceiueth the witches, and bewitcheth the
mindes of many ignorant people: And whereas you say
he is hired, it is but deceit: for, let me aske you two or three
questions or more if need be.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] What be your questions?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] You say the witch commeth home angrie, who
hath kindled this wrath in her heart but the deuill? Who
inflameth her mind with malice, to be reuenged, and to doe
mischiefe but the deuill? doth not he rule in her heart?
Tell me what you thinke of this?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I muste needes confesse hee stirreth her vp to 
wrath and malice.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Then he lieth not at home in his pot of wool: nor
he is not hyred to this: hitherto she is his drudge, and
obeyeth him, and not he her, being led by his suggestion.
Then tell me, is not the deuill like a red or fierie dragon,
(^Reuel. 12.^) burning in malice against God, and with all
bloodie and cruell hatred that may be against men? And is
he not farre readier vnto all mischiefe, than anie man or
woman?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] The deuill is more fierce than any man or
woman, none can deny this.
<P D1R>
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] If none can deny this, and he be the worker of
the wrath and malice in the heart of the witch; then what
needeth he to be hyred? he stirreth her vp, and if he would, he
could turn her mind from sending him, and must he be
hyred? doth he care for a cock or a chicken? Is he hungry or
needeth he somewhat to eat?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Nay, but it is thought he taketh those thinges
to witnesse against the witch that she is his.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Let it bee, there were somewhat in that which
you speake, yet he hath a farre deeper reach; for the trueth
is, hee woulde, and doeth perswade the blind people, that
he medleth litle, but when he is euen hyred and sent, and
that then his medling is but in such matters: And
hereupon all is on a broyle against old women, which can any
wayes be suspected to be witches, as if they were the very
plagues of the world, and as if all would be well, and safe
from such harmes, if they were rooted out, and thus they
fall a rooting out, without all care: for it is thought that
the witch which hath her spirits, is euen lyke a man which
hath curst dogges, which he may set vpon other mens
cattell, which yet in the nature of dogs, would neuer styrre but
when they are bidden: and so the harmes do come from the
man which oweth those dogs. They think that the country
might be ryd of such spirits, if there were none to hoister
them, or to set them a worke. They imagine that they and
their cattell should then goe safe. Alas poore creatures,
how they be deluded? how litle do they vnderstand the high
prouidence of almighty God which is ouer all?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Doe you thinke then that witches ought not
to be rooted out? or doe you thinke it were not much safety
to the country from harmes, if it could be rid of them?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] For the rooting out of witches, the Scripture
is plaine. (^Thou shalt not suffer a witch to liue^) : but we
are not yet come to that poynt. But whether they be to be
rooted out that men may be safe from harmes, as the
<P D1V>
people in fury and blindnesse imagine, that is next.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Men feele the smart and the harmes which they
doe, and it is no maruell, though they be earnest to haue
them rooted out, and a good riddance it were if the whole
land could be set free from them.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Truelie M. (^B.^) I am of your mind, I wold they wer
all hanged vp by one against another: we should not (I hope)
stand in such fear of the spirits. But I interrupt you too.
   [$ (^The wife.^) $] They that would not haue them hanged or
burnt, I would they might euen witch them vnto hell. If
I had but one fagot in the world, I would carry it a myle
vpon my shoulders to burne a witch.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Well good woman, spare your fagot a while,
and ease your shoulders, and let vs reason the matter a
little further? I pray you let me aske you this question, doth
the witch or the deuill the harme vnto men and cattell?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Why, the deuill doth it at their sending though
I confesse it must needs be as you said, that the deuil
worketh al in the mind of the witch, & mooueth her to send him.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] The deuill hath a kingdome, but it is in
darkenesse and corruption of sinne. He hath no right nor power
ouer Gods creatures, no not so much as to kill one flye, or
to take one eare of corne out of anie mans barne, vnlesse
power be giuen him. You know when Christ cast the deuils
out of the man possessed, they aske leaue for to goe into the
heard of swine. Then tell me, who giueth the deuill this
power then, when the witch sendeth him, to kill or to lame
man or beast? doth the witch giue it him? Do you think he
had power to doe harme, but no mind till she mooued him?
Or doe you take it that her sending giueth him power,
which he had not?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] It is a question indeed worth the asking: For
doubtlesse, the deuill hath not power vntill it be giuen him,
to touch any creature, to hurt, or to destroy the body, but
onely to tempt and to lead into sin: I am also sure that the
<P D2R>
witch cannot giue him power, but onlie God aboue.

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P I2R>
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] This I take to bee your meaning: a man
or a woman is possessed with a Deuill, put case it bee so
indeede (to distinguish them from so many counterfaits, as
haue bene) and men assemble together where the possessed
is, and call vpon God, and then charge Satan in the name
of Christ to tell how hee came there, and who sent him.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I meane so indeede. And some being possessed,
the deuill being charged to tell who sent him, he hath
confessed, that such a man did coniure him in thither, or such a
witch did send him. Shall not this be of force to conuince?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] When any is possessed by the fiend, mens
compassion, their loue and pity are to be shewed, euen to helpe
what they can in such a distresse. They ought with all
instant suit to intreat the Lord to shew mercy, and to expell
him. The doctrin of the holy scriptures doth warrant this:
but for men to talke and question with him, I see no
warrant at all by Gods word, much lesse to commaund and
adiure him to depart. He is the Lords executioner, he hath
sent him, wee may intreat the Lord to remooue him, but
what authority haue we to command him to depart, where
God hath sent him?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Men haue no authority, I grant, but they
<P I2V>
command and adiure him in the name and power of the Lord,
for to depart.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] That I take ought not to be, for mark this
comparison: the Prince is displeased with a subiect for some
disloyaltie: And Officer is sent from the Prince to attach
and imprison him: shall he or any other charge this
Officer in the Princes name to let him alone, and not to
meddle? Is not their way only to pacifie the Prince, and so the
Prince will command the Officer to cease? Euen so, wher
God sendeth Satan his executioner, the only way is to
intreat the Lord to be pacified, for then shall the tormentor
no longer remaine.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Howe doeth this which you speake agree with
that which we read in the Acts of the Apostles, howe S.
Paule commaunded the deuill to come out of a Mayde at
Phillipos?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] The holy Apostles and others in the Primitiue
Church, had an extraordinary power giuen them to caste
foorth deuils, and to heale diseases, and they did execute the
same power by the direction and instinct of the holy Ghost.
We may not draw a patterne from that.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] We see that deuils are sometimes expelled.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] They are when the Lord is intreated, otherwise
they but seeme to be bound by adiuration and expelled. But
how can it be prooued, that the father of lies may be bound,
and forced through charge and adiuration in the name
and power of God to tell the trueth? And what warrant
haue we to learne any trueth from his mouth? As to say
we command thee in the name of God, that thou tel vs who
sent thee. Who sent thee? who sent thee? Mother Ioan,
Mother Ioan, saith he. Also we command thee to tell vs, who
sent thee. L. B. coniured me in hither (saith he) Shal wee
thinke he doeth this euen compelled? Or shall we ground
vpon it for certaintie, that he telleth no lie?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] The deuill in a partie possessed hath said, such a
<P I3R>
man coniured me in hither. The coniurer hath bene put
to death for it, and hath confessed so much. The deuill in an
other hath said, such a woman sent me; it hath likewise bene
confessed by the woman.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] All this maketh for that which I affirme. The
Lord giueth him power to possesse a man. He vnder a
collour will be sent by a coniurer, or by a witch: and the one
thinketh the deuill entreth at her intreaty: the other
supposeth he doeth euen bind him thereto, whereas he ruleth both
their mindes, and setteth them a worke. Then doeth hee
willingly bewray them, euen for many subtill purposes:
but chiefly, that he may establish coniurations, witchcrafts
and charmes, that he may be sought vnto, that he may set
the people a worke in their calamities to be troubled about
witches and coniurers, as though they could plague, and
neuer looke to God, and that bewraying some witches and
coniurers, he may winne credite, and be beleeued, euen
when he accuseth falslie, that he may bring innocent blood
vpon the land. Let all men take heed how vpon their oath
they giue a verdict, especially touching life, vpon his word
howsoeuer he seeme to be forced thereunto: all is most deepe
craft and subtilty in him.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I pray you giue me leaue to speake a litle. You
say the deuill willinglie bewrayeth witches and coniurers
and that for many subtill purposes. I haue heard of diuers
things done of late which seeme quite contrarie, and that
he taketh it grieuously when they doe confesse and bewray
matters.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] He will seeme to take it in euill part, but let vs
heare the matters, and you shall see plainely that hee
iuggleth, and maketh shewe of that which is contrary to his
practise.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Well, I haue heard very credibly, that a woman
of late, suspected another woman to be a witch, & that she
had hurt her some way. She procured a gentleman to send
<P I3V>
for the partie suspected, and charging her in his presence,
she left her to the Gentleman, who taking her aside, and
walking alone with her, began to admonish and perswade
her to renounce the deuill & to forsake such wicked waies:
While he was thus perswading, and she denying stiffely
that she was any such woman, suddainly there appeared
some distance from them, a Weasill or Lobsterre looking
euen vpon them. Looke (said the Gentleman) yonder same
is thy spirit. Ah maister (said she) that is a vermine, there
be many of them euery where. Well, as they went towards
it, it was vanished out of sight: by and by it appeared
againe, and looked vpon them. Surely (saide the 
Gentleman) it is thy spirit: but she still denyed, and with that her
mouth was drawne awrie. Then hee pressed her further,
and she confessed all. She confessed shee had hurt and
killed by sending her spirit. The Gentleman being no
Iustice, let her goe home, and did minde to open the matter
vnto some Iustice: When she was come home, another
witch meeteth her, and saith, Ah thou beast, what hast thou
done? thou hast bewrayed vs all. What remedy nowe (saide
she?) What remedy said the other? send thy spirite & touch
him: she sent her spirit, and of a suddain the Gentleman
had as it wer a flash of fire about him. He lifted vp his hart
to God, and felt no hurt. The spirite returneth, and tolde
he could not hurt him because he had faith: what then, said
the other witch, hath hee nothing that thou maist touch? he
hath a child said the other. Send thy spirit, sayd she, and
touch the child: she sent her spirite, the childe was in great
paine and died. The witches were hanged and confessed.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] What is the chiefe thing which you alleadge
this for?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] To shew how vnwilling the deuill was that the
witch should confesse and bewray things. No doubt it shuld
seeme, that when the Gentleman was talking with her, hee
appeared to call her away, for fear least she should confesse:
<P I4R>
and when she would not come away, he drew her mouth
awry: and when she had confessed, the deuill complayned
vnto the other witch, and made her chide her.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] The thing is as clear as may be, that he 
willinglie bewrayed them: and will you imagine the contrarie?
Why did he appeare in a likenesse, but euen to enforce her
for to confesse, both by abashing, and giuing the 
Gentleman euident notice, especially, when he drew her mouth
awrie? And why did he set on the other witch to mooue her
that had confessed to send her spirit, but that he would haue
the matter more open, and bring them both to light.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] What should mooue him to bewray the witches?
what could he gaine by it?
[^DAN'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED: ARGUES THAT DEVIL WANTS PUBLICITY AND 
THUS WANTS WITCHES TO BE DISCOVERED, AND THAT DEVIL HAD NO POWER TO 
KILL THE CHILD UNLESS POWER IS GIVEN BY GOD, THAT PROBABLY THE DEVIL
KNEW THE CHILD WAS ALREADY ILL, AND THAT DEVILS DO NOT NEED WITCHES 
TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO EVIL.^]
<P I4V>
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I will tell you another thing which was done of
late. A woman being suspected to be a witch, and to haue
done some hurt among cattell, was examined, and
confessed indeed, that she had a spirite which did abide in a hollow
tree, where there was an hole, out of which hee spake vnto
her. And euer when she was offended with anie, shee went
to that tree, and sent him to kill their cattell. She was
perswaded to confesse her fault openly, and to promise that she
wold vtterly forsak such vngodly waies: after she had made
this open confession, the spirite came vnto her being alone.
Ah, said he, thou hast confessed and bewrayed all, I coulde
teeme it to rend thee in peeces: with that she was affrayde
and wound away, and got her into company. Within some
few weeks after, she fel out greatly into anger against one
man. Towards the tree she goeth, and before she came at it,
Ah, said the spirite, wherefore commest thou? who hath
angred thee? Such a man, said the witch. And what wouldest
thou haue me doe saide the spirite? He hath (saith she) two
horses going yonder, touch them or one of them. Well, I
thinke euen that night one of the horses died, and the other
was litle better. Indeede they recouered that one againe
which was not dead, but in verie euill case. Here mee
thinketh it is plaine: he was angry that she had bewrayed all.
And yet when she came to the tree he let goe all displeasure
and went readily.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Doe you thinke all is plaine here. Indeede here
<P K1R>
is that plaine dealing which deuils doe vse. First, doe you
thinke Satan lodgeth in an hollow tree? Is hee become so
lazy, and idle? hath he left off to be as a roaring lion, seeking
whome he may deuour? hath he put off the bloody and
cruell nature of the fiery Dragon, so that he mindeth no harm,
but when an angrie woman shall intreat him to goe kill a
Cow or a horse? Is he become so doting with age, that men
shall espie his craft: yea, be found craftier than he is? Alas
may there not be deep subtiltie in these things?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Doe you thinke there is nothing but subtiltie in
these things?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Doe I think there is nothing but subtiltie? Tel
me what you thinke. What other end can there be but
subtiltie?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] He may haue this purpose (as I think the deuils
studie nothing els) to do harme. 
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I doe not denie that: for all his craft tendeth
vnto harme. But what harme meane you?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] You see here he killed mens cattel.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] It may be he did: but how know you that?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] You see he went at her request & killed one horse,
and almost killed the other.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I wold be loath to adventure my hand vpon that:
For who told you, that he killed the one, and almost killed 
the other?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] The witch her selfe hath confessed the whole
matter.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] VVho told the witch so?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Her spirit told her that he did it at her request.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] He is a credible person, and kind hee was vnto
her as it seemeth.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Nay, but we see all things fell out according as
she confessed.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] How doe you meane?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Why, she confessed her fault, the spirite was
<P K1V>
angrie with her, afterward she fell out with that man, and
vpon this his horse died, she confessed she sent the spirit, how
could all things fall out so fit?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] The spirite when she came towardes the tree,
asked her, wherfore commest thou? who hath angred thee?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] He did so.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] And doe you imagine that the deuill did lie there
and knew nothing vntill she came and told him?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] VVhy needed he aske to her if he did know?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Because hee is subtill: for hee wrought in her
heart, and kindled her wrath, and procured the falling
out betweene her and that man: he did knowe eyther that
the horses at that time had somwhat in them which would
bring death, or els that the Lord had giuen him power for
to strike them: he moued and wrought in her heart to haue
her come againe to the tree: he seemed to be angrie that she
had co~fessed before, but was not, but sought to haue things
knowne. If he had not knowne that the horse should die, 
either by some naturall cause, which woulde then breake
foorth, or by some power giuen to him, he wold not at this
time haue mooued her heart to goe to the tree. And if her
wrath had without his suggestion caried her so farre, he
could quickly haue turned her: for great is the efficacie of
Satans working in the hearts of such.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] But I marked one thing which you said before,
as that it might be that God giueth sometimes power to
the Deuill, euen at the sending of the witch.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I say that God in iustice giueth power vnto
Satan to delude, because men refuse to loue his trueth: but
that maketh not that the deuill obtaineth any power to
hurt because the witch sendeth, but the fault is in men, the
sinnes of the people giue power to the deuill: for God is
offended, and sendeth (as (^S. Paule^) saith) strong
delusion. But haue you any mo examples to prooue that the
Deuill is not willing to haue witches bewrayed?
<P K2R>
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I haue heard of many such like, but you say all is
but craft, and that he would haue men thinke hee doeth all
harmes that are done.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] The Deuill would haue men beleeue that hee
doth all, if he could bring it about: And therefore, it is for
his aduantage if he doe hurte, to haue it not kept secrete,
but openly to be made knowne.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] what say you then vnto this, a witch is
apprehended vpon vehement suspition, and caried before a 
Iustice: he handleth the matter in such sort that she confesseth,
as I heard of one not long since: her confession was to this
effect: She had two spirits, one like a Weasill, the other
like a Mouse. These, she said, did manie thinges for her.
Now, she accused a woman about ten or twelue miles off,
whom (it may be) she did not knowe, and yet could name, 
and not only that, but said, the woman had, as it were, a
litle bigge in her mouth, where the spirite did sucke blood.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] It is a most easie thing for the deuill to tell
witches, that such a man or such a woman is a witch, and hath
this or that secret marke vpon them. And within these few
yeares he hath by witches and cunning men, accused such
as were very religious and godly. Men must beware that
they proceed not vpo~ his testimony: he is not to be medled
withall, nor any medling which he vseth, is to be taken in
good part, seeing he doth all in deep subtilties.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I do take it, that the testimony of the deuill
ought not of it selfe to haue any force with a Iurie, vnlesse
it can be prooued by some other firme proofes. But what
say you vnto this, a witch is condemned, and telleth at the
gallows not onlie what she hath done, but also of whom she
first had her spirit. She doth this in repentance, and euen
readie to depart out of the worlde. It is to bee presumed
that she will not in this case lie, nor accuse falsly: Let it be
some woman in another towne, whome she saith, brought
her the spirite. This woman is also suspected by some of
<P K2V>
her neighbours, apprehended and brought to iudgement,
and stiflie denieth that she is any witch, or that she euer
deliuered any spirite vnto the other which accused her. Nowe
here is the question, Is not the testimonie of the woman
vpon her death, a sufficient warrant for a Iurie to find this
woman guiltie? here they haue now the testimonie not of
the Deuill to proceed by, but of a woman, and though not
vpon her oath, yet vpon her death, which is no lesse.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] This testimonie may seeme to be sufficient euen
to warrant a Iurie to finde guilty, though it touch life: but
if we look well in to it, we shall see it is not.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] It may be you take it to be infirme, because it
is the testimony but of one.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Nay, not only in respect that it is the testimony
but of one, but that it is the testimony of such a one.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I put the case of such an one as doeth shew
repentance, who though she hath bene bad, yet now may bee
beleeued.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I do not meane in that respect, as to say she was
a witch, and therefore not to be credited: but if shee repent
neuer so much, yet her testimony in this is weake, because
she may be vtterly deceiued, and think she telleth the truth,
when it was nothing so, but she vtterly deluded.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Doe you meane, that he may make the other
woman thinke, that such a woman deliuered her the spirit,
and neuer no such matter?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Yea, that is my meaning.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] It is farre beyond my reach to see how that can
bee.
[^DAN'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED: HE ARGUES THAT THE DEVIL MAY APPEAR IN 
THE LIKENESS OF ANOTHER PERSON, AND THAT HE DELUDES WITCHES IN MANY 
OTHER WAYS AND CONFUSES THEIR MINDS.^]
<P K3R>
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] If it be thus, then how should a Iurie condemne
by their verdict any witch? For she hath not killed, nor the
deuill at her request, but maketh her beleeue he did it at her
request.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] A witch by the word of God ought to die the death
not because she killeth men, for that she cannot (vnlesse it be
those witches which kill by poyson, which eyther they
receiue from the deuill, or he teacheth them to make) but
because she dealeth with deuils. And so if a Iurie doe finde
proofe that she hath dealt with deuils, they may and ought
to find them guiltie of witchcraft.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] If they find them guilty to haue dealt with
deuils, and cannot say they haue murdered men, the law doth
not put them to death.
<P K3V>
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] It wer to be wished, that the law were more
perfect in that respect, euen to cut off all such abhominations.
These cunning men and women which deale with spirites
and charmes seeming to doe good, and draw the people
into manifold impieties, with all other which haue
familiarity with deuils, or vse coniurations, ought to bee rooted
out, that others might see and feare.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] You will not haue the testimony of Deuils to
be of any credit with a Iury, what say you then vnto men,
there be some which die, and take it vpon their death, that
they are bewitched, and will say precisely such or such haue
done it. For that is in the other point touching likelihoods.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] They are bewitched indeed, for the deuill doeth
delude their minds: for you shall finde them able to
render no reason but onlie this, in their conscience the partie
is naught and they are out of doubt it is so.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] That may bee as you say in some, but I haue
knowne a woman my selfe which many haue counted to be
a witch, and many things haue fallen out where she hath
taken displeasure. Do you not thinke that is a firm proofe?
She denieth, but the things which fall out, doe manifest
her to be naught.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] You must shew the things, and thereby it will
appeare.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] She fell out, or els at the least seemed to be
displeased with one, and he had an hogge died suddainlie. An
other thought she was displeased with him, and his horse
fell sicke. A third could not sit vpon his stoole at worke.
And within nine or ten yeares space diuers others. One
saw the deuill bigger than a cat with great eies. An other
was haunted with a spirite. An other brewing, the drinke
would not worke in the fatte. An other sawe a thing in her
house as big as a lambe, playing in the window: Another
in her grieuous torment saw the woman stand by her all
the night, whom she suspected to bewitch her, and diuers
<P K4R>
such like, which were too long to recken vp. If she were not
a witch, how should all these fall out so fit?
[^DAN'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED: HE ARGUES THAT THESE THINGS ARE OFTEN
NATURAL AND NOT CAUSED BY THE DEVIL BUT THE DEVIL WANTS TO MAKE PEOPLE 
BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE DONE BY HIM AT THE WITCHES' REQUEST. HE ALSO 
SAYS THAT PEOPLE IMAGINE THEY SEE THINGS IN THE DARK, AND WHEN ILL 
THOSE WITH LITTLE FAITH IN GOD BLAME WITCHES AND THE DEVIL, OR ELSE 
THE DEVIL HIMSELF SAYS A WITCH SENT HIM.^]
<P K4V>
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] And doeth it not fall out sometimes, that as he
saith such a woman sent him, so the woman vpon 
examination confesseth so much.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Yea, but I speak where he hath no witch to deale
by, but pursueth the innocent with suspition vpon
suspition, that men may be guilty of innocent blood. Hee telleth
the trueth sometimes, to the end hee may be credited when
he doth lie. For let no man be so simple as to thinke, that
he will euer tell trueth but for some wicked purpose.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Yet this of all the rest seemeth most strange
vnto me, how so many things should fall out, as it seemeth,
after the displeasure of a suspected person, and some of
them such as apparantly are done by Satan, as in drinke
not working, or in creame, when butter will not come, and
yet the party suspected is not a witch.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Oh sir the sleights of Satan in compassing such
matters be marueilous. I knowe it is taken (as they say) 
to be dead sure that the party is a witch, if sundry such
shewes of matters do concurre. But how easie a thing is
it for crafty deuils to compasse such matters? 
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Then you doe not thinke that common fame
<P L1R>
is sufficient to warrant the conscience of the Iuror, to
condemne any.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Experience doeth teach howe heady much
people are in iudging men or women to be witches vpon
euerie surmise. And the power imagined to bee in witches,
which breedeth a feare in many, causeth them to bee
credulous. Many go so farre, that if they can intice children to
accuse their parents, they thinke it a good worke.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] You say the testimony of the deuill is not to bee
taken, although it be manifest that he doth many times tell
the trueth, because when he speaketh the trueth, hee doeth
it of a bad purpose. And you hold it the testimony of the
deuil, not only which he speaketh when anie charge him, but
also which the cunning men & women giue, in as much as
they can say nothing but vpon his word. Moreouer, vnles
I mistake you, the testimony of a witch in many things at
her death, is not as you say any other than the testimonie
of the deuil, because the deuill hath deceiued her, and made
her beleeue things which were nothing so. Besides al this,
you wil haue likelihoods and suspitions to be of no waight,
nor common fame and opinion to mooue the conscience of
a Iurie, because Satan is exceeding subtill in all these.
Then how shall a Iurie finde a witch? What proofes will
you haue?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Men are vpon their oath to deale, & it doth touch
life, if they doe finde any guiltie of witchcraft. This is a
most waightie matter: whereupon it followeth, that there
must be eyther due proofe by sufficient witnesses, or els the
confession of the witch. For if the testimony be such as may
be false, as al that commeth from deuils is to be suspected:
or if it be but vpon rumors, and likelihoods, in which there
may be exceeding sleights of Satan, as for the most parte
there be: how can that Iury answere before God, which
vpon their oath are not sure, but that so proceeding they
may condemne the innocent, as often it commeth to passe.
<P L1V>
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] You mistake one point, for the finding of a witch
guilty by a Iury doeth not in all causes touch blood.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I am not deceiued, for where the Iurie hauing
but likelihoods doth find a man or a woman guilty but for
killing a beast, it casteth them into prison, setteth them
vpon the pillorie, and not only diffameth them for euer, but
also if suspition follow again and arraignment, it is death:
you see then how neere a way they haue made vnto blood.
But if it touch not blood, but the party escape with the
imprisonment and pillory, & neuer againe fall into suspition,
how grieuous an infamie it is, to haue bene condemned by
Iury to be a witch? I speake it where it is only vpon
suspition, or such testimonie as is onelie from Satan, and the
partie may be cleere.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] It falleth out sometimes that vpon suspition
and common fame they hitte right, and the partie which
would not confesse any witchery vpon examination, and
arraignment, being condemned doth confesse it.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Let it be graunted that the Iury vpon Satans
testimony, or suspitions and common fame, sometimes
hitteth right, which yet I feare is very seldome, that is no
warrant before God for men that are sworne, for are they
sworne to indict vpo~ likelihoods, or vpon knowledge in that
which vpon sound testimony or confession they shall finde?
If the party be a witch which is suspected, & yet no proofe,
the Iury doeth more rightly in acquitting, than in
condemning, for what warrant haue they vpon their oath to
goe by gesse, or to find that which they knowe not?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I doe take it men offend grieuously, if vpon 
vnsufficient proofe they condemne the innocent, and
especially, because they are solemnly sworne: but if they hit right,
though it be only by coniectures and likelihoods, I cannot
see how they should therein offend: they condemne not the
innocent, they do the party no wrong.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I do not say they are to bee charged with any
<P L2R>
innocent blood, or wrong to the partie: but I aske what
warrant they haue before God vpon oath to touch blood by
suspitions [^SOURCE TEXT: suspitons^] . Admit one be arraigned vpon  # 
felony, the
likelihoods ar great that he is guiltie of the same, but yet it may
be hee is cleere. What is a Iurie nowe to doe? Are they to
venture vpon the life of a man by their oath by suspitions?
Let it be he is one that God knoweth to be guiltie, but no
man can disclose the same, and therefore they cleare him,
doe they commit anie offence? Are they bound to find that
which they cannot know? What innocent person then may
not be condemned?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I pray you giue me leaue a litle. I doe not well
conceiue this matter about finding out and condemning of
witches. It is somewhat strange vnto me which you speak
I haue my selfe sundry times bene of the Iurie when
witches haue bene arraigned, we haue found them guilty
vpon common fame, vpon likelihoods, and vpon such
testimonie as you disalow. They haue indeed taken it vpon their
deaths that they were innocent, but that neuer made me to
doubt but that they were witches: for it is saide, the deuill
hath such power ouer them, that he will not suffer them to
confesse.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] What should mooue you to thinke that the deuill
will not haue them to confesse? you see some doe confesse
when they be examined, and when they be executed: The
deuil hath power ouer the most desperat theeues and
murtherers?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Yea but he careth not so much though the theeues
and the murtherers do confesse, it maketh not so much
against him, as when witches bewray all.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] What, doe you take it he is loath to be diffamed
or hardly thought off? Otherwise what should it make
against him when witches confesse? It is some step to
repentance when theeues and murtherers acknowledge
their sinnes, and if he can hinder them, or hold them
<P L2V>
desperate from confessing he will. It is apparant that he
coueteth to haue witches to confesse, it maketh so much for
him. He would haue men iudge that there be an hundred
folde more witches than there be. He discloseth by his
cunning men & women, and otherwise. He coueteth greatly to
haue it thought that he doeth all, in tempestes, in strange
plagues and diseases which light vpon man or beast. And
for this cause hee maketh the witch beleeue and confesse
more than all, that is, that at her request he did that which
he neuer did nor could doe: vnlesse we will denie the
soueraintie, and prouidence of God ouer all.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] If Satan gaine so much by disclosing them, what
should be the reason that men are generally perswaded that
he coueteth to haue the thinges kept secret, and so will not
let the witch confesse.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] It ariseth from false perswasions, and fro~ a false
feare that witches doe so many harmes, and that at their
sending and request the spirites worke all. If Satan be so
kind and seruiceable to the witch: how is it that he doth not
fetch her some money? For he knoweth where it is lost, or
where it lyeth in mens houses. He telleth the witch he can
make a man lame. He saith he can kill an horse. Yea at
sometime he will say he can and will (if she will haue it so)
kill a man. As if it were in his power to doe many great
thinges, and will not but requested. Let vs see if all the
deuils can fetch one peny out of a mans house, whose horse or
cow they say they haue killed. The coniurer, sayth he, can
coniure him into a man, or out of a man: let him coniure
him but into a mans chest if he can, to fetch somewhat from
thence. If the deuils can not do these thinges, then be
assured that either they make but a shew of killing and laming,
as they do in the most of such harmes, or else where they do
hurt, it is vpon speciall leaue from God, and not from the
witches pleasure. And to what purpose then should all such
iugglings and shewes serue, if they should be kept close and
<P L3R>
not confessed.
[^SAM'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED: HE RECOUNTS HIS JURY EXPERIENCE, THAT A 
WOMAN WAS EXECUTED AS A WITCH ON THE STRENGTH OF ACCUSATIONS BY HER 
NEIGHBOURS THAT SHE HAD BEWITCHED THEM AFTER THEY HAD QUARRELLED WITH 
HER, ALTHOUGH SHE SWORE SHE WAS INNOCENT.^]
<P L3V>
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Nay what thinke you? Are you sure she was a
witch? May it not be she was innocent, and you vpon your
oathes shed innocent bloud?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] If she were innocent what could we do lesse? we
went according to the euidence of such as were sworne,
they swore that they in their conscience tooke her to bee a 
witch, and that she did those thinges.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] If other take their oath that in their conscience 
they thinke so, is that sufficient to warrant men vpon mine
oath to say it is so?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Nay, but you see what matters they brought,
which perswaded them to thinke so.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Might not both you and they be deceiued in your
thinking, or may you vpon matters which may induce you
to thinke so, present vppon your oath that you knowe it
is so?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] If witnesses come in and sweare falsely, the
Iurie proceeding according, their testimonie is cleare from
blame, for they goe but by testimonie of men sworne.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] If witnesses doe sweare directly that in their
knowledge a matter was so or so, and sweare falsely, the
Iurie is cleare which proceedeth according to their euidence:
<P L4R>
vnlesse the Iurie do perceiue that their oath can not be true.
But what is that to make the testimonie sufficient where
men doe but thinke, and can shewe no necessarie reason to
ground their thought vpon? As let vs see in all these which
one could prooue that she must needes be a witch. One saith
her husband tooke it vpon his death that she killed him,
because he would not lend her fiue shillings: doth this prooue
she bewitched him? Can the deuill kill a man at his 
pleasure, to gratifie the witch? Is it not rather to be iudged he
dyed of some pining sicknesse growing from an euill
constitution of body, which the deuill did know, and would set
him at some variance with one old woman or other, that so
it might breede suspition of witchcraft.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] You see there were some things which could not
be done but by the deuill.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] In deede the great face which the man thought he
saw, was the illusion of the deuill. But is this a good proofe,
the deuill appeareth to a man after he hath displeased a
woman, therefore she sent him? Doth not Satan haunt all
men continually, and would if he could get leaue from God,
terrifie them with such illusions: When men are affraide,
and haue strong imaginations? What reason did the
woman shew which tooke it vpon her conscience that the olde
woman killed her child, to prooue that it was so? If shee
thought so in her conscience, and tenne thousand more with
her vpon bare imagination, was that a warrant for you to
sweare solemnely that it was so? As for the testimony of
the cunning woman that he was bewitched which had the
paine in his backe, vpon the deniall of pot-hearbes, it was
the testimony but of the deuill, as I shewed before. And
what is common fame grounded vpon imaginations?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Then you thinke we did amisse do you?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I would not vpon mine oath doe such a thing for
to gaine a kingdome.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] It may be she was a witch, although she tooke it
<P L4V>
vpon her death that she was not.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] It is rather to be thought she was not a witch:
for what should make her deny it vpon her death? The
deuill had accused her to be a witch, for direct testimonie
against her but his.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] You say it was the deuill that told by the cunning
woman that she was a witch.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] And do you thinke it was any other but Satan?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I did not at that time thinke it was the deuill:
but now I see it could be none other.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Then be wiser hereafter, and sorie for that which
you haue done.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Indeede I haue cause to be greeued if shee were
not a witch.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] If she were a witch your warrant was small:
but she being no witch, you haue taken away both her life,
and couered her with infamie.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I was of an other Iurie since, and there was a
woman indicted for a witch, but not for killing any man or
child. There came in fiue or sixe against her: the first was
an old woman, and she sayd she had displeased her, as shee
thought, and within two or three nights after as she sate by
her fire, there was a thing like a toad, or like some little
crabbe fish which did creepe vpon the harth, she tooke a
beasome & swept it away, and suddainly her bodie was griped.
An other fell out with her as she sayd, and her hennes began
to die vp, vntil she burnt one henne aliue. A third man came
in, and he sayd she was once angry with him, he had a dun
cow which was tyed vp in a house, for it was in winter, he
feared that some euill would follow, and for his life he could
not come in where she was, but he must needes take vp her
tayle and kisse vnder it. Two or three other came in & sayd
she was by common fame accounted a Witch. We found
her giltie, and she was condemned to prison, and to the
pillorie, but stoode stiffe in it that she was no witch.
<P M1R>
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] And are you sure she was one?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I thinke verily shee was one, although there be
many of her neighbors which thinke she is none: for how
could those thinges followe so vpon her anger? It seemeth
they were all done by the deuill.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] He is cunning that can tell that: let it be that it
was the deuil which appeared to the old woman like a toad,
or like a crabbe fish, and that he did gripe her bodie: doth
it follow therefore of necessitie that the other woman sent
him? He can not turne him selfe into any likenesse vnlesse
God giue him leaue, as he doth in iustice permit that so he
may delude ignora~t persons: No witch can giue him power
to appeare vnto any in a visible shape. He had this
graunted him from God, and Satan by and by will set anger, and
then appeare, that it might seeme it grew from that.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Wee see he appeareth vnto witches, and
coniurers.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Yea but we may not thinke he can at his
pleasure take a likenes for to appeare in. That he doth appeare
vnto witches and coniurers, it is graunted in Gods wrath
to the ende he may strongly delude such wicked people as
will not heare and obey the voyce of the Lord God. For the
deuils are chained vp by Gods most mightie power &
prouidence, and in all thinges so farre as he letteth foorth their
chaine, so farre they proceede, one inch further they can not
proceede. Where men loue darkenes more then light, hee
hath leaue giuen him to do many thinges. Some he
terrifieth with vgley shapes, some he intiseth with faire shewes,
others he playeth withall in liknes of a Weasell, or Mouse, 
or some such small vermine.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I thought Satan could appeare in what likenesse
he would, and to whom he would, if the witch sent him.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Therein you were much deceiued: for the sending
by the witch can giue him no power, and if he had power,
he would no doubt in all places appeare vnto many as farre
<P M1V>
and in such sort, as should best serue his turne. Therefore
if he appeare vnto any man, let him thinke God hath giuen
him leaue to goe thus farre with me, and let him call for
faith to resist him, and for true wisedome that he may not
be deceiued nor deluded by him.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] But doth he not appeare sometimes when the
witches send him?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Where he findeth it is graunted vnto him for to
appeare, he moueth witches to sende him if he haue any to
deale by: but if there be none, yet will he appeare, & deale
so farre as he hath power giuen him.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] But what say you to the womans hennes?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] What should one say to them when they be dead.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I meane doe you not thinke they were
bewitched?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Christ saith, a Sparrow can not fall without the
will of your heauenly Father: and is not a henne as good
as a Sparrow?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Nay I am fully perswaded by that which you
haue sayd, that the deuill can not touch any thing to kill or
to hurt it, but vpon speciall leaue from God. They can giue
him no power, she thinketh she setteth him on, and it is he
that setteth her on worke. Let these things be no more
called into question: but was it not euident that the deuill
killed those hennes? because after the burning of one henne,
the woman had no mo that dyed. If Satan did it not, how
could they cease dying for that? You sayd that he where hee
hath power to hurt in such bodely harmes, is willing to
cease, that such wickednesse may be practised. And then if
this hurt were done by the deuill, is it not to bee thought
that the woman was a witch, seeing it followed after shee
was angry? Let it be that Satan hauing power to do that
he did, would be sent by the witch for a colour, and to make
it euident did set anger between her and that other woman,
to make men thinke that he would not deale, but intreated
<P M2R>
by her being angry. And so we could doe no lesse but finde
her a witch.
[^DAN'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED: HE ARGUES THE HENS MIGHT HAVE DIED OF 
NATURAL CAUSES, AND THE DEVIL KNOWING THIS ENCOURAGED THE WOMEN TO 
QUARREL SO THAT SHE WOULD BE ACCUSED OF WITCHCRAFT, OR ELSE THAT
HE KILLED THEM HIMSELF FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN 
COINCIDENCE THAT NO MORE HENS DIED AFTER THE BURNING, OR THAT THE 
DEVIL WAS LAZY, OR SCARED BY THE BURNING, OR ELSE THAT HE CAUSED 
THE WOMAN TO BURN A HEN, TO MAKE THE PREVIOUS DEATHS SEEM THE RESULT 
OF WITCHCRAFT.^]
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Then you thinke he did not kill those hennes.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] What certainetie had you that he did kill them?
You found it vpon your oath that he killed them, and that
such a woman sent him and set him a worke, and yet it is
an hundreth to one hee neuer had power for to touch
them.
<P M2V>
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] But what can you say to the other? The man
which could not chuse but kisse vnder his cowes tayle?
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] I say he was farre in loue with his cow. Let such
men learne to know God, & to expell fantasies out of their
mindes that the deuill may not haue such power ouer the~,
for he worketh in the fantasies of mans mind, and the more
strongly where they feare him, as it appeareth this man
did. Satan did worke in this mans minde many foolish
imaginations, and to make him beleeue he was bewitched
he maketh him fall out with one that may be suspected.
And thus you Iurie men take your oath & condemne
many innocent persons, because you beleeue the deuill, &
imagine that witches do that which they can not do.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I haue heard of many that haue beene 
condemned for witches which haue taken it vpon their death that
they were innocent. And sundry of the~ haue had farre 
weaker proofes brought against them then these that haue bin
mentioned.
   [$ (^Dan.^) $] Yea that is it which I say, men do so little
consider the high soueraignety and prouidence of God ouer all
things: they ascribe so much to the power of the deuill and
and to the anger of witches, and are in such feare of them,
that the least shew that can be made by the sleights of
Satan deceiueth them. The only way for men that will eschew
the snares & subtilties of the deuil and all harmes by him,
is this, euen to heare the voyce of God, to be taught of him
by his liuely word which is full of pure light to discouer
& expell the darke mistes of Satan in which he leadeth men
out of the way. and to be armed with faith to resist him, as
the holy Apostle S. Peter willeth, so such as doe forsake
this way are seduced into grosse errors & into many
abominable sinnes, which carrie men to destruction. I must
now bidde you farewell.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I could be content to heare more in these
matters, I see how fondly I haue erred. But seeing you must
<P M3R>
be gone, I hope we shall meete here againe at some other
time, God keepe you.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I am bound to giue you great thankes. And I
pray you when occasion serueth, that you come this way,
let vs see you at my house.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I thought there had not beene such subtill
practises of the deuil, nor so great sinnes as he leadeth me~ into.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] It is strange to see how many thousands are
carried awry and deceiued, yea many that are very wise men.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] The deuill is too craftie for the wisest, vnlesse
they haue the light of Gods word.
   [$ (^The wife of Sam.^) $] Husband yonder commeth the good
wife R.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I would she had come sooner.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Ho, who is within, by your leaue.
   [$ (^The wife of Sam.^) $] I would you had come a litle sooner,
here was one euen now that sayd you are a witch.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Was there one sayd I am a witch?
you do but iest.
   [$ (^The wife of Sam.^) $] Nay I promise you he was in good
earnest.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] I a Witch? I defie him that sayth
it, though he be a Lord. I would all the witches in the land
were hanged, and their spirits by them.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Would not you be glad if their spirites were
hanged vp with them to haue a gowne furred with some of
their skinnes.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Out vpon them, there were furre.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Wife why diddest thou say that he sayd the good
wife R. is a witch? he did not say so.
   [$ (^The wife of Sam.^) $] Husband I did marke his wordes
well ynough, he sayd she is a witch.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] He doth not know her, and how could he say she
is a witch?
   [$ (^The wife of Sam.^) $] What though he did not know her?
did he not say she played the witch that hette the spitte red
<P M3V>
hotte, and thrust it into her creame, when the butter would
not come?
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] Indeede wife, thou sayest true, he said that was a
thing taught by the deuill, as also the burning of an henne
or of an hogge aliue, and all such like deuises.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Is that witchcraft? Some
scripture man hath tolde you so. Did the deuill teach it? Nay
the good woman at R. H. taught it my husband: she doeth
more good in one yeare than all these scripture men will
doe so long as they liue.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Who doe you thinke taught it the cunning
woman at R. H.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] It is a gift which God hath giuen
her, I thinke the holie spirite of God doth teach her.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] You doe not thinke then that the deuill doeth
teach her?
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] How should I thinke that the
Deuill doeth teach her? Did you euer heare that the deuill did
teach any good thing?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Doe you know that was a good thing?
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Was it not a good thing to driue
the euill spirit out of my creame?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Do you thinke the deuill was affraid of your spit?
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] I knowe he was driuen away, and
we haue bene rid of him euer since.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] Can a spit hurt him?
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] It doth hurt him, or it hurteth the
witch: One of them I am sure: for he commeth no more.
Either she ca~ get him come no more, because it hurteth him:
or els she will let him come no more, because it hurteth her.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] It is certaine that spirites cannot be hurt but
with spirituall weapons: therefore your spit cannot fraie
nor hurt the deuill. And how can it hurt the witch, you did
not thinke she was in your creame, did you?
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Some thinke she is there, &
therefore, when they thrust in the spitte they say, If thou beest
<P M4R>
[^SOURCE TEXT GIVES PAGE M4R AS T4^]
here haue at thine eie.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] If she were in your creame, your butter was
not very cleanly.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] You are merrily disposed (^M. B.^)
I know you are of my minde, though you put these
questions to me. For I am sure none hath counselled more to go
to the cunning folke than you.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I was of your minde, but I am not nowe, for
I see how foolish I was. I am sorie that euer I offended so
grieuously as to counsaill any for to seeke vnto deuils.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Why, (^M. B.^) who hath schooled
you to day? I am sure you were of another mind no longer
agone than yesterday.
   [$ (^The wife of Sam.^) $] Truely goodwife R. I thinke my
husband is turned also: here hath bene one reasoning with
them three or foure howers.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Is your husband turned to? I wold
you might loose all your hens one after an other, and then I
would she would set her spirite vpon your duckes and your
geese, and leaue you not one aliue. Will you come to
defend witches?
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] We do not defend witches.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Yes, yes, there be too many that take
their part, I would they might witch some of the~ euen into
hell, to teach others to defend them. And you (^M. B.^) I wold
your nagge might hault a little one of these dayes: see
whether you would not be glad to seeke helpe.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I would seeke helpe, I would carry him to the
smith to search if he were not pricked or graueld.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Tush you laugh, If you were
plagued as some are, you wold not make so light account of it.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] You thinke the deuill can kill mens cattell, and
lame both man and beast at his pleasure: you thinke if the
witch intreate him and send him he will go, and if she will
not haue him go, he will not meddle. And you thinke when
he doth come, you can driue him away with an hoat spitte,
<P M4V>
or with burning a liue henne or a pigge.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Neuer tell me I thinke so, for you
your selfe haue thought so: and let them say what they can
all the Scripture men in the world shall neuer perswade
me otherwise.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] I do wonder, not so much at your ignorance as
at this, that I was euen of the same mind that you are and
could not see mine owne folly.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] Folly? how wise you are become of
a suddaine? I know that their spirits lye lurking, for they
foster them: and when any body hath angred them, then
they call them forth and send them. And looke what they
bid them do, or hire them to do, that shall be done: as when
she is angry, the spirite will aske her what shall I do? such
a man hath misused me sayth she, go kill his Cow, by and
by he goeth & doth it. Go kill such a womans hens, downe
go they. And some of them are not content to do these lesser
harmes, but they will say, go make such a man lame, kill
him, or kill his child. Then are they readie and will do
any thing: And I thinke they be happy that can learne to
driue them away.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] If I should reason with you out of the worde of
God, you should see that all this is false which you say. The
deuill can not kill nor hurt any thing no not so much as a
poore henne. If he had power who can escape him? Would
he tarrie to be sent or intreated by a woman? he is a stirrer
vp vnto all harmes and mischiefes.
   [$ (^The good wife R.^) $] What tell you me of Gods worde?
doth not Gods word say there be witches, and doe not you
thinke God doth suffer bad people? Are you a turnecote?
Fare you well, I will talke no longer with you.
   [$ (^M. B.^) $] She is wilfull in deede. I will leaue you also.
   [$ (^Sam.^) $] I thanke you for your good companie.
