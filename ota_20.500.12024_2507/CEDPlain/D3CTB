[$Enter Sir (^Oliver Bellingham^) , and M. (^William^) .$]

   [$M. (^William.^) $]
Beleeve me Sir, I have told you what your worship
may most certainly trust to.
   [$ (^Sir Oliver.^) $] May I not speak with her?
   [$ (^M. William.^) $] You know my place.
There's no more hope from the deepe pit of griefe
To raise in her any conceit of love,
Then there's to raise her husband up againe
From the cold bed he sleepes in: from the Grave.
Take this for all: My Lady Sir, has vow'd
To live, and die a Widdow. -- So I leave you. -- [$ (^Exit Shut.^) $]
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Is't possible, that such a one as shee;
So young, so beautifull; so full of blood;
Such lusty blood, as shee's? for such a losse,
Should lose that youth; that Beauty, that quick blood
In such a cold retirement? -- Well, I know not!
But if she have made such a vow, and keepe it!
To finde out such another, and a Phaenix,
Is but an equall labour. [$ (^Enter M. Rash.^) $]
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Save you Sir (^Oliver^) ; save you, sweet Sir     #
(^Oliver^) .
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] As much to you Sir; kind M. (^Rash^) .
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] You have bin with the Widdow; this melancholly
Lady already. Give you much joy of your faire hopes Sir
(^Oliver^) .
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] As much to your self; to your self Sir, kind   #
M. (^Rash^) .
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Ile hope as much as I can, though you be a Knight;
and I but an honest Citizen. A Mercer, is a Merchant, and
<P B1V>
will looke for good Ware, for his Money. [$ (^To the dore.^) $]
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] If he should enter now? -- Ile see the issue.
[$ (^Enter M. William.^) $]
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] You know my comming: to speak with your Lady, M.  #
(^William^) .
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] But shee's not at leasure to heare you.
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] I hope you doe but jeast.
   [$ (^M. Wil.^) $] Beleeve me Sir, in earnest.
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] But I'le not take't in earnest. [$ (^Offer to the #
dore.^) $]
   [$ (^M. Wil.^) $] But you must. -- Then you'll be (^Rash^) indeed #
Sir.
Though you be a Citizen, you are not free of this Hall,
And therefore must have no admittance. [$ (^Exit Shut.^) $]
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Give you much joy of your faire hopes.
Another? [$ (^Enter Plush, a Gallant.^) $]
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] Save you Gentlemen: how is't M. (^Rash^) ?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] As well as we may, M. (^Plush^) .
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] You have got the start of me, I see that         #
Gentlemen.
A Suit, brought me home this morning, made me lye so much
the longer: but, my Taylors long Bill, like a Woodcock, as
hee is, shall be so much the longer a paying. -- You have
beene within?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] In our time Sir.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] I meane, this morning.
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] But -- the Lady meanes no such thing Sir.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] We heard of your Worships new Suit, and would
not goe in before it.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] I'le lead the way then. [$ (^Stamp at the        #
dore.^) $]
[$ (^Enter M. William.^) $]
M. (^William^) ? good morrow good morrow sweet M. (^William^) .
   [$ (^M. Wil.^) $] That sweet, to your sweetest selfe Sir.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] And where's thy Lady? -- You see, we come, to
come to her. -- [$ (^Offer to the dore.^) $]
   [$ (^M. Wil.^) $] By your favour Sir, you are too hasty.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] Why, is not thy Lady up yet?
   [$ (^M. Wil.^) $] Why, doe you meane to take her downe Sir?
-- Buy Sir. [$ (^Exit shut.^) $]
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] This Fellow's sawcie.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Minds not your Worships new Suit Sir. -- But
we must be content.
<P B2R>
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] We may be patient Sir, but not content; for
nothing contents me, but the Lady. [$ (^Enter Sir Robert Malory.^) $]  
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Nor me, but that beautifull Lady.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Who have wee here? Sweet and soft, M.          #
(^Plush^) .
M. (^Rash^) ! -- I dare be so bold as embrace you too. -- But
my Noble Sir. My Sir, of a thousand (^ (\per annum\) ^) .
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] Why, I can be a Knight, an I lust Sir.
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] An I can be a Knight, an I lust Sir.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Dubd, with the Citie Dagger. -- Then (^Rash^) ,
would be rash indeed. You come to see my Sister?
   [$ (^Both.^) $] With all our hearts we would Sir.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] 'Las good hearts.
Me thinks the Gates should of themselves flye ope,
To such brave men as you are.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] You have the old heart, still Sir.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] The young heart still Sir (^Oliver^) ; -- tho  #
mad
heart, -- the merry heart; the light heart, with the candle
of conceit, burning in it, as bright as (^Lucifer, Hesper, Vesper^) .
You have not bin within? I will make out this paire of Aces,
And then you shall see my Sister.
I perceive by your melancholy looks,
My melancholy, pettish, peevish Sister,
Is not at this time to be spoke withall.
'Tis such a foolish thing; -- She knowes not worth,
Nor how to entertain't: suffice it Gentlemen,
I doe; -- And shall not goe behind her back
To let her know your merit.
   [$ (^Both.^) $] Will you Sir?
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] And in a just proportion to that merit,
That Masse of Merit, you shall finde her favour:
So M. (^Plush^) , and worthy M. (^Rash^) ,
I shall desire you leave us.
   [$ (^Both.^) $] You'll remember.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Shall I remember (Gentlemen) to eat?
To drink? to sleep? -- Then Ile remember you. [$ (^Exit Plush and    #
Rash.^) $]
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Then? -- When Sir (^Robert^) ?
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] When I am asleepe. -- Awake, I shall never
<P B2V>
mind e'm. For their Worships are hardly worth it.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Yet in a just proportion, to their merit.      #
[$ (^Ent. Abram.^) $] 
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Yes, that's just nothing: -- Hang e'm          #
gloworms, hang e'm.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Here's another rub in our Ally Sir.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] A Tennants sonne o' mine. -- And how does
my honest (^Abr'am^) .
   [$ (^Abr.^) $] The better your good Worship is well Sir. I was
to seeke your good Worship, at your Right Worshipfull
house Sir: but, missing you there, I rejoyce I have met with
you here.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Why, what's the matter (^Abr'am^) , what's the #
matter?
   [$ (^Abra.^) $] In the way of love, as they say: from my father,
and my suster; and my tother suster too; -- You know who
I meane, Sir (^Robert^) .
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Thy scolding sister. [$ (^Abr.^) $] You are in #
the right, Sir (^Robert^) .
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] And how does (^Margaret^) , my pretty Tennant?
   [$ (^Abra.^) $] That pretty one, is prettily well Sir.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Remember me to her by this. -- [$ (^A Ring.^) $] 
Within these two or three dayes, at the furthest, I should
breath a Gelding; It may be, that wayes, and visit my 
pretty Tennant.
   [$ (^Abra.^) $] Long may your Worships Gelding breathe, and
your Worshipfull selfe also.
I am in hast Sir (^Robert^) .
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Take your own time good (^Abram^) .            
   [$ (^Abra.^) $] Thank your good Worship Sir (^Robert^) .          #
[$ (^Exit with Congies.^) $] 
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] I have done your patience wrong; indeed I have;
But, in the best, that lyes in me to right it [$ (^Dore stamp.^) $] 
You shall command me Sir: Now to my Sister.
Now, where's my Sister? [$ (^Enter Master^) William.$]
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] Shee's within Sir (^Robert^) .
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Come then, let's to her. [$ (^M. Wil.^) $] You #
must pardon me,
Shee's so retyr'd to solitude; and set
So deep in grief, that till her sighs, and teares,
Will give her leave to give that entertain
That shall become such worthy Visitants,
(Which yet, they will not) tis her strict command
<P B3R>
That no man enter.
   [$ (^S. Rob.^) $] Not my self?
   [$ (^M Wil.^) $] Your self,
Sir, if you would not swell her grief too big
For her faint breast to carry, give her way.
A little time may change her. [$ (^Exit^) shut$] 
   [$ (^S. Rob.^) $] Tis enough. -- You see Sir (^Oliver^) .
   [$ (^S Oli.^) $] Your Love, Sir (^Robert^) .
   [$ (^S. Rob.^) $] But, as her Gentleman discreetly said,
A little time may change her: We must still
In such a kind humour a womans will.
But, she's thine own, be bold on't. -- [$ (^ (\Exeunt.\) ^) $]  
[$ (^Enter Master^) William, (^and^) Barbara.$] 
   [$ (^M. W.^) $] Come, thou mak'st such a Matter, of Nothing.
   [$ (^Bab.^) $] Nothing, doe you call it, Master (^William^) ? I   #
know 
not, but I am sure, I feel it something -- Tis almost, kicking
ripe already.
   [$ (^M. W.^) $] Almost, kicking ripe already, -- Come, come, thou
art, A Chamber-maid still; -- And I prethee, whats this, but
a work that belongs to the Chamber? Kicking ripe already,
This is not the first time, that thou hast been kickt with an
urchin. Once, Twice, -- this is the third time of kicking.
   [$ (^Bab.^) $] Well, you wo'not, marry me?
   [$ (^M. W.^) $] And hazard my place, wo my Lady? -- and yet,
Now I think on't. -- I will --
   [$ (^Bab.^) $] Marry me?
   [$ (^M. W.^) $] To some of my old acquaintance. There be a 
hundred in the City, that have swallowed worse bits then thou
art. Hist.
[$ (^Enter the Lady^) Mosely (^in mourning, veild; the Lady^) 
Malory, (^and an old Gentlewoman^) .$] 
I know, my danger, and shall have a care, according.
   [$ (^La, Mos.^) $] Beseech you. Let the love you seeme to shew
In these perswasions, be exprest in words,
That better suit with such a robe as this,
And my immutable resolve.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Immutable? -- then we perswade, in vain.
<P B3V>
   [$ (^M. W.^) $] I am bound to say
You have lost a worthy Gentleman; -- My selfe,
A noble Master; -- one that was a Man
Worth your best memory: the multitude
Of sighs you have sent after him, worth all
The expence of teares, you have bestowed upon him.
But when we look into his Tombe and there
See him lock'd up in Marble; -- in the still,
And sad imagin'd language of the Grave,
We are instructed, Nay, commanded Lady,
To period our vain grievings.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] He has told you the naked truth on't.
'Tis but in vaine to grieve; -- For, is't not sed
The quick must live byth' quick, and not byth' dead?
He's gone, -- Heaven be with him; -- He was a Gentleman;
An honest man; -- and, which is more; -- a proper Gentleman:
But, when Gentility, -- Honesty, -- and proportion,
Lye in the Grave once, I ha' done with 'em.
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] Thy tongue's my ceaslesse torment.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Let me tell you,
That infinite of love you seeme to have fixt,
Upon the heart of your departed Husband,
Loses no scruple, of the worth it has,
Plac'd on a second Husband.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Mark you that now?
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Nay, I dare tell you, that in a second Match,
You love him more; more love, more honour him,
Then, in your mourning Widdowhood.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Mark you that now?
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Ile make it open to you: whilst you keepe
Incompast, with this solitude, a Widow,
You seeme, to voyce, to the ill-censuring world,
Some imperfection in your selfe; some staine
Makes you unworthy of a second Match:
At lest, unworthy, of a worthy Husband,
And in th' opinion, (which is easily rais'd)
Question your Husbands judgement. -- Or, it may be,
<P B4R>
The estate he left you Lady; -- pulling so
Upon the Name, you strive to dignifie,
Disgrace, defames, and scandall.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Mark you that now?
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] If you so lov'd him living, love him dead,
As I advise you Lady.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] I, I, doe.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] 'Tis the best Tomb-stone you can lay upon him;
The noblest Monument, you can erect;
And to that Monument, an Epitaph,
Shall make him live for ever.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Law you there now! -- Shal make him live for   #
ever!
You are not dumb tro? -- are you?
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] Would thou wer't.
Or I had lost my hearing. -- I can wish
Nothing more adverse to me, then your tongues:
And therefore, if your visits bring with them
Nothing, but these perswasions.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Keepe away.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Nay, as good speak't as think it. -- Here's a
coyle for a Husband, I have had for mine owne part, -- 1.
-- 2. -- 3. -- 4. And yet if the fift come up handsomly to
me, -- I know what I know, I warrant you.
   [$ (^La, Mal.^) $] How five? [$ (^Enter^) M. (^William^) .$] 
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Fifteene, an the Destinies so have decreed it.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] Madame, there be Suiters below would see you:
M. (^Rash^) , the Mercer; -- one (^Plush^) , a humorous Gallant;
-- and a spick and span new Suiter, a Country Gentleman,
-- one, M. (^Gregory Dwindle^) .
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Spruce M. (^Rash^) I know.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] And I M. (^Plush^) , a notable humorous Coxcomb.
But what's that (^Gregory^) ?
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] Unknowne to me: but beleeve me, together,
They make up, a delicate motion. -- Is your Ladiship pleas'd
to see 'em?
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Present your Motion some-where else, our griefes
give way to no such lightnesse.
<P B4V>
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] Very good. -- I'le tell e'm what you say?
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Pray stay a little.
I know these Suiters are but empty things;
Not worth one serious entertaine; yet Sister,
I wo'd not have you beat e'm back, at dore:
Pray let e'm enter; Let e'm looke upon you.
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] Still your desire's, my anguish.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Come, come, pray. -- You are so melancholly.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Why, their mirth -- will be a means to cure you.
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] Kill me rather.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Goe, prethee bid e'm come.
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] Bid e'm be gone.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Nay, then, y'are too too cruell. -- Prethee    #
stay.
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] Nay, an you know no other merriment,
Then what you raise from my vexation, take it;
I will not hinder your desires; pray take it.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] You will not leave us, will you?
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] Leave this roome.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] And goe mew your selfe up in your Chamber?
An you will needs: -- Let me entreat one favour.
   [$ (^L. Mos.^) $] Well, what is't?
   [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] That, in your absence you'd be pleas'd to let
Your wayting Gentlewoman, Mistris (^Barbary^) ,
Appeare in your apparrell: Tis but slipping off
This upper garment; and this mourning Veile,
And shee's my Lady.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] How? -- My Bab, my Lady!
   [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] It will be sport to us; and to your selfe
A rare advantage Sister: for this trick
Keepes all your foolish Suiters at that distance,
Their trouble shall ne're touch you. -- Will you?
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Will you?
   [$ (^L. Mos.^) $] Though pleasure, be no pleasure to this bosome,
Since you propose th'acquittance of that trouble,
Your desire's granted.
   [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] But be speedie then
With your directions for her carriage in it, [$ (^Exit L. Mosly.^) $] 
<P C1R>
And we shall fit 'em neatly. -- Call e'm in.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Did you ever see such a self-will'd thing as   #
this is?
-- a widdow these two moneths, and yet not heare of a 
Suiter. [$ (^Enter M. William, Rash, Plush,
and Gregory.^) $] 
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] The Gentlemen, an't please you.
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] Yes indeed, an't please you.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Master (^Rash^) .
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Your servant, good deed law, Gentlewoman.
   [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] Master (^Plush^) .
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] My name is (^Plush^) ; Master my Title, and Sir, #
a Title,
that may be.
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] And my name is (^Gregory^) --
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] (^Fop^) : thy sound is out o' season. -- But     #
where's the Lady?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] I, where's the Lady?
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] Wee would see the Lady.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] I hope she has done mourning now, -- has she not?
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] Why, dos the Lady mourne?
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] Indeed shee dos.
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] Tis a delicate thing to mourne. -- Well, an my
Father wou'd but dye once!
Would we could see this Lady.
[$ (^Enter Barbara, like her Lady, arm'd in
by^) M. (^William^) .$] 
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] You have your wish already.
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Beautious Lady!
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] Most beautious Lady!
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] Most beautifull Lady, that may be: for yet, I see #
no
such matter.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] Thine eyes are veyl'd with ignorance, or else,
Through this thin veile, thou might'st, as we, -- behold
Matter of admiration! -- You'll vouchsafe; --
Not yet.
   [$ (^Bab.^) $] Alas: -- upon their Captive heart,
My sorrowes yet have set too strong a Guard
For such delights to enter.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] I could wish.
<P C1V>
That Conquerour of thy heart, and all his Guard
Were visible, that I might challenge them.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] I marry sir; that were a challenge indeed.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] Me thinks I could -- doe --
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] What, doe you think you could doe Sir?
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] O -- my most delicate Lady!
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] Doe, -- his -- most delicate Lady. -- A
terrible doe, indeed law.
   [$ (^O Gent.^) $] Well Lady; if this be the man shall have you,
You shall have a man, I can tell you.
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] If I be the man that shall have her,
Shee shall have a man, I can tell you.
   [$ (^O Gent.^) $] But, hee's a fighting man.
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] A fighting man? -- Let him play at the ancient
weapon, an he were a Fencing man, I'll have a Bout with him.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] The ancient weapon? -- What weapon's that?
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] Why this? [$ (^His hand.^) $] 
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] As wise, as valiant! 'tis the ancientst weapon   #
indeed Sir.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] And why not this? [$ (^His Rapier.^) $] 
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] I am better acquainted with this.
   [$ (^Plush.^) $] Well, wee shall meet?
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] And meet agen: -- Tell me of fighting Lady!
   [$ (^O Gent.^) $] I see you are valiant Sir; -- and you are happy
In having so much valour as you see
Attend your beauty.
   [$ (^Bab.^) $] I must confesse them, worthy Gentlemen;
But they must pardon me: -- the worth I ha' lost,
With my dead husband, is so full, and fresh,
Upon my understanding, that all else
Have yet but homely entertaine: -- And yet,
Y'are welcom Gentlemen. -- [$ (^All 3.^) $] For that, we thank you.
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] We must hope still.
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] Well, an my Father would but dye once!
I live in hope too Lady.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] You see their valour Sir: -- and what's your     #
weapon?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] I am no man of the sword, -- I have no weapon.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] How Sir? -- No weapon! -- [$M. (^Wil.^) $]     #
What should 
<P C2R>
you do in (^Cupids^) fencing Schoole, And have no weapon?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] There was a time, -- I could have crost a cudgell.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] And that you Sir?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Good sooth sometimes I can tell you: -- yet, if any
man strike me, I have a weapon too Sir.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] The coldest flint, has fire I see: What weapon?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] One, that is indeed, -- All weapons. --
Long-Sword; Sword and Dagger; -- Sword and
Buckler; Single Rapier, Rapier and Dagger; Case o' Rapiers;
Halbert, Halfe-Pike; Quarter-Staffe; Short-Sword and
Gauntlet; and that terrible Fly-flap, the Fauchion.
   [$ (^All.^) $] All these in one? -- [$ (^Rash.^) $] Or one that's #
worth all
these; -- and that, -- in a word, is the Law Sir.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] A terrible weapon indeed Sir.
   [$ (^Rash,^) $] There, let mee firk 'em, and jerk 'em: There, Let
mee stand upon Tearmes; -- There, Let me play the
Master, and M. Atturny, my Vsher, and then, -- with all the
weapons in that School, have at 'em. [$ (^En. Sir Rob. and Sir       #
Oli.^) $] 
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] This goes beyond your Rapier; or your ancient
weapon, the Fist. [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] Body o' me, my husband, and
Sir (^Oliver^) . [$ (^Bab.^) $] What's to be done? [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] #
Doe,
as thou hast done Wench. [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Play the Lady, a little
longer. [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] Handsomly (^Bab^) , and I'le promise thee,
it shall cost me a Chamblet Pettycoat.
   [$ (^Bab.^) $] I'll do't as well as I can then.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Come, come, we will speake, and speed too, my
Knight, of a thousand (^ (\per annum\) ^) , where's this mourning 
Lady? -- What, my (^Madona^) ? -- and my Lady Littleworth.
Hoyday? This (^Covy^) of Coxcombs too!
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Sir (^Robert^) . [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] One. --       #
[$ (^Plu.^) $] Kind Sir (^Robert^) .
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Two. -- [$ (^Greg.^) $] Worthy Sir             #
(^Robert^) . -- [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Three,
yet never a wise word amongst 'em. -- What, still in Dumbs,
and dolors? -- An ye were as heavy as Lead, 'twas but a light
trick of you to deny Accesse to such a brave man as this is, and
allow't to such Mimicks as these are. -- Death, I could kick
e'm out o' the roome. And you, though you bee my wives
sister, for lodging such basenesse within you.
<P C2V>
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Why, you are not out of your wits?
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] You have no wit to be out of. Gentlemen, you
are all -- Hobbyhorses. An it please you, to leave the house
now; and come agen, -- when you are sent for, -- you shal
be -- heartily glad, to be welcome.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] You see his humour Gentlemen; pray leave us.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] There's no resisting of him; for he has Rapier,  #
fist,

   [$ (^Bab.^) $] Never.

The Grave's the glasse they use to deck e'm by.
Pray give me leave.

A Glasse, shall shew thee better things; -- a Glasse,
That shall reflect, no such affrighting shadowes --

True, and essentiall comforts.

Only for terme of life, has no extent
O're the divorce of Death.
   [$ (^Bab.^) $] Pray, pray no more.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] That onely binds the living to the living,
And not the living to the dead.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] That flesh that has a soul within it, the      #
indowments,
And excellencies, bounteous Heaven bestowes,
To that, has nothing but the frightfull shape,
And key-cold figure of a man.

You doe sweet Lady; and this beauty bind

Is not the woman that you take her for;
Looke, doe you know this Lady?
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] How, Mistris (^Bab^) ?

   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] A trick o' mirth they put upon these Coxcombs.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Were you my Lady?
   [$ (^Bab.^) $] So, your Lady would have it, Sir (^Robert^) .
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Why, god-a-mercie faith.
   [$M. (^Wil.^) $] There's all the comfort they are like to have.

   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] My Lady (^Bab^) . -- How like you this Sir     #

   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] This change, has put some life into me Sir.
And I must tell you, betterd my opinion
Both of the Ladies wisedome, and her goodnesse.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] But heark you wife, may we not see my Sister?
   [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] Faith, yet her temper is not as Wee'd have it:
But we shall win her by degrees, and turne
Her melancholy to a sprightly humour.
<P C3V>
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] A day, or two dayes passage.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Come Sir (^Oliver^) .
Meane time wee'll see what mirth my house can yield
To entertaine you with. -- A ha, my Girle!
Why such a Wench is worth her weight in Pearle. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

   [$ (^Margaret.^) $] 
Sir, I have spoke my danger.
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] A dangerous case beleeve me.
And yet, me thinks, there's no great danger neither.
For, say a man offer to blowe thee up with Love-powder,
If his traine lie so open, you may see it, you have the wit I
hope to shun it; -- h'an't you.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] I have done hitherto.
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] And doest thou feare, -- thou shalt hold out no   #
longer?
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Sir, I doe not.
For, all the pollicies, and power he has,
Can ne're prevaile to conquest. -- No, tho feare
Be to our Sex a common attribute;
In such a fight as this, my resolution
Has that Heroick temper, I dare meet
My death, e're my dishonour: -- my dishonour!
For vertue's vertue, in what breast soere,
And her great splendour, equall.
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] Splend? -- Heyday!
But to the point, what is he? -- Do I know him?
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Yes, if you know Sir (^Robert Malory^) ,
Your Landlord Father.
<P C4R>
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] How Sir (^Robert^) ?
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] He. -- Sometimes, -- (tho clouded in a course     #
disguise)
He layes temptations to mine eare himselfe:
Sometimes by deputy; sometimes by Letters;
And sometimes by rich gifts. -- As if that Jemme
(Once gone) can never be bought back againe,
Were to be sold so basely. -- Here's my sore,
Assist me in the remedie.
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] Sir (^Robert^) !
He ayme against thy chastity? Alas.
Has he bestowed upon thine Infancie,
That care, and cost, that he has done? -- Maintain'd thee
Among his owne? -- Fed thee among his owne?
Apparrel'd thee, as he has cloth'd his owne?
In the same Schoole, in the same qualities,
Had thee instructed with his owne? -- Has he
So beautified thy mind? -- So grac'd thy body!
So many yeares in his owne house! -- And now --
(So close his favours follow thee) -- does he
Maintaine thee here? -- Here in this homely Roofe,
A starre to that poore glimmering candle light,
My poverty could afford thee! -- And for this,
Is this the best you can returne him?
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] No -- Father, for these should I forget to pay,
The most obsequious duties I can tender,
'Twere just in heaven I should forget my selfe.
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] Had this beene spoke of any other man.
I might have lent an eare to't: -- but, Sir (^Robert^) !
Noble Sir (^Robert^) ! -- that brave man, Sir (^Robert^) !
Our bountious Benefactor! -- Say he have
Scatter'd some words ith' way of merriment,
Some pleasant, idle, -- wanton, -- what d'yee call't?
Sprinkled a little Bawdry in his speech?
(As Courtiers may, and ne'r be question'd for it)
That cuts not off a Maydenhead. -- Nay, perchance
The merriment, that you interpret lust,
Was his meere love to vertue.
<P C4V>
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Vertue!
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] Yes. -- Tis my conceit, that all his talk, -- his
Letters, and all the gifts he sent thee, were imployed,
Ith' way of triall: -- Not to make thee naught;
But so to sound thy goodnesse.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Sound my goodnesse!
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] Not to o'recome thy chastity; but to try
If any other should assaile the Fort,
How stoutly  thoud'st maintaine it.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Think you so?
I'le think so too then Father: -- Let him try me.
But jest, or earnest, he shal ne'r come nye me. [$ (^Ent.            #

   [$ (^Gil.^) $] Why, this is fine, you have the golden time on't.
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] What golden time? -- You'll still be scolding.
   [$ (^Gil.^) $] Scolding! -- Mary come up Mistris Jinnie-Pinnie;
We cannot speak to you, but we scold. -- Well, I say little.
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] Nothing at all were better.
   [$ (^Gil.^) $] But I'll say something; Has a woman a tongue to say
nothing?
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Prethee be patient Sister.
   [$ (^Gil.^) $] Yes I waun't you. I must wash, and scowre; And
Brew, and Bake, and doe this thing, -- and doe that thing;
and doe every thing, while such a beautifull Blowse as you
are, must sit still o' your taile, and doe nothing.
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] Why, doest thou not see her at her work?
   [$ (^Gil.^) $] At work! -- A greate peyce o' work, a deed law!
[^SOURCE TEXT: At wotk! -- A geate peyce o work, a deed law!^] 
-- Prick, prick, prick. -- As if she had nothing in the
world to mind -- but Prick, Prick, Prick. -- But 'tis no

so you make me.

While hee's come in, and gone agen. --
<P D1R>
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] What leave?
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] To absent my selfe; -- but in some neighbours house:
I have a trick to passe him -- You may tell him,
I'm gone to London.
   [$ (^Abr.^) $] When I have told him already, you are here in the
Parlor a sewing.

To injure with such frivolous suspitions,
A Gentleman of his repute, and goodnesse!
Come, let me heare no more on't.

Nay, 'tis a Match; -- a Match upon a Wager.

to come neere her

And let his purposes, be what they can,
They cannot hurt thee. -- Look, hee's come already.

The Language of thy heart; thy heart, sweet (^Peggy^) .
What, still so adverse to my pleasure? -- Tennant --
And my young Tennant; -- shall I crave the Roome?
I have something to deliver from my Lady,
That she would have a secret to the Eare
Of any, But faire (^Margaret^) .
   [$ (^Thra.^) $] The Roome?
Our poverty possesses nothing Sir,
But what is yours; you may command it. -- Come.
   [$ (^Abra.^) $] I smell my Landlord; but, -- no words but mum.
[$ (^Exit Thrash, and Abram.^) $] 
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Still, still this cloud upon thy brow sweet    #

You know my minde.

Then there's some hope agen. -- Why, god-a-mercy,
Let's see how handsomly thou't give thy body
To my embraces Girle. -- How, fly e'm (^Peg^) ?
Not kisse me neither? -- such a thing deni'd,
How canst thou say thou lovest me?

I love you in your Name: your Reputation;
The dignity you carry in your yeares;
The goodnesse should goe with e'm; -- In your Lady;

You owe her vertues.

<P D2R>
Those Nuptiall vowes, that whilst you live should live
Unstain'd between you: -- In a word Sir (^Robert^) ,
I love you in that purity, -- that shall,
When death shall threaten your last minute to you,
Make you look boldly on him; smile upon him;
And in conclusion, seale you, one of those,
That, from this veyle of trouble, he conveyes
To th' purity of Angels: -- Thus, I love you.
   [$ (^Rob.^) $] This is not that I look for: heark you             #

Your Father is my Tennant.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Sir, he is.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Nay, since you vrge it, let me tell you Minion,
He's not my Tennant, neither; but my Beadsman.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] And like an humble Beadsman, in his Prayers
Remembers all your Charity.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] He does: -- But you forget it faire one.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Then let heaven,
Whence we Petition, the Reward it merits,
Forget me too.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Is't not forgetfulnesse
When all the love, -- the tender cares, and cost,
That from thy Infancie, to this Ripe groweth,
I have bestowed upon you, cannot gaine me
Such a request as this is!
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] This? Alas.
Your greatest gaine's in losing. -- Nay, I'le tell you,
The love, the care, -- that cost, that Noble breeding,
That seemes to you a winning Argument,
Is my best Argument against you.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] How?
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] Why Sir, the Education; -- that faire breeding
You have bestowed upon my poverty,
Has made me what I am: -- So copiously
Furnish'd my soule, with all that best adornes her,
That whatsoere's in opposition to't,
Has no admittance to her; -- Neere her; -- No, --
But, -- most deservedly, doe rank themselves
<P D2V>
With things, that most displease her. -- Such a thing, -- is --
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] What? -- My Love?
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] No, but your lust Sir (^Robert^) . -- I am bold,
But I can kneele to beg your mercy for it. [$ (^Kneele.^) $] 
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] What, she imagines water to my flame,
Is oyle t'encreas't: the more she puts me off,
The more she pulls me to her. -- Come, come rise,
Though you be so unkind; -- Come, prethee kis me. [$ (^Kis her.^) $] 
Why, God a mercy (^Peg^) ; -- agen, agen;
Why, this is somewhat yet: Wee must not look
At once, to have so great a happinesse
As that we ayme at. We must use degrees.
Lock me, once more, in thy embrace, and busse me,
And then. --
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] What then?
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] For this time (^Peg^) I'll leave thee. --
What, leave thee, and leave nothing with thee Wench?
Nay, that were foule play (^Peggy^) : there, -- Nay, take it.
Indeed you shall.

For any service, I can doe you Sir,
Your favour's price sufficient. -- No, not yet?

Almost at my fingers end. -- Look you Sir,
Will it please you. Bum this Cushion?

Goe, bring e'm in. [$ (^Whisper.^) $]

But, I beseech your pardon.

And seal't upon thy lip; -- Come prethee sit. [$ (^Treble within.^) $] 
Nay, nay, sit by me; -- Ne'r a stoole? -- Sit here then.

That now lye uselesse, their peculiar motion.
Nay, so that shapes imprest upon my soule,
That he appeares so really mine owne,

As, all the embraces of a second Match
Would stick upon me, like the leaprous staines

And in a Title, farre beneath your owne,
Prefer't, above all Title; though it came
Roab'd in the state of Princes. -- But --
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] No more.
I have my answer, and am married.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Married!
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] As you are Madam; never to be married:
Be that the witnesse of my Love.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Admir'd!
I should not be a woman, should I not
Love such a Love as this is!
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Doe you Lady?
Then, I revoke that Vow, and dare embrace you.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] But understand me Sir; I love your Love:
And -- as your selfe, have pleas'd to speak of me
Those singular Vertues, it is built upon:
That, I am fixt on; with that estimate,
That, next the memory of my dead husband,
It shall be my best comfort. -- Thus I love you;
<P E1R>
But, must not marrye.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] I ha' done. -- Yet Lady
In this; -- this purest, Imateriall things
There may be made a contract; and the assurance
Of such a Love, as this is, Interchang'd
And fairelie seald betweene vs.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Sir, how meane you?
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Fair'st, you have vowed your widowhood to the  #
grave,
At least, you have so protested: yet because
Our hearts, and purposes, are not our owne;
And, that no Bosome has that Constancie,
But Heav'ns may alter, the resolve it has,
And make it follow, what it fled; -- it may.
My Love Petitions, that if ere hereafter,
You find that alteration, in your soule, 
And againe Fancie Wedlocke, -- I -- your servant,
May - for that second hapinesse to heaven,
Stand fair'st in your Election.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] Pray no more.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Give my request an answer: -- If you doe.
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] A fruitlesse promise: and suppose it made,
This would but --
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] What? -- I vnderstand you Lady.
It shall not make me bolder, in my suite; 
Nor prompt my love, in any treacherous way
To gaine, what it so followes. -- No; I know
The man, would basely, compasse such a Ioy,
Like him that fishes with a poyson'd Bayte,
Infects the meat should feed him. -- fair'st, I wo'not;
Nor vex you with one syllable; but Live,
Vowed, like your selfe, till such a change shall be
To amorous Language, silent. -- Is it graunted?
If my best thoughts merit but this, expresse it
   [$ (^Lad.^) $] That satisfaction take. -- If ere I Marry
It shall be you; so helpe me heav'n.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] To which
I am rapt in this sweete tone. -- If ere I know
<P E1V>
The sweetes of Hymen, I must find 'em here;
So helpe me heav'n! -- So, we are maried now:
And in this Ioy I leave you. [$ (^Enter the Lady Malorie, and the    #
old Gentlewoman.^) $] 
   [$ (^La Mal.^) $] What Sir (^Oliver^) ? going
As we are entring?
   [$ (^O. Gen.^) $] Does your Lady, drive you hence with a frowne?
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] My smiles may tell you, here has bin no        #
frowning.
Shee's faire and noble; and in these sweet hopes,
That she has given me, I am pleased.
   [$ (^O. Gen.^) $] 'Tis well.
[$ (^Enter Sir Rob. Malorie.^) $]
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] A vengeance of all morrice dauncers
I am sure, they h'a mar'd, my dancing: that delicate dance
That I should have had with my tenant.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] All Ioy be with you Ladies; I must leave you.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Here's a rub in your way a while, my brave
Knight, of a 1000. (^ (\per Annum\) ^) .
And how do'st find her? -- is she comming? ha?
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] You see my hopes set smiles upon my cheeke,
Let them resolve you sir.   
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] I vnderstand you:
Why? god a mercy sister: when's the day?
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Nay, question that no farther, we shall talk   #
on't.
   [$ (^O Gen.^) $] When a things done, 'tis done.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] You'd faine be doing to then. [$ (^Enter Mr.   #
William.^) $] 
   [$ (^O Gent.^) $] Wo'd I not?
Do you think I am all dead flesh? -- I warrant you.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Now (^Mr. William^) ? -- what good tidings now #
sir?
   [$ (^Mr. Wi.^) $] My newes is, worthie sir, that (^Mullinex^)
That stout sea Captaine, is return'd from sea:
Is come to London, and that yesterday
He was upon th' Exchange.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] (^George Mullinex?^) 
   [$ (^Mr. Wi.^) $] That Gentleman: -- and but this morning Lady,
He was seene at the Phaenix, in fleet-street [^SOURCE TEXT:          #
fleeet-street^] .
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Body o' me I should have told you so -- but, I
Have such a Memory -- !
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] How i'st? -- ha? -- you lose colour Madam.
<P E2R>
   [$ (^O Gent.^) $] Lady. [$ (^La. Mal^) $] Sister
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Beshrew the name, and owner of that name
That has disturbed you. -- whats that name to you?
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] Sir, nothing but my trouble.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] A troublesome Captaine indeed sir,
A suytor once, in her virgin dayes
And Rivall to her husband, Sir (^Iames Mosely^) .
But, mis'd the marke he aymed at -- he shot faire;
But (^Mosely^) fairer. -- upon which, Sir (^Oliver^)
He went to sea; where having bin three yeares,
And now Returning, hearing, (as it seemes)
That she's a widow, hee'd renew his suite,
Give her a broad-side sir, and boord her! Nay
Yave a hot Ryvall, I can tell you that.
One that will Quarrel; -- fight -- and -- by my say --
I'm halfe afraid of danger.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] If he be not,
All valour, and no judgement, I feare none;
And yet, that heate, that has not judgement with it,
Cannot be counted valour, but a rash
Unknowing wildnesse, -- which I wo'not thinke
Him guilty of; -- But whatsoe'r he be,
I'll be, but what becomes me.
   [$ (^O. Gent.^) $] Leave the Roome.
   [$ (^La. Mal.^) $] Good truth now, but you shall not.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Leave the Roome? -- What feare you Lady?
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] I have cause enough,
For hee'll but trouble me with that, heaven knowes
I have no mind to heare of.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] If he have
No power upon you Lady by some promise,
Formerly past betweene you --
   [$ (^La. Mos.^) $] I had never,
That unprepar'dnesse in me, to doe that
In cause of such a Consequence as this,
And breake it sir.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] Such Beauty, and untruth
<P E2V>
Were ne're companions [^SOURCE TEXT: comoanions^] : 'tis beleev'd.
   [$ (^L. Mal.^) $] Come, come,
It may be, some new Beautie has him now:
Some Forraigne Mistris.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Or, it may be sister,
This time of service in the warres, had made him
Onely in love, with fighting.
[$ (^Enter Rash, Plush, and Gregorie.^) $]
   [$ (^La. Mose.^) $] More vexation?
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] This Mountaine, bring forth a Mouse!
Have we talk'd all this while of a Captaine,
And now, must be troubled, with Coxcombs?
   [$ (^Plu.^) $] The gods, protect you Lady.
   [$ (^O Gen.^) $] Thanke you sir.
   [$ (^Plu.^) $] I spoake to that sweet Beauty.
   [$ (^O gen.^) $] But I must speake to you sir; for you see she    #
has other imployment,
Pray, stand aside a little.
   [$ (^Plu.^) $] If I must -- I shall attend her leasure.
   [$ (^O Gen.^) $] You must attend her too sir: -- doe you not see,
shee's busie?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] I would not interrupt her.
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] I would not interrupt her? -- Is that the         #
resolution of a Lover?
Let me come to her.
   [$ (^Sir Oli.^) $] But, you shall not sir.
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] Why? if I shall not sir, -- I wo'not sir.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Is that the resolution of a Lover?
   [$ (^Greg.^) $] A man can do, no more then a can do,
But, an my father would but dye once!
[$ (^Enter Capt. Mullyneux rushing in by Mr. William and others.^) $] 
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Make nyce to me of entrance?
Where's the Widow?
For so I heare shee's now: what mourning still?
I'm a bold gamester: -- Save you all at once,
All suiters Gentlemen?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Yes indeed sir; we are all suitors.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Y'are a little too rash in that sir; I am none.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] And, what, are you sir?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] Why sir, -- I am, -- a Citizen, and a Mercer.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] A Citizen, and a Mercer, -- Cheapside?
<P E3R>
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] No Captain; -- but he's perfect in his Pater   #
noster.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] One of that row? -- I know't sir.
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Not very farre from it: -- In Creed sir.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Does he beleeve? that's seldome found in a Broker.
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] How sir, -- a Broker?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I know you, by this wheele. -- you have a great
many Bags, and a great many buildings to sir. -- But, dare
you for all that, presume in the way of Matrimonie, to looke
so high as a Lady?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] He that can purchase a Lordship --
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Thinks, he may purchase a Ladiship: -- you my     #
Rivall?
Can you fight sir?
   [$ (^Rash.^) $] It may be I, it may be no sir.
   [$ (^Cap.^) $] Then I'le try, whether you can or no sir. 
Not a word, as you love your Coxcombe. [$ (^Kicks him and thrust him #
out.^) $] 
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Nay, let him alone; let him alone, I beseech   #
you,
For hitherto he has done but Justice.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Are you a Suiter too sir?
   [$ (^Plu.^) $] Too sir?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Y'are an Asse sir: -- Can you fight?
   [$ (^Plu.^) $] Fight? in a Ladyes chamber?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Why, where would you fight sir?
   [$ (^Plu.^) $] Why, the truth on't is; -- I would -- fight, -- no #
where.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Why, I thought as much; -- and therefore, -- I will
kick you -- any where; good master outside of a 
Gentleman; follow your valiant Leader.
   [$ (^O. Gen.^) $] You will not kill him, will you? [$ (^Kick him  #
out.^) $] 
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Ha' you so much Tongue, and nev'r a good Tooth,
Madam Fumble!
   [$ (^O. Gen.^) $] Fumble, fumble! -- y'are a most --
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Peace, an you love your old Carkasse, -- peace.
   [$ (^La Mose.^) $] You bind me to a patience --
   [$ (^Sir Rob.^) $] Nay, good Sister: -- He does you a great deale #
a right,
And saves me a great deale of labour.
For I should have don't, if he had not.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] One post support another? -- What are you sir?
