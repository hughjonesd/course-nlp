[^THE NEXT THREE LINES ARE PRINTED TO THE LEFT

[$The foure 
womens 
names are, 
(^Abigail^) , the fathers ioy.
(^Eulalie^) , wel-spoken.
(^Xantip^) , a scold.
(^Margerie^) , a proud malapert.
(^Ben-ezer^) , an helper.$]
   [$ (^Eulaly.^) $] Good Morrow (neighbor
(^Xantip^) how do you to day?
did you see my gossip
(^Margerie^) ?
   [$ (^Xantip.^) $] No, I saw her not
to day: but mee thinks you are fairer
<P A7V>
then ordinary.
   [$ (^Eulal.^) $] What, do you begin to frump
me?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] No truly you seeme to mee to
bee very smug.
   [$ (^Eulal.^) $] Peraduenture my new gowne
sets a glosse on my face.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I promise you you say true
indeed, I haue not seene a goodlier a great
while: I take it to bee made of English
wooll.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] The wooll indeed is from
England, but it was died in Venice.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Truely it is a most gallant
gowne, the softnesse of it passeth silke:
and what a fine purple colour is it of?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] It is true, I like it well indeed:
but looke, who comes yonder?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] It is (^Margerie^) , whom you
asked for. Oh huge, how braue is shee?
you haue onely a new gowne, but shee
is new from toppe to toe.
   [$ (^Abigail.^) $] And yet, I feare me, her soule
is as old as (^Adam^) ; and as filthy as the
Serpent.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Where were you that we saw
you not before now?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] Little had you thought that I
<P A8R>
had bene so neare you, till you saw me.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] No, for if I had, I would not
haue sworne so, as I did.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] Alas I heard thee with griefe,
and thought to haue told thee of it at
time conuenient: but were you not
afraid lest God should see you, and heare
you sweare so horribly.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I know well, that God seeth
all things, but he is mercifull.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] And as he is mercifull, so also is
he iust.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Welcome ( (^Margerie^) ) welcome.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] God a mercie good (^Xantip^) ;
how dost thou?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Better to see you so fresh and
well liking; mee thinks you are too too
braue, your gown is most stately made,
your neckerchiefe is of the finest
cambricke, your stomacher is most 
gallantly wrought, and euery thing about you
is so in print, that it doth mee good to 
looke vpon you.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Woman, I may speake it
amongst vs here, I will haue it so.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] And the more is my griefe, that
I cannot haue it so too.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] I pray you neighbours talke no
<P A8V>
more of those things; why should wee
busie our minds so much about this
outward apparell, which onely sets out the
body, and many times makes vs forget
both God and our selues? Therefore I
pray you (good neighbours) let vs
regard this outward decking lesse, & the
inward adorning of our selues more.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] What shall wee haue of you?
a Puritane?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] I pray you (^Margerie^) , vse no
more such scoffing speeches.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] And I pray you (^Abigail^) tel
mee, doe you not thinke better of your
selfe, then of any of vs?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] If you aske me to be bettered by
my speech, I will tell you what I thinke
of my selfe.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Truly I do, (^Abigail^) .
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] I think in my conscience, that
I am a poore, sinfull, and miserable
woman, in my selfe not worthy to liue
vpon the earth; onely in and by Christ
Iesus, I hope to bee made eternally
happy.
   [$ (^Eulal.^) $] What, are you poore and
miserable? haue you not riches & the world
at will? and haue you not a louing
<P B1R>
husband, which makes much of you?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] Alacke (^Eulaly^) , thou art an
honest ciuill woman, I must needs say, but
yet thou speakest very carnally. What is
all my riches, if I had 10000 times
more then I haue, if that I bee not rich
in Christ Iesus? and what though I could
rule the whole world, which way I
would, if I haue not peace of conscience?
and what if I haue a louing husband, if
I haue not a good husband?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Are you not rich in Christ?
haue you not peace of conscience? and
haue you not also a louing and good
husband?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] Because you protested, that
you asked me to be bettered by me, I
will make my case knowne vnto you in
your eare. It is many times thus with me;
when I thinke vpon my riches, and the
aboundance of wealth, which God
hath bestowed vpon my husband and
me; then sathan suggesteth euill
motions in my heart, and my corrupt
affections break forth in my life, so that often
I thinke better of my selfe then I ought;
and that I may neglect to worke with
my hands, and that I may haue this and
<P B1V>
that fashion of apparell, because other
of my calling haue the same: and that
I may eate this dainty thing or that; and
that I may either sit vp idly in the night,
or lye longer then ordinary in the
morning. And on the other side, while I
thus pride my selfe in my apparell, and
walke idly out of my calling, and
pamper this sinfull carcase with delicious
fare, I haue not respect vnto some of 
my poore members, nay vnto Christs
members, as I ought. I speake this to my
shame, that selfe loue is so much in me,
which quenches the spirit of God, and
depriues me many times of his fauour,
and the excellent graces of his spirit, &
then my conscience is troubled and
disquieted; and then it is such a griefe
vnto me that I haue not a good husband,
howsoeuer I confesse indeed I haue a
louing husband.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] What meane you by a good
husband?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] By a good husband I meane a
religious husband, which should be my
partener, and helper, not onely in
bodily and worldly things, but especially
in spiritual and heauenly, that we might
<P B2R>
draw Christs yoke equally together:
that so in and through Christ wee might
bee glorified together. I tel you
neighbour, you will hardly beleeue, what a
comfort [^SOURCE TEXT: comfor^] it would bee vnto mee, if hee
would tender my soule as he doth my
body, nay if he would tender his owne
soule. Indeed he will not be against any
good thing I doe, I thanke God for it;
but here is my griefe, that he will not
bee partener of the good with mee,
which is the cause, when I am sicke or
afflicted in conscience, (as many times I
am humbled for my sins, I blesse God
for it) then, I say, he cannot minister
spirituall comfort to me. Onely this he wil
say, how dost thou wife? or God helpe
thee: which I take kindly: but alas it is
farre from that, which the Apostle
exhorts men vnto; namely, that they
should dwell with their wiues, as men
of knowledge; that is, if the woman be
ignorant as the most are, he should
instruct and informe her in the waies
of the Lord; if she heare any thing
preached, or at publicke
disputations, whereof shee stands in doubt,
shee should aske her husbands
<P B2V>
iudgement at home, and he should be able to
resolue her; he should be able through
God to comfort her in affliction, and to
reioyce with her in prosperity: I do not
meane any outward or fleshly ioy, so
much as that, which is spirituall and
heauenly.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] What is that, which you
two are whispering together of so long?
I doe not think but it was about some
religious matters, for (^Abigail^) loues
to talke of nothing else; & mee thought
I heard now and then a sound of some
holy words. My husband is much like
vnto her, they would haue bene very
well matched together.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] Me thinkes young women
should not flout at any, much lesse at
their husbands or elders.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I pray you gossip tell vs, what
is the practise of your husband, I haue
heard great commendations of him.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] I warrant you hee will not
misse a Sermon, yea many times he will
haue mee with him against my will,
when I had rather bee walking abroad
in the fields, or else sit and talke with
some of my neighbours: but sometimes
<P B3R>
I meete with him; for I am so long time
a dressing of me, that he is glad to go
alone, or else he should lose the best part
of the Sermon. And when hee comes
home, he wil pray, and make such a long
repetition of that which was preached,
& then such a seueral examination of
euery one concerning the points
deliuered, that my heart grudges many times
against him; and if it were not more for
shame of the world, then for feare of
him, I would tell him on both sides,
that he troubles both himselfe and vs
more then he needs. But sometimes I
get me out, as soone as euer we come in,
and other sometimes I lay the fault
vpon my memory, when he doth aske me,
when I could, if I would, tell him; and
then afterwardes hee goes to praier
againe, and euerie morning he will be
sure to haue vs together at prayer;
so after supper there must a chapter
bee read at the least; and euery one
must tell some thing, either what the
meaning of such a verse is, or at least
repeate some verse ouer that was read:
and then he goes to prayer againe, and
is so long commonly, that he make me
<P B3V>
so weary with kneeling, that sometimes
I am forced to sit, and sometimes to
leane and kneele againe, and sometimes
I am almost a sleepe; so that he makes me
wish many wishes, that I will not vtter.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] You haue vttered too much of
your own euil disposition; truly I
maruell that you & such as you are doe not
feare lest the ground should open her
mouth and swallow you vp, or the
house fall vpon your heades, or the
Diuell to fetch you quicke to hell,
for this intollerable profanenesse,
contempt, and abhominable
wickednesse; that it will not onely suffice you
to abuse your Christian husband, but
God also and his worship, in such a
horrible maner. I dare assure thee, it doth
grieue me at the heart; and if it were
not that I receiued some strength and
and comfort by the holy practise of your
husband, I thinke I should haue fallen
into a swound. Oh how doth it greeue
mee that such a good man is troubled
with such a bad wife! But seeing
nothing comes to passe without Gods 
[^SOURCE TEXT HAS COMMA AFTER Gods^]
prouidence, I hope it is onely to exercise
his patience, and that hee beeing crost
<P B4R>
heere with thee for a time, might liue
without thee in glory for euer.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Why, but mee thinkes you are
very earnest, and no lesse precise. It
would be irksome to any I thinke,
neuer to haue any pleasure, but to be euer
exercised, as shee said her husband was.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] I tell thee my deare (^Eulaly^) ,
that it iz the pleasantest & heauenliest
life in the world, the which doth solace
the soule, & reioyce the heart of a
Christian vnspeakeably; and there is no life
of God in them, which leade not this
life.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Why, but do you thinke none
shall bee saued but those that doe such
things?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] Verily I thinke, that
whosoeuer it is, that is ignorant of God & his
wil, and without faith, cannot be saued.
And againe, whosoeuer it is, y=t= knowes
the will of God, and will obstinatly
either contemn y=e= practise of it in others,
or neglect it in them selues, is in the
state of damnation.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Shee is euer of the minde of
Maister (^H.^)
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] I know, that it is not only our
<P B4V>
mind, but the mind of the holy Ghost,
and of all Christians, that are called
to the knowledge of Gods grace; and
I wish in heart, that it were your mind,
and if it pleased God, the minde of the
whole world. For if they did know
certainely, that all those that are
ignorant of God, or contemptuously will
scoffe at the practise of holy duties in
others, or neglect it in themselues, are
in the state of damnation, they would
soone change their minds, and say, We
fooles haue bene deceiued; and so no
doubt, many of neglecters will become
practitioners, and in steed of
contemners of Gods people, and their practise,
would become frequenters and louers
of their heauenly society.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I promise you, you say very
well, I thinke there bee but few women
can say so much.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Nay, will you beleeue me, I
thinke in my conscience, there are not
many me~ in our towne can say so much.
I wonder how you haue thus growne
in knowledge within these few yeares.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I promise you, the more that I
co~sider of her words, the more I maruel.
<P B5R>
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I will lay my life, that our (^sir
Iohn^) , nor (^sir William of B.^) cannot
say so much without booke; it is pitty
y=t= you were not coupled to a preacher.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] The greater is their
ignorance, and the more shall bee my
punishment, if my practise be not
according to my knowledge; & therefore my
heartes desire and prayer to God is, that
as hee doth increase in me knowledg, so
hee would giue me humility, and power
to obey, that which I know.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Indeed you say true. For I
remember our Sauiour Christ saith, that
he which knowes his maisters wil, and
doth it not, shall be beaten with many
stripes.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] O neighbour (^Eulalie^) , if you
would but practise that which you
know, I should loue you better then
euer I did: for then I hope you would be
a Christian indeed.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Why, what will you make of
me? haue you known me thus long, and
yet do you think y=t= I am not a Christia~?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] It is not such an easie matter to
be a Christian. But be not offended with
me, I will tell you what I thinke.
<P B5V>
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] What thinke you, I pray you
tell me?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] I thinke you be an honest
ciuill woman, and a Christian in name,
but not in nature and in deed.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Why, I was baptized, and go
to Church, and I doe not mocke at the
Preachers and professors, as some do;
I am neither whore nor thiefe; I pay
euery one their owne; I cannot abide to
sweare, &c. I hope you cannot accuse me
of deceiuing any, nor of lying: what
manner of people will you make
Christians?
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] Alas (^Eulalie^) , alas, I perceiue
you would be counted a Christian, and
that hitherto you haue thought your
selfe to be one. I must needs tell you
truly, that you haue scarce set one foote
in Christianity: for all which you haue
said, you may do, and yet bee damned.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Here is a sharpe sentence.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I pray you tell me the right
way, that so I may walke in the direct
path which leadeth vnto Christ; that so
I might become one with him, and an
heire of his kingdome.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] With all my heart. The first
<P B6R>
step is repentance, and faith in Christ
Iesus.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] What is repentance.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] The Diuines doe define it in
two words, mortification and
viuification, that is, a dying to sin, and liuing
to righteousnesse.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] And by what meanes must this
be wrought in vs.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] By the powerfull preaching
of the word of God, which breaketh and
softeneth the hard & stony heart,
humbleth the soule, and woundeth the
conscience for sinne which it hath
committed against the God of heauen, and
causeth it vnfeignedly to desire peace and
reconciliation with him in his Sonne
Christ; with a detestation of all the sins
which he hath committed, and a
resolution to leade the rest of his life holy
and vnblameably, as in the sight of
God.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] What is Faith?
[^NEXT SPEAKER NOT NAMED IN SOURCE TEXT: PRESUMABLY ABIGAIL.^]
   It is the worke of the Spirit of God
in vs, which doth assure vs of the free
pardon of our sins, and of the loue and
fauour of God in Christ Iesus, with all
the benefites that come with him; as it
<P B6V>
is written: It is the Spirit of God
that beareth witnesse vnto our spirits,
that we are the sonnes of God: and so it
is that spirit which causeth vs to
apprehend and apply the mercies of God in
Christ, and our selues, to the obedience
of his word.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I pray God that we may so do.
   [$ (^Abig.^) $] If you haue an vnfeigned
desire (as you seemed to me to haue) God
hath promised to giue you power, if you
will giue your endeuour therewithall:
and so I commit you to his grace.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yea but Gossip, I pray you tell
me, who gaue you this new gowne.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Your minde is more set vpon
my gowne, then vpon those heauenly
matters which (^Abigail^) spoke of.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] I will lay twenty shillings,
that (^Abigail^) hath almost made her a
Puritane.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] You thinke you may now talke
your pleasure; when shee was here, you
had not a word: shee tooke you downe I
trow.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I hope if you haue a new gowne,
we may without offence speake of it.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Shal I tel you how it is with me?
<P B7R>
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Yea.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Truly (^Abigails^) words were so
gracious, that I could willingly haue
heard her, though she should haue sate
with vs all this day; her words are so
sauoury to my soule, that me thinkes
we should not put them out of our
remembrance with these outward things.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Well (^Margery^) , if she will not
tel me who gaue her her new gown, do
you tel me what cost your neckerchiefe
a yard.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I thinke your minde runs thus
vpon these outward things, when you
are at praier and at Sermons.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] It is good to speake the truth;
it doth so indeed.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] That ought not to be by no
meanes: for thereby you much
dishonor God, and hinder your selfe, that the
word cannot profite you.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yea but will you tell me, who
gaue you your gowne?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Why, who, I pray you, should
giue honest wiues any such things but
their husbands?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] And I pray you (^Margery^) , who
gaue you yours?
<P B7V>
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] My husband also.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] O happy women that happen
on such husbands! For my part, I would
I had bene married to a toad-stoole,
when I maried with my (^Ben-ezer^) .
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] O fie woman, what a wish is
that? if (^Abigail^) had bene here, you
would haue vext her to the heart: and I
tell you truly, that you grieue me not a
little. For I remember well, what she
said, and I hope shall do, whiles I liue;
namely, that we which professe our
selues to be Christians, should adorne
the Gospell of Christ by our holy
conuersation. And againe, she said, that the
Apostle exhorts that our words should
be gracious and poudred, that they
might minister grace to the hearers.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yea you are happy, you haue
no cause to speake or complaine, that
haue all things you stand in need of.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] I thanke God we two do agree,
and I am sorry that you two cannot,
but that euery foote you are falling out.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I thinke I shall neuer fall in
with such a fellow: you see how
raggedly he lets me go: I would I were dead, if
I be not ashamed many times to go out
<P B8R>
a doore, when I see how finely other
women are dressed, that are married to
farre poorer husbands then mine is.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] Well (^Xantip^) , well, I pray thee
be contented; and if thou louest me, nay
if thou louest God or thy selfe, marke
well what our good neighbour (^Abigail^)
hath said out of the Apostle (^Paul^) , that
the woman ought to be in subiection to
her husband. And againe, the orname~t
of a woman lies not in gay apparell, or
in any setting out of herselfe to sight, as
S. (^Peter^) teacheth: for I remember that
I heard awhile ago at a Sermon, that
the ornament of a woman consisted in
chaste and honest conditions; and that
the ornament of the minds or soules of
godly women, was loue, meeknesse,
faith, and patience, &c. And further,
that it is the guise of drabs & harlots to
prancke and pricke vp themselues to
inueigle mens affections. Now then as
for vs, that would be counted honest &
religious matrons, we are neat inough,
if we be cleanly, and can please our
husbands.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yea, but this good man of mine
is such a niggard, that he will not allow
<P B8V>
me wherwithall I may go handsome, but
prodigally he spends my portio~, which,
though I say it, was no little one.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] If I were as thou art, I
would haue better things, or else the
house should be too hot for him. My
husband would not willingly let me haue
such and such a thing, but I trow hee
shall neuer goe to praier quietly, nor
haue a cheerefull looke till I haue it.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yea, but my husband doth not
only keepe me without such trim attire
as you haue, but he will not let me haue
that which is necessary, but spend that
we haue in tipling and swilling, at dice,
and cards, and amongst whores and
harlots.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] Good words, good words: I think
you surmise, and say more then is true.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] It is too true which I say; and
moreouer when hee comes home well
whitled in drinke at mid-night, after he
hath bene a long while waited for, hee
snorts like a swine when he is laied: and
sir reuerence casts vp his drunken gorge
in the bed, to say no more.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] O (^Xantip^) , you make my heart
ake to heare you. Therefore marke this,
<P C1R>
that when you doe thus disgrace your
husband, you shame you selfe.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I would I were dead, if I had
not rather sleepe with a sow, then lye by
his side.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] But do you rattle him vp at
his comming home?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yes, I handle him as hee
deserues, I make him know that I haue a
tongue in my head.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] And what saith he againe?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] At the first he is as loud as I,
thinking to beare mee downe with great
words.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] But do you neuer fall from
scolding to scuffing?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Once wee were fallen out so
farre, that a little more would haue made
vs fight out-right. Hee got vp a great
cudgell, and shaked it at me, threatning
me with thundering speeches.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] (^O lamentable liuing betweene man
and wife!^)
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Wast thou not afraid then
(^Xantip^) ?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Afraid? no: on the other side,
I tooke vp the treuit; and if he had but
touched me with a finger, he should wel
<P C1V>
haue seene and felt, that I would haue
laid about me lustily with both my
hands.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] I promise you, I commend
you for your manly courage; you had
got a new kinde of target, when you
had the treuit, you did but lacke your
distaffe in steed of a iauelin.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I would haue made him haue
knowne, that hee had met, and medled
with his match.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] O neighbour, this should not be
so.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] What tell you me of it? if hee
will not vse me as his wife, I will not
entreate him as my husband.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] But (^Paul^) , as I said before,
teacheth, that wiues should be in subiection
to their husbands with all reuerence,
and not to be check-mates with them:
and (^Peter^) sets downe (^Sarah^) for an
example to women, who called her
husband Lord.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] We haue heard of these things
before as well as you: but the same (^Paul^)
I trow, teacheth, that husbands should
loue their wiues, as Christ did his
Church.
<P C2R>
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Well, let him first do his duty,
and then I will do mine.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] But yet when the case stands thus,
I thinke it is the wiues part to yeeld first
to her husband.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Husband, quoth she, marrie in
good time; if he be a husband that makes
no more account of me, then of his
kitchin girle.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] But in kindnesse Xantip tell
me: did he, when you stood so stoutly to
him, leaue off to threaten you blowes?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Did he? yes, and it was best
for him too, I trow, or else as I am an
honest woman, I sweare to you, I
would haue belaboured my fellow well
and soundly.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] O terrible mannish woman! I
did not thinke that thou hadst bene of
such a peremptory spirit. Thou doest
not remember that he hath power ouer
thee, and that thou shouldest let thy
desire be subiect to thy husbands.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] It was well done (^Xantip^) ;
hold him out still at staues end, yeeld
him not an inch, lest he take an ell: let
him not crow ouer thee.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] You need not giue her such
<P C2V>
wicked counsell; what, will you haue all the
world to exclaime on our sexe, and cry
out vpon women kind?
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Why, none but men will
speake against vs; and if they do, we can
giue them two words for one in the
hottest manner.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Me thought you said your
husband left his threatning: me thinks then
(^Xantip^) , in all equity and conscience, you
should ceasse your scolding.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I mind not to leaue it yet.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] What does hee, I pray thee,
whilest thou art scolding?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] What? sometimes he sleepes,
slugge, as hee is; sometimes hee fals a
laughing; sometimes he takes his
fiddle, which hath scarce three strings, and
thereon he strikes with his fidling stick
as loud as he can, that hee may
therewith drowne the noise of me.
   [$ (^Mar.^) $] I am sure, this behauiour of
his angers thee to the heart.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] It grieues me indeed to the
very guts, and I so chafe sometimes that
I can hardly hold my hands.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I pray you good neighbour
hold your tounge, and giue me leaue to
<P C3R>
speake my mind a little to you.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Say on hardly, and speake
your pleasure.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] You shall be as bold with me
when you please: me thinkes we two
for old acquaintance sake should be
very bold & familiar one with another.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] You say true. For truly we
haue bene play-fellowes from our
cradles; and of all that euer I had, there
was none that euer I loued better then
you.
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] Well then, this I say in loue that
I haue towards you still, and my request
is euen as you loue me, to hearken vnto
me. You are maried now vnto your
husband, what manner of man soeuer hee
be, you haue no liberty to change him
for another, or cast him off. In old time
indeed, when couples could not agree,
diuorcement was permitted &
appointed as an extreme remedie, but now that
is quite abolished. (^Ben-ezer^) must bee
your husband, and you (^Xantip^) his wife,
till one of you dye.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] A vengeance on them,
whosoeuer they be, that haue taken away that
law and liberty from vs.
<P C3V>
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Take heed what you speake, you
wot not what you say, nor whom you
curse. It is Christs pleasure I tell you,
& no other mans, that it should be thus
hence-forth.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I can hardly beleeue it.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Truly (^Xantip^) it is as I say, and
therefore cry Christ mercy for thy
cursed blasphemy, and study to agree
with thy husband henceforward, by
applying thy selfe vnto his
qualities.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Is it in my hands to make my
husband a new man?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I can tell you (^Xantip^) , wee wiues
may do much either in making or
marring our husbands.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Do you and your husband agree
so well together?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Yes, now, God be thanked, wee
liue in peace.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] By your owne saying it seemes,
that you could not well agree
heretofore.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I must needes confesse to thee,
though I take shame to my selfe, the
fault most commonly was mine. For I
was, as many other yong women are,
<P C4R>
proud & disdainfull, scorning that my
husband should reproue mee; idle and
carelesse, seldome, or neuer, seeking to
please him; but rather thought that hee
should stoope and seeke to me; [^---^]
[^THE REST OF EULALIE'S SPEECH OMITTED: SHE SAYS THAT WOMEN HAVE 
TO BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT THEY SAY.^]
<S SAMPLE 2>
<P C5V>
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I promise you, I like your speech
passing well. Well, now I wish in my
heart, that I, and all other women in
the world, were of your minde: we may
see what it is to keepe company with
those that are wise and godly. I thinke
our neighbour (^Abigail^) did you more
good then euer any woman did; and I
thank God, you haue done me more good
then euer any woman hitherto hath
done.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I reioice greatly that God hath
<P C6R>
made me an instrument to doe you any
good, or any other. And this I pray you
neighbour, if there bee any good done
vnto you by me through Gods mercy,
shew the fruits thereof in a holy life.
For I may tell you, be it spoken now to
the glory of God, there were few that
euer thought you would haue bene
reclaimed, you were so lauish of your
tongue, and so fierce, that you would
haue scared one with your words.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] We may see the power of the
Almighty, who can make of the lyon a
lambe, and that a little child should play
vpon the hole of the aspe: and therefore
I pray you, pray vnto God for me; yea
and that also, when you are met 
together with (^Abigail^) , and the rest of your
Christian friends, that God would go
on with his good worke which hee hath
begun in me.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] That is my duty. And to
forget you in my praier, were to forget my
selfe vnto God. I pray you also, take all
the means that may helpe you forward,
& renou~ce whatsoeuer may hinder you.
You heard what holy and heauenly
exercises (^Margeries^) good husband vsed;
<P C6V>
vse you the same, though shee neglected
and loathed them. In any case cashiere
her company, and the fellowship of
such, til you be stro~ger, or she better: for
now she is a perillous woman, her euill
words and rotten speeches will corrupt
good manners, and quench your good
motions: her religious husband is much
vexed with her, euen as iust (^Lot^) was
with the vncleane Sodomites. And
againe, I am to aduise you, not to be
dismaied for those that will mocke you for
your profession, and because they see
you begin to make conscience of your
carriage, who vse to say, that we are a
holy sister-hood, and precise foolish
women; which prattle and chat wee
know not what. Beare them with
patience, and bee slow, yet sure, when you
speake, especially in the cause of Christ.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Blessed bee God for this your
loue and good counsell: I hope I
shall make vse of it, as God shall enable
me. I pray you now shew me some
particular directions [^SOURCE TEXT: directious^] how I and my
husband may best liue together in mutuall
loue.
[^EULALIE'S LONG SPEECH OMITTED.^]
<S SAMPLE 3>
<P C8R>
   [$ (^Xantip.^) $] Good gossip, tell mee, what
way went you to worke to win your
husband?
   [$ (^Eulal.^) $] I told you a little before: but
to the end, that you may the better
remember it, and follow me, I wil tell you
againe.
   [$ (^Xantip.^) $] If I can, I will doe my
endeauour to the vttermost, through the
helpe of God.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I make no doubt but that God
wil strengthen you to any good worke,
<P C8V>
if you call vpon him for his aide, and
take those meanes which hee hath
appointed for the accomplishing of the
same.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Well, I will.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] First then this was my care;
when hee was pleased, how I might
keepe in with him: and when hee was
angrie, how I might appease him. And
this was one maine thing that I would
continually aime at, to behaue my selfe
humbly and meekly towards him, both
in word and deed; also I would carry
my selfe cheerfully toward him, and I
would looke vp and downe, that there
should bee nothing that might offend
him. I also obserued his diposition
and inclination. Moreouer I had respect
vnto times and seasons, that his diet
should bee prouided in due time; and
that he should haue such delicates, as
were most comfortable for his heart, and
pleasant to his mouth; and so by this
meanes I won both him and his loue
vnto me; whereas before me thought
he was as cruell as a Lyon, and terrible
as a Dragon. Therefore I considered
what those do that take in hand to tame
<P D1R>
Lyons, and Elephants, &c. which
cannot be mastered with strong hand;
therfore they that goe to the Elephant haue
a speciall care that they bee not clad in
white; and they that goe to Buls, that
they be not araied in redde; because it
hath bene found by experience, that
those creatures by these colours, are
made wilder and fiercer; and also
Tigres by the sound of Timbrels, by
report are so enraged, that they rend
themselues in peeces; So they that
breake horses haue their tearmes, their
smackings, whistlings, and clappings,
whereby they make their stout nature
tame. Why then (^Xantip^) consider I pray
you, how much more seemely and
necessary it is [^SOURCE TEXT: it^] , that we women should
acquaint our selues with such courses,
whereby we may win our husbands to
goodnesse; by whom we should haue
the greatest comfort and defence next
vnder God.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] It is true: say on, I pray you,
say on.
   [$ (^Eulal.^) $] Hauing obserued these things,
I applied me to his nature, and I had
great care that nothing should be done
<P D1V>
that might displease him; nor nothing
left vndone, that might offend him.
Not onely of my selfe had I this care,
but of all that was in in [^SO IN SOURCE TEXT^] the house; and
that not onely in great matters, but also
in the least
   [$ (^Xantip.^) $] But how would you apply
your selfe to him that would neuer
tarry within doores, or come euery while
drunken home?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Stay a while, I will speake of
that by and by. First I will shew you
forth my behauiour towards my
husband, because you desired to know it.
When he lookt at any time very sad, &
there were no fit time to speak to him, I
would not the~ laugh & dally with him,
and play the tom-boy, as many women
are wont to doe in such a case, but I put
vpon me a sad countenance also, and
lookt heauily; for euen as a looking
glasse if it be a good one, doth shew the
countenance of him that glasses himselfe
in it: So it beseemes an honest wife to
frame her selfe to her husbands affectio~,
and not to be merry, when he is
melancholy, nor iocund, when he is sad, much
lesse stire when hee is angry. And if at
<P D2R>
any time he were stird, I would either
pacifie him with gentle speech, or giue
way to his wrath, till it were somewhat
alayed; or else I would keepe silence, til
there were fit time for clearing my selfe,
or aduising him with reuerence and
discretion. This course also I tooke; if
at any time he came drunken home, I
would not then for any thing haue giue~
him a foule word, but I would cause his
bed to be made very soft and easie, that
he might sleepe the better, and by faire
speeches get him to it.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Heere are fetters for the legs,
and yoakes for the neckes of women:
must they crouch on this manner to
their currish and swinish husbands? If
I had such an one, as he behaued
himselfe like a swine, so I would vse him
like a beast.
   [$ (^Eulal.^) $] I had thought we had bene
ridde of your company.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] I stood behind, and heard
you so long, that I could no longer hold
my peace. Are you a woman, and make
them such dishclouts and slaues to their
husbands? Came you of a woman, that
you should giue the~ no prerogatiue, but
<P D2V>
make them altogether vnderlings?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I pray you be patient: I haue
spoke nor counselled any thing but
what I haue done my selfe; and I haue
done nothing, but that which is
warranted by the word of God.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] I hope the word of God
doth shew men their duties to wiues,
as well as the wiues toward their
husbands.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] It is so: but first wee must shew
the one, before we can doe the other.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] You should haue begun with
the men first.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] It might haply haue bene
somewhat tedious, and women mostly are
so fickle, and wil find themselues so
many things to doe, & are so soone weary
of hearing and reading any good thing,
that they would scarce stay to heare the
beginning of their dutie; therefore I
thought best to begin with them first.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Trust me, you are a small
friend to your owne sexe.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] More then you are to your owne
selfe; for you are ignorant and carelesse
of that good, which you might haue by
your husband, if you would be louing
<P D3R>
and submissiue to him.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Tell not mee of the good,
which I may haue by my submissio~; for
this is the truth of it, I care not though
he heard me: I neuer meane to haue
my necke brought vnder his girdle, but
I will rather make him buckle & bend
vnto me, or else he shall haue an
vnquet life.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] It is true indeed, that many such
as you are wil haue their husbands bend
and crouch vnto them. But how seemly
or warrantable this is, let euery one
iudge. It is neither for the womans
credit nor profit, whe~ the streame runs with
violence this way. What a horrible sinne
is it, that the woman should vsurpe the
mans authority, & the poore man dares
not do any thing, but what his wife wil?
and as she saith so it must bee, or else the
house will not hold her, neither will she
looke vpon him without lumping and
lowring; & if any describe the vglines of
her countena~ce in the time of her anger,
she will scarce be friends with them. Oh
therfore, Oh therefore, that these
masterly dames would but glasse
themselues, that they might see their rugged
<P D3V>
browes, their fiery eyes, pouching
mouthes, their blacke and poysoned
tonges, which vtter horrible
blasphemies both against God and men,
especially against their husbands, whom
they should loue most dearely. So heere
is the cause why many men thinke it
their greatest wisdome to possesse their
soules in patience, and to passe by
many grieuances in our sexe. Onely this
is the refuge of those that are godly, to
comfort themselues in the Lord their
God. Therefore well (saith (^Salmon^) ) (^It
is better to liue in the wildernesse with a
dinner of greene hearbes, then to haue a stalled
oxe, or to liue in a wide house with a
contentious woman^) .
    [$ (^Marg.^) $] I will be sworne, if there
were but three or foure moe here; if they
were of my mind, wee would teach
you how to defame & shame vs on this
manner.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] You defame and shame your
selues, I onely shew, what shrewes are:
and those that will neither be ruled by
God nor their husbands: as he that
toucheth not pitch shall not be defiled, so
she that is not of this stocke and linage,
<P D4R>
[^SOURCE TEXT, ERRONEOUSLY B4^] 
is not blamed.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Let her alone good (^Eulaly^) , and
tel me how did you after your husband
was in bed.
   [$ (^Eulal.^) $] When his stomack was
emptied, and he come to himselfe, when he
was not stirred in his affections, nor
troubled with other actions, but he and
I alone, either in bed, or in some
conuenient place, I would gently admonish
him, or rather intreat him, that he would
haue a care of the health of his body, &
to auoid that sin, to bee ouercome with
drinck; telling him of such young men,
yea gallant gentlemen as he knew, who
got surfets by so ouercharging their
stomacks: also with weeping eies I would
intreat him, to haue a care of his estate
and credit, children and seruants, lest
the one should be vndone by his
spending their portions, and the other by
following his vnseemely course of life.
This was the manner of my proceeding
with him, seasoning my speeches in the
best manner, that they might not be
distasted but digested of him. Also
sometimes I was wont to vse a preface, and
make him promise mee, that hee would
<P D4V>
haue patience with me, if I a simple
woman should put him in minde of
something, that might tend to his credit or
welfare any way; & whe~ I had told him
my mind, I would breake off that talke,
and fall into some other more delightful
to him. For gossip (^Xantip^) , I may say to
you, that this is the weakenes of vs
women, that when wee haue begunne to
speake, wee are so talkatiue and full of
words, that wee wot not when to leaue.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] It is the pleasure of men
indeed so to say to vs, who haue no better
sport, then to speake of, and report our
infirmities: but say on I pray you.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] I had also a speciall care of this,
that I would not find fault with my
husband for any thing, in any bodies
presence, nor complaine of him
abroad. A matter is soone amended, that
is but betweene two, and not blazed
abroad. But if the matter bee of such a
nature, that it cannot well be holpen by
the wiues counsell, it is a seemelier
course that the wife make complaint to
her husbands parents, or some of his
kindred, rather then to her owne; and
also that she moderate her complaint &
<P D5R>
te~per her speech so, that she may seeme
not to hate her husbands person, but
only his ill conditions. Neither let her blab
out all; that so, when her husband
comes to heare of it by his friends, that
she hath spoken of his faultes with the
least, he may be forced to acknowledge
his wiues courtesie, and kind dealing, &
to say as (^Saul^) did of (^Dauid^) : (^She is more
righteous then I^) .
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] She had neede be an
Academick, and brought vp in their schooles
and Vniuersitie, that should skill to do
this as you haue set downe.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] By this meanes we shall draw
our husbands to shew vs the like
kindnesse.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] There are some husbands,
whom no gentle intreaty will doe any
good.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Truely I thinke, there are few
or none such: but say there be; first of al,
as I haue said before, the husband must
be borne, endured, and dwelled with,
though neuer so wretched and wicked,
euen a diuell incarnate. Therefore it is
farre better to beare with one like our
selues, or that may bee bettered by our
<P D5V>
courteous carriage, then one, that will
be worse euery day then other, by our
ouerthwart & crabbed behauiour. Come
on (^Margerie^) , what will you say, if I tell
you of some husbands, that haue
reformed their wiues on this wise by their
gentle carriage. If they doe it, how
much more the~ is it meet, that we should
do the same to our husbands?
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] If you can tell vs of a truth of
any such, I say they are rare swans, and such
husbands are hard to come by.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Why, there are many such geese
as you are, will not bee ruled by them,
but continually will bee gagling at
them.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Shee hath such a swanne her
selfe; if she had eyes to se him, or grace
to make vse of him: I would I had such
another; if I had, I would thinke I had
a rare Iewell.
[^EULALIE'S LONG SPEECH (ABOUT A HUSBAND WHO REFORMS HIS WIFE)

<S SAMPLE 4>
<P D7R>
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] And what followed?
<P D7V>
   [$ (^Eu.^) $] The young woman going from
her father, returned to her chamber,
finds her husband all alone, fals vpon
her knees, & cried: O husband, vnwise
as I was, I haue not hitherto knowne
you nor my selfe: hereafter you shall
see me become a new woman: only good
husband forgiue and forget my former
disobedience. This vnexpected humble
speech of his wife, hee welcomed with a
kisse, and promised her all things, if shee
would still continue in this minde.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yea, but did she so?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Yes to her dying day; neither
was there any seruice so base, which shee
would not willingly vndergoe at her
husbands pleasure, howsoeuer (^Margery^)
it may be, you would haue done it at
your leasure. And there grew euery day
such great loue betwixt the~, that within
few yeares she would often in company
reioyce & blesse God that shee was
matched with such a husband, whom if shee
had not maried, she thought there should
not haue bene a more miserable
creature vnder the Sunne.
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Such men as these are as rare
as white crowes.
<P D8R>
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yet you haue such an one?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] The greater shall her iudgment
be, except she repent: for there are few
women in the country, I can tell you,
that haue such a religious husband, who
seeketh by all meanes her saluation.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Haue you no mo such exa~ples?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Yes, that I haue, and one
especiall one, which I hope will please
(^Margery^) , it being much in the
comme~dation of a woman, as the other was of a
man.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I pray you let vs heare it.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] There was a neighbour of ours,
a very honest man, but somewhat of a 
hastie nature, and of a waspish & tetchy
disposition: on a day he beate his wife,
a woman, by common report, of
singular good carriage, and excellent
behauiour, such an one as (^Abigail^) , being
very well beloued of all her neighbours.
Being beaten & abused of her husband,
she betakes her selfe into her secret
closet, and there shee sits sighing and
sobbing, so easing her heart, and disgesting
her griefe. Soone after vpon occasion
her husband went into that roome, and
finding his wife wofully weeping, saies
<P D8V>
to her: Why sittest thou here sighing &
sobbing, and crying, like a child? Shee
then thus prudently and patiently
answered: Husband, said shee, is it not
better to doe thus, here to bewaile my
griefe where no body heares nor sees,
then to runne and cry out in the streetes,
and to exclaime on you, as others do on
their husbands? By this wise and
gentle speech of his wife, the stout heart of
her husband was broken: hee gaue her
his right hand, and promised that hee
would neuer touch her againe in any
euill manner; neither did he.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I haue brought my husband to
that passe too, but yet another way then
she did.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] But I thinke you [^SOURCE TEXT: yon^] cannot yet
agree.
   [$ (^Xantip.^) $] Why, what would you haue
me to do?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] O (^Xantip^) , how oft haue I told
thee how thou shouldst behaue thy selfe
to thy husband? I perceiue thou hast a
bad memory, or at least, small list to
learne, sith so soone thou forgettest thy
duty. Wel, once more I wil tel thee. First
you must put vp all iniury at his hands.
<P E1R>
   [$ (^Marg.^) $] Yea, so one might soone bee
made a foole & a foot-stoole: I would
rather do him two for one.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Hold you your tongue
(^Margery^) , I speake not to you but to (^Xantip^) .
Then (^Xantip^) you must labour to win his
good will by doing all duties with
chearefulnesse, and louing kindnesse: so
shal you at last ouercome him, or at least
you shall haue him in a farre better
temper then he is in at this present.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Alas woman, he is farre
fiercer then he was before: I feare me, no
gentlenesse will preuaile with him.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Feare not woman, there is no
wild beast so sauage, but by gentle 
handling it may be tamed: be not then
hopelesse of a man; do but put in practise &
vre my aduice for a few moneths, and
then blame me, if you find not my
counsell to doe you good. There are some
smal faults which you must winke at; &
take heede that you giue no occasion of
contention, and thinke no scorne to be
seruiceable in those things which
become you. There are some women that
will be euer frumping or whining,
seldome or neuer vsing any amiable
<P E1V>
behauiour toward their husbands, which is a
signe that they haue not the loue of God
shed abroad in their hearts. For if they
had, it would cause them to loue their
husbands vnspeakeably.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Indeed gossip, I must tell you
plainly, I cannot shew that loue to my
husband that I should, and some do to
theirs, he is so crosse to me, and euery
way so vntoward.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] But I hope it would bee for your
good, if hee would leaue his bad 
qualities: suppose when you are angry with
your husband, that then you could by
the art of (^Circes^) transforme your
husband into a swine, or a Beare, or any such
like beast, would you not do it?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I know I should not: but
whether I would yea or no, its hard to say.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] What, had you rather haue a
swine or a Beare to your husband then a
man?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] You doe not heare me say so;
I trow, no.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Go to then, what if you could
make him of a wine-bibber, a sober
person; of a ding-thrift a good husband; of
a slothfull, a painefull person; of a
<P E2R>
prophane creature, a religious and zealous
Christian, would you not do it?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] There is a question indeede.
Yes, with all my heart would I: but
how should I do it?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] (^Xantip, Xantip^) , thou art like vnto
those women which the Apostle speakes
of, that are alwaies learning, and are
neuer taught: so thou art alwaies asking
how shal I do this and that, and yet thou
remainest still ignorant: and wilt thou
know why thou art so ignorant still, and
forgetfull?
   [$ (^Xan.^) $] Yes, with a good will.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] It is because you do not practise
that which is taught you. I shewed
before to you, that you must adorne the
Gospell of Christ by your holy
conuersation. Now if you be a Christian, as I
thought you were, & I suppose you think
no lesse of your selfe; of you the Apostle
askes this question: What knowest thou
o` wife, whether thou shalt win thy
husband? meaning, by thy holy example,
gracious words & counsell, praiers and
patience, your conference and
community. Now if by any meanes you can win
your husba~d, what a rich crowne of
<P E2V>
glory shall you obtaine? what
vnspeakeable ioy and comfort shall you haue both
in this life, and in the life to come? Set
not your eies so much vpon his ill
conditions: for that makes them seeme
greater then they be; and to twit him with
them, is not the way to bring him to
goodnesse, but to make him worse.
Before you were maried to him, you shold
haue considered what his ill qualities
were: for it behoues a woman not
onely to chuse a husband by her eies, but
also by her eares, and by experience of
his qualities; neither is it a time after
once they be maried, of complaining &
accusing, but of curing their bad
husbands.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] What woman knew you euer,
that chose her husband with her eares?
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] She chuses a husband with her
eies, that respects nothing but his visage
and personage: and she chuseth him by
her eares, that warily & wisely weighes
what the world, especially the best sort,
say of him; and she chuseth him by
experience, who trieth his loue and
constancy.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] This is good counsell, but
<P E3R>
it is all too late.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] But it is not too late to labour the
reformation of your husband; and yet it
shall be in very good time, if you can
profite your husband. For the way to
good manners is neuer too late; and you
both shall finde a double comfort of it,
if your husband shal haue any children
by you.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] I haue one already.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] When, I pray you?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] A pretty while agoe:
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] How many moneths since?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Welneere seuen.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] How can that bee? Is it possible
that you should haue a child in three
moneths?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Tush, it is longer.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] It is not a day longer, if you
beginne your reckoning from the mariage
day.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yea, but we had conference
before.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Like inough; but I hope
children are not gotten with conference. Is
this you that co~plaine of your husband
so much? I perceiue one house is better 
troubled with you then two. I feare I
<P E3V>
haue bestowed all my labour in vaine
vpon you! what thinke you will our
neighbour (^Abigail^) say, when she heares
of this? it will grieue her not a little.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] We were sure together before.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] The sin is something the lesse, but
yet except it be repented of, and that
from the heart, God will punish you
both for it; and therefore looke to it, &
lament it, as also all other your
misdemeanors. What is it, a boy?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] Yes, a goodly lad, God blesse it.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] You must haue a speciall care to
bring him vp in the feare of the Lord;
otherwise make your reckoning that hee
will be a great crosse to you both: but if
you wil catechise him now from his
cradle, & so co~tinually, no doubt but he wil
be a meanes to set you at one, if that you
will but incline a little to your husbands
minde. I pray you tell me, what do other
men say of your husband, your
neighbours, and those that haue dealing with
him?
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] They commend him out of all
cry for a courteous, liberall, and friendly
man.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] This makes me hope that he will
<P E4R>
proue such an one as we would haue him.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] But I am sure that I find him
not such an one to me, whatsoeuer they
say.
   [$ (^Eul.^) $] Yea but do you shew your selfe
such an one towards him, as I haue
counselled you; and if he proue not such an
one in time as I said, call me (^Eulalie^) no
longer, but (^Pseudolalie^) , or lyer.
Moreouer remember, that yet he is but a yong
man, not, as I thinke, aboue foure and
twenty yeares old; alas poore soule, he
knowes not yet what belongs to a
husband or housekeeping. You must not
thinke to bee separated from him, as a
great many do, if so bee they cannot
agree vpon euery thing, then straight
nothing but separation.
   [$ (^Xant.^) $] God forgiue me, I haue often
wished it.
