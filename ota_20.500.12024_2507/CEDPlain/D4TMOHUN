   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Pray call your Witnesses together, and   #
let me know who you begin with.
<P 12>   
   [$ (^M. At. Gen.^) $] My Lords, We do not know what Place is      #
designed for the Witnesses; but if they 
are to be on the other side, and this Croud do interpose between us  #
and them, it will be
impossible for us, who are the King's Council, to hear what they     #
say, or know how to proceed.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] There must be Room made there for    #
the Witnesses; where are your
Witnesses Mr. (^Attorney^) ?
   [$ (^Clark of the Crown,^) $] If you please to name them Sir, we  #
will call them.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Call Mr. (^John Hudson^) , and Mr. #
(^George Powel^) .
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] I know not how this is ordered, but  #
way must be made there by the Bar,
that the Prisoner may see the Witnesses, and they him.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Yes my Lord, by all means.
   [$Mr. (^Serjeant Tremaine.^) $] If your Lordships please, the     #
Witnesses will be most Conveniently heard,
if they come and stand here by us. 
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] If your Lordships please, it will  #
not be possible either for my Lord at 
the Bar, or for us to hear what the Witnesses say: Unless they be    #
brought into this place to 
stand between us.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] My Lord Great Chamberlain, be        #
pleased to give order for them to be 
brought in thither.
[$Then the Lord Great Chamberlain went down to the Bar.$]
   [$ (^Lord Great Chamberlain.^) $] The Witnesses must be brought   #
to this place.
   [$And accordingly, way was made for the Witnesses, as called to   #
stand at the Bar between the
Prisoner and the Kings Councel.$]
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Give me the Name of him that you     #
begin with.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] We begin my Lords, with Mr.        #
(^John Hudson^) , [$who came to the Bar, and 
one of the Clerks held the Book to him, upon which he laid his Hand.$] 
   [$ (^Clerk of the Crown.^) $] Hearken to your Oath Sir, the       #
Evidence that you shall give on the behalf of 
our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queens Majesties, against   #
(^Charles^) Lord (^Mohun^) the
Prisoner at the Bar, shall be Truth, the whole Truth, and nothing    #
but the Truth: So help you
God.       
[$Then he kissed the Book.$] 
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Mr. (^Hudson^) , Do you give my    #
Lords an account what you know of any
Applications of Courtship made to Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) by Mr.        #
(^Hill^) , and what became of it; and what 
you heard (^Hill^) say about her, or about any one else Relating to  #
that matter.
   [$ (^Hudson.^) $] My Lord, I had the Honour to be invited to      #
Supper with my Lord (^Mohun^) , at the
(^Rose-Tavern^) in (^Covent-Garden^) , where I found Captain         #
(^Hill^) with his Lordship.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] When was this Sir, tell the time.
   [$ (^Hudson.^) $] This was three Nights before this unfortunate   #
Accident hapned, there I found
Captain (^Hill^) , and we supped together; and after Supper,         #
Captain (^Hill^) raised a Discourse of Mrs.
(^Bracegirdle^) and Mr. (^Mountford^) ; says He, I should not doubt  #
the Success of my Amour with Mrs.
(^Bracegirdle^) , if I were not obstructed by (^Mountford^) , whom I #
design to be the Death of: This is
Truth upon my Oath. My Lord (^Mohun^) was in the Company; but I      #
cannot say that my Lord
made any Reply to the thing, or took any notice of it: But this      #
Captain (^Hill^) did say, not only
then, but several times before.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Did he say it at any other time in #
your Hearing.
   [$ (^Hudson.^) $] Yes, several times before
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Do you know any thing more of this #
matter.
   [$ (^Hudson.^) $] No more, than that my Lord (^Mohun^) that very  #
Night that Mr. (^Mountford^) was killed,
and Captain (^Hill^) came into the Scene-Room of the Play-House, and #
my Lord (^Mohun^) had Captain, 
(^Hills^) Coat on, and Captain (^Hill^) had my Lord (^Mohuns^) Coat  #
on, and they changed their Cloaths 
in the Play-House. I saw them change their Cloaths; but what their   #
Design was, I cannot 
tell.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] When was that Sir.
   [$ (^Hudson.^) $] That very Night that the Gentleman that is      #
Dead, Mr. (^Mountford^) , was killed.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] You say, that my Lord (^Mohun^)    #
was present, when that Discourse of (^Hill^) 
was, about (^Mounford^) at the Tavern.
   [$ (^Hudson.^) $] Yes, but I cannot say my Lord took any notice   #
of it, for he made no Reply that I heard.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Have you done with this Witness.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Yes, my Lord,
   [$ (^Hudson.^) $] This is all that I know of the matter.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] My Lord (^Mohun^) , have you any     #
thing to say to this Witness.
   [$Lord (^Mohun.^) $] No my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Then our next Witnesses Name is    #
(^George Powell^) .  
[$Who was Sworn in like manner.$] 
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Mr. (^Powell^) , you have heard    #
the Questions that have been asked, Mr. 
(^Hudson^) , Pray will you make Answers to them; and give my Lords   #
an Account what you know 
of this matter.
<P 13>
   [$ (^Powell.^) $] May it please Your Lordships, about 5 or 6 days #
before Mr. (^Mountford^) was 
Wounded, I was in Company with Captain (^Hill^) , and he began Mrs.  #
(^Bracegirdles^) Health, I told him 
I would Pledge it. Says he, I am sure there is no Bar between me and #
Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) , but 
(^Mountford^) ; and I am Resolved to be Revenged on him, one way or  #
another. About 3 Days 
afterwards I was at Supper with my Lord (^Mohun^) and Captain        #
(^Hill^) , and another Gentleman, and 
the same Discourse arose again, and Captain (^Hill^) Whispered me in #
the Ear, says he, I am 
resolved to have the Blood of (^Mountford^) . I told him I did not   #
think it fit for him to speak so 
behind a Gentleman's back, and to me who was his Friend. I said I    #
would acquaint Mr. 
(^Mountford^) with what he said, and I did not doubt but he would    #
give him the satisfaction of a
Gentleman for any Injury he did him. I heard no further Discourse at #
that time, nor do I 
know more of that matter, till the Night that Mr. (^Mountford^) was  #
Wounded, when I saw him 
lying upon the Parlor Floor, and afterward saw him laid to Bed, and  #
sate up all Night with 
him, and about four a Clock in the Morning I asked Mr. (^Mountford^) #
how the thing 
happened. He told me Captain (^Hill^) killed him basely; I asked him #
if his Sword was drawn; 
Yes, says he, but it was after I had received my Wound, for whilst   #
my Lord (^Mohun^) talked to 
me (^Hill^) run me through.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] At that time, when those Words were       #
spoken at Supper, That he designed 
to be the Death of (^Mountford^) , was my Lord present?
   [$ (^Powell.^) $] Yes my Lord (^Mohun^) was present, but he was   #
Talking to Colonel (^Tredenham^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did my Lord (^Mohun^) say any thing to    #
what (^Hill^) said?
   [$ (^Powell.^) $] I did not hear him make any Answer to it at all.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Do you know any thing else in Relation to #
this Fact?
   [$ (^Powell.^) $] Nothing else but that Captain (^Hill^) did give #
a Letter to be delivered to Mrs.
(^Bracegirdle^) , but I know not whether it was delivered or not,    #
and he often told me he would Marry
her with all his Heart.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] You say you had that Discourse with       #
(^Mountford^) , when he lay a Dying.
   [$ (^Powell.^) $] It was about four a Clock, and he died about One.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Was there any thing said about my Lord    #
(^Mohun^) at that time?
   [$ (^Powell.^) $] Nothing but that my Lord (^Mohun^) was Talking  #
to him, whilst the other ran him 
through.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] If I understand you aright, you say      #
nothing against my Lord (^Mohun^) , but 
his being by one time at Supper when (^Hill^) said some Words about  #
(^Mountford^) ; and then the 
other thing you say is what (^Mountford^) told you after he was      #
Wounded. That my Lord was 
Talking to him, when (^Hill^) gave him the Wound.
   [$ (^Powell.^) $] Yes, My Lord, That is all that I heard.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Has your Lordship any thing to say to    #
this Witness?
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] No, My Lord.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] The next Witness that we shall desire to  #
call is Mrs. (^Knight^) . 

[$Who was SWORN.$]

   [$Mrs. (^Knight.^) $] I have nothing to say to my Lord            #
(^Mohun^) ; but what I have to say, is to 
Mr. (^Hill^) . About 4 days before Mr. (^Mountford^) was Killed, Mr. #
(^Hill^) came to me, and spoke 
to me about Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) : He told me he was satisfied she   #
hated him, I told him I did 
not believe she hated any body, or loved any Body: Yes, he said, she #
did love some body, 
but he had thought of a way to be even with that Body. Upon the      #
(^Wednesday^) Night before 
Mr. (^Mountford^) was killed, he came to me as I was coming out of   #
the Dressing Room; sayeth 
he, Mrs. (^Knight^) let me speak a Word with you, says he, you are   #
very great with Mrs. 
(^Bracegirdle^) , and I desire you to be so kind, as to speak to her #
for me, and I would beg of you if 
you would give me leave to give her this Letter from me: No, said I, #
Mr. (^Hill^) , I beg your 
Pardon; you say she hateth you, and if she hateth you, she will not  #
love any body that 
speaketh for you; and I am not fond of creating my self Enemies in   #
the House, knowing I have 
some already. What Enemies, saith Mr. (^Hill^) , (^Mountford^) do    #
you mean? And then repeating a 
great Oath, I shall find a way with him speedily.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] A way, with what?
   [$Mrs. (^Knight.^) $] A way with him speedily, (^Hill^) said it   #
of Mr. (^Mountford^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] What do you call this Witness for, Mr.   #
(^Attorny^) what use do you make of her
Evidence against my Lord (^Mohun^) ?
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, the use that we would make of    #
these Witnesses is to give an 
Account of the whole Fact from the Beginning to the End, (^Hills^)   #
Malice, and what was the 
Occasion of it, his Design in coming there that Night, and what he   #
did, and to leave it to 
your Lordships, to Judge what influence this will have, how far it   #
will affect my Lord (^Mohun^) . 
The next Witness is Mrs. (^Sandys^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] What is this Womans Name?
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Elizabeth Sandys^) .
<P 14>
[$She was SWORN.$]

   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Sandys^) , give my Lords an        #
Account, whether you were present with 
my Lord (^Mohun^) and Mr. (^Hill^) at the Tavern that day that Mr.   # 
(^Mountford^) was killed, and what 
passed there.
   [$ (^Sandys.^) $] I Dined with my Lord (^Mohun^) and Captain      #
(^Hill^) , at the (^Three Tuns^) in (^Shandois-street^) ,
and there arose a Discourse about Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) and           #
(^Hill^) , and my Lord (^Mohun^) asked me, 
if I thought (^Mountford^) had lay with her or no. I said I could    #
not tell; presently after says 
my Lord (^Mohun^) , it will cost (^Hill^) 50 Guineas this Design.    #
Saith Mr. (^Hill^) , if the Villain offers 
to resist I will Stab him; saith my Lord (^Mohun^) , I will stand by #
my Friend. When this was 
done, Mr. (^Hill^) desired Mr. (^Brough^) to borrow a Case of        #
Pistols of Captain (^Leister^) , and he 
said he would not borrow them himself, for he doubted, if he knew of #
the Design he would 
not lend them. When that was done, Captain (^Hill^) told me he had a #
Coach and Six Horses 
in (^Witch-Street^) , to seize Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) , and carry her  #
away into the Country; and my 
Lord (^Mohun^) said, he would stand by his Friend: And when my Lord  #
(^Mohun^) went away, 
(^Hill^) said to him; my Lord if you be not there by Six a Clock, I  #
am Ruined. Saith my 
Lord (^Mohun^) , upon my Word and Honour I will be at the Play House #
by Six.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] My Lord (^Mohun^) , have you any thing   #
to say to that Witness?
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] Yes, My Lord, I desire to have her asked,     #
whether she is a Maid or a 
Married Woman.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] You hear the Question, but I do not know #
what use my Lord will make 
of it.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] You can easily answer, whether you are    #
Married or Unmarried.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] That Question is very fair; are you a    #
Married Woman, or a single 
Woman?
   [$ (^Sandys.^) $] I am a single Woman, my Lord.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray Mrs. (^Sandys^) Repeat the Words     #
that my Lord (^Mohun^) said, when (^Hill^) 
said if the Villain resisted, he would Stab him.
   [$ (^Sandys.^) $] My Lord (^Mohun^) said nothing in the World,    #
but that he would stand by his 
Friend.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Have you any further Questions, (^Mr.    #
Attorny^) to ask this Witness?
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] I have nothing more to ask her my Lord.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] What say you my Lord (^Mohun^) ; would   #
you ask her any thing else?
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Then withdraw. 
[$Which she did.$]
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] The next Witness we call is (^Mr.         #
Rogers^) .    

[$Who was SWORN$]

   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] What is this Witnesses Name?
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] (^Rogers^) , my Lord.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] What is his Christian Name?
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] (^John.^) If your Lordships please to     #
remember, that the last Witness Mrs. 
(^Sandys^) said, That (^Mr. Hill^) desired my Lord (^Mohun^) , not   #
to fail of being at the Play-House by Six a 
Clock, and that he was undone if he did not come; and my Lord        #
promised upon his Word 
and Honour that he would come: Now we call this Witness to prove,    #
that they met at the
Play-House according to the Appointment on the 9th of (^December^) .
   [$ (^Rogers.^) $] My Lord, All that I know of this matter was,    #
That my Lord (^Mohun^) and Captain 
(^Hill^) were at the Play-House that Night, and that which made me   #
take particular Notice of 
their being then at the Play-House, tho' they had been frequently    #
there before together, was 
that Captain (^Hill^) had my Lord (^Mohun's^) Coat on, and my Lord   #
(^Mohun^) had Captain (^Hill's^)
Coat on.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did you observe any thing else, when they #
were at the Play-House?
   [$ (^Rogers.^) $] Nothing but only some Words that passed between #
Captain (^Hill^) and my Lord 
(^Mohun^) , when I went to ask them for the overplus of the mony for #
coming in, because they 
came out of the Pit upon the Stage; he said he would not give it me, #
but if I brought any of 
our Masters, he would slit their Noses or something to that Effect.
   [$ (^Mr, Att. Gen.^) $] Speak that over again.
   [$ (^Rogers.^) $] I asked them for mony, that they ought to pay   #
more than the rest that were in the
Pit, because they came upon the Stage, and they would not give it    #
me, but he said if I 
brought any of our Masters, he would Slit their Noses, or cut their  #
Faces, or to that 
Effect.
<P 15>
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] My Lord, will your Lordship ask him  #
any Questions?
   [$Lord (^Mohun.^) $] No my Lord.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Call another Witness then.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] My Lords, with your Lordships      #
Favour, the next Witness that we 
shall call, is the Coach-Man, (^William Dixon^) .
[$Who was Sworn.$]
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Mr. (^Dixon^) , do you remember    #
the Day when Mr. (^Mountford^) was killed?
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] Yes Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Pray acquaint my Lords, what       #
Persons you carryed in your Coach that 
Day, whether you carryed my Lord (^Mohun^) and Mr. (^Hill^) , and to #
what place, and where you 
waited for them.
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] If it please your Lordships, Captain (^Hill^)    #
and my Lord (^Mohun^) came in a Hackney
Coach to my Gate, where I live, and I was just a going to set my     #
Coaches into the Street
for Hyre: They Bargained with me for six Horses, and I was to have   #
thirty Shillings to set
them down at (^Totteridge^) on this side (^Barnet^) . I asked them   #
whether they would have me bring
all the six Horses with the Coach, No they said, a pair would serve  #
to the 
Play-House, and the other four should stand at the Pounds end. So I  #
went accordingly 
to the place appointed, over against the (^Horshooe-Tavern^) in      #
(^Drury-Lane^) , and a 
Foot-Man came, and Mr. (^Hill^) and he bid me drive down lower. So I #
drove to my 
Lord of (^Clares^) Door, or thereabouts; and there was some          #
Souldiers that would have had me 
go in, and Smoak and Drink with them: I told them, I did never       #
Smoak, and I did 
not care for Drinking any thing at that time. With that, my Lord     #
(^Mohun^) and Mr. (^Hill^) 
came into the Coach, and as they bid me, I carryed them into         #
(^Norfolk Street^) , below 
the Watch-House that stood there; they bid me turn about, and stand  #
there; and then 
they went for a little time to the (^White-Horse Tavern^) , so I did #
turn about, and staid as they 
bid me, and they tarryed a pretty while before they came again, and  #
then they bid me drive 
back to the place from whence I came, so I Drove into                #
(^Drury-Lane^) , and they bid me stop next to 
my Lord (^Craven's^) House, this was about Ten a Clock, and it being #
so late, I went Home, and 
sent a Postillion down, to take care of the Coach, so that what      #
passed afterwards, I cannot tell.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] What Day or Night, was all this you  #
speak of?
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] Truly my Lord, I cannot tell what Day it was, it #
was in (^December^) , as I take it, the 
(^9th.^) and it was (^Friday^) I believe, I do not know justly.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Did you hear of the Death of Mr.     #
(^Mountford^) ?
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] Yes, I did.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Was it the same Day that you heard   #
Mr. (^Mountford^) was killed.
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] No, I did not hear it till the next Morning.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] You say, you went with my Lord     #
(^Mohun^) and Mr. (^Hill^) into (^Norfolk Street^) ,
and there you stayed for them, whilst they went elsewhere.
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] Yes, I did so.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Do you know to what Houses they    #
went?
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] They went to the (^White-Horse Tavern^) , to the #
hithermost House on this side the (^Strand^) ,
and they went below to a Door on this side of a House that is not    #
finished yet.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Did you hear them use any          #
Expressions there.
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] I heard (^Hill^) say to my Lord (^Mohun^) , I    #
think there is a Man and a Maid talking, it was
at the Corner House; saith (^Hill^) , we are Betrayed, Damme saith   #
he, my Lord, let us go 
and Thresh him.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] What did they do then?
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] I did see them do nothing.
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Whither did you carry them from    #
thence?
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] To the place from whence they came, in (^Drury   #
Lane^) .
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Will your Lordship say any thing to  #
this man?
   [$Lord (^Mohun.^) $] I desire he may be asked, whether he had     #
not Orders to go out of Town with 
us, as soon as Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) was put into the Coach.
   [$ (^Dixon.^) $] If it please you Sir, I had Order thus, that     #
when we were to go out of Town, I
must Drive down into the (^Strand^) , and then round about any way   #
that was readiest and clearest to
get to the Pound, that Order I had, and no other Order I had.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Who is your next Witness?
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] My Lords, the next Witness we      #
shall call, will give you an Account 
what was done in (^Drury Lane^) , upon their endeavouring to carry   #
her away, and for that we have 
here Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) her self.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] What is this Gentlewomans Name?
   [$Mr. (^Attorney General.^) $] Mrs. (^Ann Bracegirdle^) .
[$ (^Then she was Sworn.^) $] 
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) , Pray give my Lords #
an Account of the whole of your
Knowledge of the Attempt that was made upon you in (^Drury-Lane^) ,  #
and what followed upon it.
<P 16>   
   [$Mrs. (^Bracegirdle.^) $] My Lord, I was in (^Prince's-Street^)  #
at Supper at Mr. (^Page's^) , and at ten a 
Clock at Night, (^Mr. Page^) went Home with me; and coming down      #
(^Drury Lane^) , there stood a 
Coach by my Lord (^Craven's^) Door, and the Boot of the Coach was    #
down, and a great many 
men stood by it; and just as I came to the Place where the Coach     #
stood, two Soldiers came 
and pulled me from (^Mr. Page^) , and four or five more came up to   #
them, and they knocked my 
Mother down almost, for my Mother and my Brother were with me. My    #
Mother recovered, 
and came and hung about my Neck, so that they could not get me into  #
the Coach, and (^Mr. Page^) 
went to call Company to rescue me. Then (^Mr. Hill^) came with his   #
Sword drawn, and struck at 
(^Mr. Page^) and my Mother; and when they could not get me into the  #
Coach, because Company 
came in, he said he would see me Home, and he led me by one Hand,    #
and my Mother by the 
other. And when we came Home, he pulled (^Mr. Page^) by the Sleeve,  #
and said, Sir, I would 
speak with you.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Pray (^Mrs. Bracegirdle^) , did you see   #
any Body in the Coach when they pulled 
you to it?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] Yes, my Lord (^Mohun^) was in the     #
Coach; when they pulled me to the 
Coach, I saw my Lord (^Mohun^) in the Coach. And when we came Home,  #
(^Hill^) pulled (^Mr. Page^) 
by the Sleeve, and said he would speak with him. As they led me      #
along (^Drury Lane^) , my Lord 
(^Mohun^) came out of the Coach, and followed us, and all the        #
Soldiers followed them, but they 
were dismissed, and, as I said, when we came to our Lodging, then    #
(^Hill^) pulled (^Mr. Page^) by the 
Sleeve, and said, he would speak with him. Saith (^Mr. Page^) ,      #
(^Mr. Hill^) , another time will do, 
to Morrow will serve; with that, when I was within Doors,            #
(^Mr. Page^) was pulled into the 
House, and (^Mr. Hill^) walked up and down in the Street with his    #
Sword drawn. He had his 
Sword drawn when he came along with me.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did you observe him to say any thing      #
whilst he was with you?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] As I was going down the Hill, he      #
said, as he led me, he would be 
revenged.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] Did he name of whom he would be revenged?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] He did not name of whom then, but     #
when I was in the House, several
Persons went to the Door, and afterwards (^Mrs. Brown^) went to the  #
Door, and spoke to them, and 
asked them what they staid and walked there for; at last, they said, #
they staid to be 
revenged of (^Mr. Mountford^) , and then (^Mrs. Brown^) came in to   #
me, and told me of it.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Who said that?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] Mr. (^Hill^) .
   [$ (^Mr. Att. General.^) $] Were my Lord (^Mohun^) and            #
(^Mr. Hill^) both together when that was said, that 
they staid to be revenged of (^Mr. Mountford^) ?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] Yes they were. And when               #
(^Mrs. Brown^) came in and told me, I sent my
Brother and the Maid, and all the People we could, out of the House  #
to (^Mrs. Mountford^) , to desire 
her to send, if she knew where her Husband was, to tell him of it,   #
and she did. And when 
they came in a Doors again, I went to the Door, and the Doors were   #
shut, and I listened to 
hear if they were there still, and my Lord (^Mohun^) and             #
(^Mr. Hill^) were walking up and down the 
Street; and by and by, the Watch came up to them, and when the       #
Watch came, they said, 
Gentlemen, Why do you walk with your Swords drawn? Says my Lord      #
(^Mohun^) , I am a Peer 
of (^England^) , touch me if you dare.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Repeat that again, for I could not   #
well hear you: Do you speak of what 
you heard from (^Mrs. Brown^) , or what you observed your self?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] My Lord, I was within Doors, but I    #
was listening at the Door, and heard 
this my self; they came up to them, and said, Gentlemen, Why do you  #
walk with your Swords 
drawn?
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] Who asked that Question?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] The Watch; and, says my Lord          #
(^Mohun^) , I am a Peer of (^England^) , touch 
me if you dare. Then the Watch left them, and they went away, and a  #
little after, there was 
a Cry of Murder, and that is all that I know, my Lord.
   [$ (^Lord Mohun.^) $] My Lord, I desire this Witness may be       #
asked, how long after this Passage 
that she speaketh of, was it that she heard Murder cryed in the      #
Street.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] You hear the Question,               #
(^Mrs. Bracegirdle^) , What say you to it?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] My Lord, I believe it was about a     #
quarter of an Hour after, to the best of
my Memory.
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] What do you mean, a quarter of an    #
Hour after the Watch asked the 
Question?
   [$ (^Mrs. Bracegirdle.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
[$ (^Then the Earl of^) Mulgrave (^stood up^) .$]
   [$ (^Lord High Steward.^) $] My Lord (^Mulgrave^) .
   [$ (^E. of Mulgrave.^) $] My Lord, I desire to ask this Witness a #
question. If I heard her aright, I think 
she said, they threaten'd to be Revenged of Mr. (^Mountford^) , I    #
desire to know of her, whether my 
Lord (^Mohun^) did threaten him.
<P 17>
   [$Mrs. (^Bracegirdle.^) $] I do not know indeed; but when Mrs.    #
(^Browne^) asked them what they 
staid there for? They said to be Revenged of Mr. (^Mountford^) . I   #
did not hear them my 
self, but Mrs. (^Browne^) came in and told me so.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) , I think, if I did   #
not mistake, you said, when the Watch 
came up, they asked them, why their Swords were drawn?
   [$Mrs. (^Bracegirdle.^) $] Yes, and my Lord (^Mohun^) made        #
answer, he was a Peer of (^England^) ,
and bid them touch him if they durst, and they went away.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, the next Witness that we call,    #
shall be Mr. (^Gawen Page^) , at 
whose House Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) Supped that Night.

[$ (^ (He was Sworn.^) $]

   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Mr. (^Page^) , I suppose you remember the  #
Night, when Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) 
Supped at your House.
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] I pray give an account of your whole       #
Knowledge about this Matter, 
What happen'd that Night.
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] About Ten a Clock at Night, on (^Friday^) the  #
Ninth of (^December^) last, going 
down (^Drury-Lane^) with Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) , whom I Led just      #
against my Lord (^Craven's^) House. 
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Pray Sir, speak out, and tell us what    #
time it was.
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] About Ten a Clock at Night, on (^Friday^) the  #
Ninth of (^December^) last, going 
down (^Drury-Lane^) , and leading Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) , right       #
against my Lord (^Craven's^) Door, stood 
a Coach, where two Soldiers pressed in between me and Mrs.           #
(^Bracegirdle^) , and parted us: 
I asked what that was for? But they took hold of Mrs.                #
(^Bracegirdle^) , and immediately they 
would have forced her into the Coach; Capt. (^Hill^) , whom I saw    #
there with his Sword 
drawn, made several Blows at me.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Who would have forced her into the Coach?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] The Soldiers would.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray go on Sir, what follow'd after that?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] I say, Capt. (^Hill^) made several Blows at    #
me, and Cry'd you Villain, Stand. 
I received several of them upon my Cane, but there was none that     #
hurt me; then I got 
Help, and they were prevented of carrying Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) away. #
My Lord (^Mohun^) 
was in the Coach; I saw him in the Coach.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you see any Arms in the Coach?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] I saw no Arms, but I saw a Bundle in the       #
Coach, tho I could not tell 
what it was; and there was one in the Coach, that I saw was my Lord  #
(^Mohun^) . So when 
we had got Help, we went down the Lane to Convey her home, and Capt. #
(^Hill^) was 
with us, and my Lord (^Mohun^) followed at a distance. Capt.         #
(^Hill^) said to the Soldiers, 
(^Be gone, I have nothing more to do with you now^) . When we came   #
to the House and Mrs. 
(^Bracegirdle^) was entring in, Captain (^Hill^) pull'd me by the    #
Sleeve, and said he would speak
with me. Said I, to Night is not a fit time, to Morrow is better,    #
therefore pray stay 
till to Morrow Morning. But said he, (^God Damme, you will not go    #
Home to Night^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] You speak so low, that I cannot tell     #
what you say; I did not hear 
that last that you said.
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] My Lord, I say, when Captain Hill pull'd me by #
the Sleeve, and said he 
would speak with me, I told him, that Night was not a fit time, to   #
Morrow would do 
better: Well, saith he, (^To Morrow then; but, God Damn me, you will #
not go out to Night^) 
I went in a Doors, and there my Lord (^Mohun^) and he staid for an   #
Hour and a half, as I 
was told; I saw them not my self: But Mrs. (^Browne^) came in and    #
said, that they said, 
they waited to be Revenged.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Whom did they mean, your self that they    #
would be Revenged of?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] Mrs. (^Browne^) said, they waited for          #
Mr. (^Mountford^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you continue in that House till after  #
the Murder was committed?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] Yes Sir, I did.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] How long after you came into the House   #
was the Fact done?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] About an Hour and an half.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Did you your self hear or observe any    #
thing to be said or done, from 
the time you came into the House, to the time the Fact was committed?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] No, my Lord, I was in the Back Room of the     #
House,
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray, Mr. (^Page^) , did you see Mr.       #
(^Mountford^) after he was Wounded?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] Yes, I did.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Then give my Lords an account what passed  #
at that Visit.
<P 18>
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] Upon the outcry of Murder, I came out into the #
Street, where I found 
my Lord (^Mohun^) just Surrendring himself to the Constable; and     #
immediately I went 
to Mr. (^Mountford's^) House, and I found him lying all along in his #
Blood upon the Floor; 
he seeing me, desired me to lift him up, which I did, and thinking   #
he had been Dying, I 
asked him whether he knew me. He said Yes. Said I to him, Had you    #
time to draw your 
Sword in your Defence? He said, (^He was barbarously run Through     #
before he could Draw 
it^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Is this all you have to say, Sir?
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] Yes.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Will your Lordship ask this Witness any  #
Questions?
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] My Lord, I desire he may be asked whether my  #
Sword was Drawn when 
I Surrendred my self to the Constable.
   [$Mr. (^Page.^) $] No my Lord, your Sword was in the Scabbard     #
when you Surrendred your
self, but I cannot say that your Sword was Drawn before, or not.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] The next Witness that we desire to call,   #
is Mrs. (^Page^) .

[$ (^ (She was Sworn.^) $]

   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] What is the Name of this Witness?
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Mary Page^) . Pray Mrs. (^Page^) ,  #
do you remember the Night when 
Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) Supped at your House, and Mr. (^Mountford^) was #
Killed? Acquaint my 
Lords with all you did observe that Night.
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) Supped at my Lodging,    #
and my Husband went home with 
her, and staying something longer than ordinary, I sent my Servant   #
to know what was 
the reason of it: He brought me word back, that my Husband had like  #
to have been 
Murdered, and Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) carried away. With that I went    #
down my self towards 
Mrs. (^Bracegirdle's^) Lodgings, and there I found my Lord (^Mohun^) #
and Mr. (^Hill^) walking, 
Mr. (^Hill^) with his Sword Drawn before Mrs. (^Bracegirdle's^)      #
Door; my Lord (^Mohun's^) not. 
So I went in, into the House; and after I had staid a while there,   #
Mrs. (^Browne^) came out 
to them, and asked them why they Staid there? They made answer, they #
staid for Mr. 
(^Mountford^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Who made that Answer?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] Mr. (^Hill^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Who was with Mr. (^Hill^) at that time?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] My Lord (^Mohun^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was there any body besides those two, that #
you observed?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] No, there was no body else that I saw.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were their Swords Drawn?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] Mr. (^Hill's^) then was, my Lord (^Mohun's^)  #
at that present was not: But Mrs.
(^Bracegirdle^) hearing that they waited for Mr. (^Mountford^) ,     #
desired me to go over to Mrs. 
(^Mountford's^) House, and speak to her to send to her Husband, and  #
desire him to keep 
where he was, or come home with a good Guard, whilst I was telling   #
Mrs. (^Mountford^) 
what I was desired to tell her -- But I should have told your        #
Lordships, that when 
I came out to go to Mrs. (^Mountford^) , my Lord (^Mohun^) had then  #
his Sword Drawn.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were they there when you went out of Mrs.  #
(^Bracegirdle's^)
Lodgings?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] Yes, they were.
   [$ (^Mr. Att. Gen.^) $] And are you sure, that at that time when  #
you went out of Mrs. 
(^Bracegirdle's^) House, my Lord (^Mohun^) had his Sword Drawn?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] I am sure of it, that when I went out, my     #
Lord (^Mohun^) had then his Sword 
Drawn; that was the Second time.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Out of whose House was that you went?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] Out of Mrs. (^Bracegirdle's^) Lodgings.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Where were they when you saw his Sword   #
Drawn?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] They were walking before Mrs.                 #
(^Bracegirdle's^) Door, from one end of the 
Street [^SOURCE TEXT: Srreet^] to the other.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What Street is that?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] Howard-Street.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray describe to my Lords that Street.
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] They that stand in that Street, can see who   #
goeth down to Mr. (^Mountford's^)
House, and who goeth up (^Surry-Street^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Well now go on.
<P 19>
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] Whilst I was desiring Mrs. (^Mountford^) to   #
send away to her Husband, I heard
Murder cry'd out; immediately I open'd Mr. (^Mountford's^) Door, and #
he came in, and 
fell with his Arms round about my Neck to support himself, I         #
suppose, and he said, 
(^Hill^) had Murder'd him. I helped him as far as the Parlor Door,   #
and there down he 
fell. I went up the Street and called out (^Murder^) , and my Lord   #
(^Mohun^) came to me,
and bid me take notice, he had no hand in the Murder, for his Sword  #
was not Drawn. 
I told him, I could not tell that, for to my knowledge he had been   #
in Mr. (^Hill's^)
Company with his naked Sword just before.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Call Mrs. (^Browne^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] You have nothing so say to that Witness  #
my Lord, have you?
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Is this all you have to say, Mrs. (^Page^) ?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] After this, my Lord (^Mohun^) resign'd        #
himself up to the Constable, the 
Constable standing by me, I bid him Secure my Lord (^Mohun^) , which #
he did.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] My Lord, I desire to ask this Witness,        #
whether I Surrendred my self, or 
made Opposition, or offered to run away?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] No my Lord, the Constable laid hold on you.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] What Answer do you make to my Lord's     #
Question?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] I say, my Lord, the Constable laid hold upon  #
my Lord (^Mohun^) .
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire to ask her, whether I did not        #
Surrender my self?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] Not till I had desired the Constable to       #
Secure your Lordship.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] Did I make any Opposition, or offer to run    #
away?
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] No, for the Constable presently took hold of  #
your Lordship.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire she may be asked whether (^Hill^)    #
Run away.
   [$Mrs. (^Page.^) $] That I know not; I suppose he was gone away   #
out of the Street before 
I came forth.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Swear Mrs. (^Browne^) . [$Which was done.$]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Browne^) , you are upon your Oath,  #
pray declare to my Lords 
what you know happen'd upon that Night that Mr. (^Mountford^) was    #
Killed.
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] If it please your Lordships, when Mrs.      #
(^Bracegirdle^) came Home, I found 
her Crying? I asked her what was the matter? She said, my Lord       #
(^Mohun^) , and Mr. 
(^Hill^) , had run her into a Coach, with six or seven Soldiers, and #
lifted her into the 
Coach, and she said they were at the Door. Upon which, I went to the #
Door, and 
saw my Lord (^Mohun^) and Mr. (^Hill^) walking along. Said I, are    #
you the Gentlemen 
that have used Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) in this manner? My Lord          #
(^Mohun^) answered, Madam,
said he, (^I Protected her; if it had not been for me, the Rabble    #
would have torn her a 
pieces; for if we had had a mind to carry her away, we had six or    #
seven Pistols Charged 
in the Coach, and could easily have suppressed the Tumult^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] I do not hear what this Witness saith,   #
she speaketh so low.
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] My Lord (^Mohun^) said, they had Six or     #
Seven Pistols in the Coach, and 
could easily have suppressed the Rabble, if they would have carried  #
her away; but 
he had no Design upon her for his own part, but only to serve his    #
Friend; and that 
Mr. (^Hill's^) design was to take her out of Town, and keep her a    #
Week, and see if he 
could perswade her to Marry him; and saith Mr. (^Hill^) , (^I shall  #
light on this^) Mountford. 
Why, said I to him, What hurt hath Mr. (^Mountford^) done you? Saith #
he, (^I have been 
Abused, and I will be Revenged^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] That was (^Hill^) that said so.
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] Yes. So I went and told Mrs. (^Mountford^)  #
of it.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray acquaint my Lords what my Lord        #
(^Mohun^) said to you about 
this Matter.
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] My Lord (^Mohun^) said, he protected her,   #
for if it had not been for 
him, the (^Mob^) had torn her in pieces; but if they had had a mind  #
to carry her off, 
they could easily have suppressed the (^Mob^) , for they had six or  #
seven Pistols in the 
Coach: But saith my Lord, (^I had no design upon her my self, but    #
only to serve my 
Friend^) . So saith Mr. (^Hill^) , (^I shall light upon this         #
Mountford^) . Why, said I, what hurt 
hath Mr. (^Mountford^) done you? Saith he, (^I have been Abused, and #
I will have my Revenge^) . 
So I went and told Mrs. (^Mountford^) of it. About half an Hour      #
after, or more, (^Mr.
Mountford^) came down, and when he came down, I saw him a little     #
before he came 
to them, and went to him, and would fain have spoke to him, but he   #
would not 
stay to let me speak what I had to say to him, but going on,         #
presently he met my 
Lord (^Mohun^) . Saith he, (^Your Humble Servant, my Lord^) . Saith  #
my Lord again, (^Your Servant^) 
Mr. Mountford. Saith my Lord, (^I have a great Respect for you^) ,   #
Mr. Mountford, (^and would
have no Difference between us; but there is a thing fallen out       #
between Mr.^) Hill (^and Mrs.^)  
<P 20>
Bracegirdle. Saith Mr. (^Mountford^) , (^My Lord, has my Wife        #
disobliged your Lordship? if she has, 
she shall ask your Pardon; but as for^) Mrs. Bracegirdle, (^she is   #
no concern of mine; and I hope your 
Lordship will not vindicate such an ill Man as^) Mr. Hill (^in such  #
a matter as this. Upon that I 
heard^) Mr. Hill (^bid^) Mr. Mountford (^draw^) , Mr. Mountford      #
(^said, that I will; and drew his 
Sword; but whether he received his Wound before he drew his Sword,   #
or after, I cannot tell^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Speak that last again.
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] Mr. (^Mountford^) and my Lord met; saith    #
Mr. (^Mountford^) , your Servant, my 
Lord; saith my Lord, Your Servant, Mr. (^Mountford^) , I have a      #
great respect for you, 
and would have no difference be between us; but here has been a      #
thing fallen out 
between Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) and Mr. (^Hill^) ; saith Mr.            #
(^Mountford^) presently again, Has my 
Wife disobliged your Lordship? If she has, she shall ask your        #
Pardon. But Mrs. 
(^Bracegirdle^) is no concern of mine: I know nothing of this        #
matter, I come here by accident.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Who said they came there by accident?
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] Mr. (^Mountford^) said, I know nothing of   #
this matter, I come here by 
accident. But, I hope, your Lordship will not vindicate (^Hill^) in  #
such Actions as 
these are: Upon that, I heard Mr. (^Hill^) bid Mr. (^Mountford^)     #
draw, Mr. (^Mountford^) said 
he would, and drew his Sword; but whether he receiv'd his Wound      #
before or after, I
cannot tell; it was in the Night.
[$Then the Lord (^Godolphin^) stood up.$]
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] My Lord (^Godolphin^) .
   [$ (^L. Godolphin.^) $] My Lord (^Steward^) , I desire this       #
Witness may be asked, whether my 
Lord (^Mohun's^) Sword was drawn when he talked with (^Mountford^) , #
because the Council 
opened it before, that the Watch came to them, and saw them with     #
their Swords drawn 
when they were walking in the Street.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Mrs. you heard my Lord's Question: Was   #
my Lord (^Mohun's^) Sword 
drawn whilst he talked with (^Mountford^) , or no?
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] I do not remember I did see my Lord         #
(^Mohun's^) Sword drawn.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were they near together?
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] They were near together.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire she may be asked whether I went up   #
the Street to meet Mr. 
(^Mountford^) , or he came down to me?
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] You heard the Question, Mistress, what   #
say you?
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] Mr. (^Mountford^) came down to him.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire she may be asked whether she did not #
go to hinder Mr. (^Mountford^) 
from coming that way?
   [$Mrs. (^Brown^) $] Yes, I did go to speak to him, but he did not #
hear me speak, or did not 
hearken to me; I took him by the Hand, and told him I would speak    #
with him, but 
he did not hear me, but went on.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] You did not tell him upon what account you #
would have spoke with 
him?
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] No, I had not time.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire she may be asked, whether Mr.        #
(^Mountford's^) Sword was within his 
Arm, or by his Side.
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] I believe it was by his Side.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire she may be asked one Question more,  #
whether he could not have 
went home, without coming to Mr. (^Hill^) and me?
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] He did come out of his way, his way was not #
by my House; he did 
come down the Street towards them.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire your Lordships to take notice, that  #
he came out of his way to me. 
I desire to aske her: Did he come as if he was going to his own      #
House or yours?
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] As if he was coming to mine.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire to ask her, whether I had any hand   #
in killing Mr. (^Mountford^) , or 
went to hold him, or meddled with him?
   [$Mrs. (^Browne.^) $] Not that I did see.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Have you any more to say to this Witness?
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Nor your Lordship?
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Then the next Witness we desire to call,   #
is, (^Richard Row^) .
[$ (^ (Who was Sworn.^) $]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] (^Richard Row^) , where do you live?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] In (^Surry-street^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Where doth he Live saith he?
<P 21>
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] In (^Surry-street^) , my Lord. Pray how    #
near is that to the Place where 
Mr. (^Mountford^) was Killed?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] About ten or twelve Pole.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you observe my Lord (^Mohun^) and Mr.  #
(^Hill^) that Night, and where 
were they?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] All that I can say to the matter in that Case is,  #
I was in my own House about 
a quarter after Ten a Clock, and I heard a noise in the Street, and  #
I went out, and 
saw two Gentlemen and two Lads about the middle of the Channel; one  #
of the Lads 
had one of the Gentlemen by the Arm, just by the Channel, and said,  #
(^Pray my Lord, Good 
my Lord, don't do it, alter your Resolution^) . There was an Answer  #
made, that they would 
be Revenged that Night, or to Morrow.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Do you know who the Boy was that used that #
Expression?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] No, my Lord, it was very Dark.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Do you not know neither who returned the   #
Answer?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] No indeed.
   [$M. (^Att. Gen.^) $] But you are sure you heard those words pass?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] Yes indeed, and I went to the Door afterwards,     #
whilst they went to the 
upper end of the Street and returned again; and I saw Captain        #
(^Hill's^) Boy following him. 
My Lord, I knew Capt. (^Hill^) , tho he was not in the Cloaths he    #
formerly used to come 
to my House in, and the Boy I knew to be his Boy.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were those Persons together that you heard #
speaking so?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] Yes, all four together, in a Confusion they seemed #
to be, for they were 
Pushing to and agen, and the Boy had hold of one of the Gentlemen's  #
Arms when he bid 
him alter his Resolution.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Repeat those Words again that you heard    #
him say.
   [$ (^Row.^) $] (^Pray my Lord, good my Lord, do not do it, alter  #
your Resolution.^) 
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Has your Lordship any thing to ask this  #
Witness?
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^Row.^) $] I spoke of this same afterwards, and so they have  #
brought me here to give 
Evidence: That is all that I can say. I cannot Swear to my Lord      #
(^Mohun^) , that he was 
one, I do not know that ever I saw him to my knowledge in my Life.
   [$ (^E. of Mulgrave.^) $] My Lord Steward, I desire he may be     #
asked, whether he knoweth 
who that Boy was that made that Answer.
   [$ (^Row.^) $] There was no answer made by any Boy, but begging   #
and praying, (^That my 
Lord would not do it^) .
   [$E. of (^Mulgrave.^) $] Do you know who that Boy was?
   [$ (^Row.^) $] No, I do not know what Boy it was. But when I      #
heard Mr. (^Mountford^) was 
Killed, and my Lord (^Mohun^) was concerned, I told what I had       #
heard and seen, and so 
they bring me here to Evidence it. That is all I can say to the      #
matter.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lord, we desire next to call some of    #
the Watch, and shall begin 
with (^Merry^) .   
[$ (^ (Who was Sworn.^) $]
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] What is his Name?
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] (^William Merry^) . Mr. (^Merry^) , I      #
think you are Beadle of the Parish.
   [$ (^Merry.^) $] Yes, I am.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray acquaint my Lords what you observed   #
that Night Mr. (^Mountford^) 
was Killed, when you saw my Lord (^Mohun^) and Mr. (^Hill^) , the    #
first time and the second 
time, when my Lord (^Mohun^) was Taken.
   [$ (^Merry.^) $] When I first came down the Street, walking the   #
Rounds between Eleven and 
Twelve a Clock, as I turned at the Corner out of (^Surry-street^)    #
into (^Howard-street^) , I saw my 
Lord (^Mohun^) and Capt. (^Hill^) Walking, that is, upon the Paved   #
Stones; my Lord was 
walking towards me, and I asked, Who comes there? Saith my Lord, a   #
Friend. Said 
I, What is the meaning of your Swords being Drawn? Return your       #
Swords, and 
stand off. With that, he returned his Sword immediately. Saith he,   #
(^I am a Peer of the 
Land; here, will you have my Sword^) ? and he profered me his Sword; #
but the 
Constable was not there then, and I did not take his Sword; but,     #
said I, God Bless your 
Honor my Lord, I know not what you are, but I hope you are doing no  #
harm; No, 
saith he. With that, the Constable came immediately, and he profered #
the same to 
him; there were two Candles in some Maids, or Womans hands at a Door #
hard by, and 
I went to ask them if they knew the meaning of it; and there being a #
Neighbours Man 
leaning with a Bottle and a Glass against the Wall, whom I knew. I   #
think they told 
me one of them had a Sweet-heart there; and my Lord said, he was     #
drinking a Lady's 
Health, and as soon as his Bottle was out, he would be gone. That is #
all I heard of the 
matter.
<P 22>
   [$M. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was Mr. (^Hill^) there?
   [$ (^Merry.^) $] Yes, he was.
   [$M. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was his Sword Drawn?
   [$ (^Merry.^) $] Yes, his Sword was drawn, and I asked what made  #
that Gentleman with 
his Sword Drawn? and my Lord (^Mohun^) said, he had lost his         #
Scabbard; but seeing this 
Neighbour's Man stand there, I went to the House.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were both their Swords drawn at first?
   [$ (^Merry^) $] Both their Swords were Drawn when I came first    #
into the Street; but my 
Lord put up his Sword, and the other continued Drawn, by reason as   #
they said, he 
had lost his Scabbard. And so seeing, as I said, my Neighbour's Man  #
standing there, 
we went to that House to enquire if they knew what their Business    #
was; we were not 
got into the House, I am sure not a Stone's cast within the House,   #
but Murder was
cry'd out, and we came back again, and my Master being nimbler of    #
Foot than I, 
because he was a younger Man, came first into the Place, and Seized  #
My Lord before 
I came; how the Seizing was I do not know.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Our next Witness is (^Thomas Fennell^) .

[$ (^Who was Sworn.^) $]

   [$M. (^Att. Gen.^) $] (^Fennel^) , you was one of the Watch that  #
night when Mr. (^Mountford^) was 
Killed.
   [$ (^Fennel.^) $] Yes, Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Give my Lords an account what you observed #
that Night, in relation 
to my Lord (^Mohun^) and Mr. (^Hill^) .
   [$ (^Fennel.^) $] The Constable and his Watch going the Rounds,   #
divided themselves into 
two parts; I went down (^Surry-Street^) with one Party; the          #
Constable he went down 
(^Strand-Lane^) with the other Party. We were four or five that came #
down (^Surry-Street^) , and 
when we came down, my Lord (^Mohun^) and Capt. (^Hill's^) Swords     #
were both Drawn; 
my Lord (^Mohun^) put up his Sword just as we came down.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Speak out Man, that my Lords may all     #
hear you.
   [$ (^Fennel.^) $] I say, the Constable and his Party went down    #
(^Strand-Lane^) , and another 
Party down (^Surry-street^) , four or five of us, and my Lord        #
(^Mohun^) and Capt. (^Hill^) had both 
their Swords Drawn: When we came down, my Lord put up his Sword just #
as we 
came down, but the Constable not being come, I went and called him.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] You say both their Swords were Drawn when  #
you came down.
   [$ (^Fennel.^) $] Yes, but my Lord put up his Sword just as we    #
came down.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What time of Night was that?
   [$ (^Fennel.^) $] It was between Eleven and Twelve.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] How long before the Murder was committed?
   [$ (^Fennel.^) $] A quarter of an Hour.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Do you not say, they put up their Swords #
as soon as you came 
down?
   [$ (^Fennel.^) $] My Lord (^Mohun^) put up his Sword, but         #
(^Hill^) said he had never a Scabbard.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you ask them why they had their Swords #
drawn at that time of 
Night?
   [$ (^Fennel.^) $] No, I went to call the Constable.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Have you any more to ask of this Witness?
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] I have not my Lord.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Nor you my Lord?
   [$L. (^Mohun.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$L. (^H. Steward.^) $] Pray go on then; whom do you produce next?
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Our next Witness is (^James Bassit^) 
[$ (^Who was Sworn.^) $]

   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Were you one of the Watch that Night Mr.   #
(^Mountford^) was Killed?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you see my Lord (^Mohun^) and Capt.    #
(^Hill^) that Night?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] Yes.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Acquaint my Lords where it was, and in     #
what manner you found 
them.
   [$ (^Bassit^) $] In (^Howard-street^) ; I came along with the     #
Constable, and I walked before 
them that went down (^Surry-Street^) with my Lanthorn, and there was # 
my Lord 
(^Mohun^) with his Sword Drawn, and Capt (^Hill^) with his the like: #
We asked them, what 
<P 23>
they did there? They said they were drinking of a Bottle of Wine:    #
(^Hill^) said to me,
you may knock me down if you please: Nay, said I, we never use to    #
knock any 
Gentlemen down, unless there be occasion; and then we went into      #
(^Norfolk-street^) to the 
Tavern to examine what they were, and what they were doing; and in   #
the mean time 
the Murder was done.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Did you not ask them why their Swords were #
drawn?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] Yes, I did.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What did they say?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] (^Hill^) made answer that he had lost his       #
Scabbard.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What said my Lord (^Mohun^) ?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] My Lord (^Mohun^) had put up his Sword by that  #
time we came up to him: That 
is all I can say to it.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] If you have nothing more to ask him,     #
call another.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] My Lord, I desire he may be asked whether he  #
came with the Constable 
when I surrendred my self?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] Yes, and I took hold of your Sleeve, and you    #
shook and quak'd and trembled,
as if you would tear it to pieces.
   [$ (^L. Mohun.^) $] I desire he may be asked whether my Sword was #
in the Scabbard when I
surrendred my self.
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] Yes, it was, he surrendred it.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] That was after the Murder was done.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] With your Lordship's Favour, I desire he   #
may answer my Lord 
(^Mohun's^) first Question again, so as to be heard by your          #
Lordships; What was that you were 
saying when my Lord surrendred himself?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] I took him by the Arm when he surrendred        #
himself up.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] What then?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] Then he quaked, and I had him away to the       #
(^Round-House^) .
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Hear my Question, you say you took him   #
by the Sleeve, when he 
surrendred himself; what do you mean by that? is it that he had      #
surrendred himself 
before you laid hold on him, or afterwards?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] I took hold of his Arm, when he surrendred      #
himself.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] But was it before he surrendred himself  #
to the Constable?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] No, it was afterwards, my Lord; to have him away.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Then you did see him surrender himself   #
to the Constable?
   [$ (^Bassit.^) $] Yes, my Lord.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Then call Mr. (^Charles Knowles^) : [$But  #
he did not appear.$]
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Whom do you call next, Sir?
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] My Lords, we call'd Mr. (^Charles          #
Knowles^) ; but they say, he is not 
come, therefore with your Lordships favour, we will call Mrs.        #
(^Brewer^) .
[$ (^ (Who was sworn.^) $]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Mrs. (^Brewer^) , I think, you live at the #
next Door to Mrs. (^Bracegirdles's^) 
Lodging?
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] Yes, I do so.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Pray give my Lords an account what you saw #
and heard that Night 
Mr. (^Mountford^) was kill'd.
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] I was at Mrs. (^Bracegirdle's^) House, and  #
I went to the Door with them; 
and just as I went to the Door, my Lord (^Mohun^) came up to me; and #
just as he came to 
the Door, Mr. (^Mountford^) came down the Street, and my Lord went   #
to him, and 
imbraced him, and said, Mr. (^Mountford^) , Your humble Servant, I   #
am glad to see you; 
Who is this said Mr. (^Mountford^) , my Lord (^Mohun^) ? Yes said my #
Lord. What 
makes your Lordship here at this time a night, saith Mr.             #
(^Mountford^) ? Saith my Lord 
again, I suppose Mr. (^Mountford^) you was sent for; sent for, for   #
what saith he? You have 
heard of the business of Mrs. (^Bracegirdle^) , I suppose, saith my  #
Lord: No my Lord, saith 
he, I come by chance.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Who said that?
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] Mr. (^Mountford^) , Sir.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Well, go on and speak aloud.
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] My Lord, Mr. (^Mountford^) . -- [$And there #
she hesitated, and seemed 
to be in a Confusion.$]
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] She is not used to such publick            #
Examinations: If your Lordships will 
please to allow her to begin again, because she is in some           #
Confusion, she will be the 
better able to give you what account she can of this matter.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Let her recollect her self, and begin    #
again.
<P 24>
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] When Mr. (^Mountford^) came down the        #
Street, I stood at the Door, and 
my Lord (^Mohun^) was come to the Door, and my Lord (^Mohun^) went   #
to him and said, 
Mr. (^Mountford^) , (^your Humble Servant, I am glad to see you^) ,  #
and Embraced him. Saith Mr. 
(^Mountford^) , (^Who is this, my Lord^) Mohun? (^Yes^) , saith he,  #
(^it is. What maketh your Lordship 
here at this time of night^) ? saith my Lord (^Mohun^) , (^I suppose #
you are sent for^) Mr. Mountford. 
(^No indeed^) , said he, I (^came by chance^) . Saith my Lord, (^You #
have heard of the Business of Mrs.^)
Bracegirdle. With that, after he had said this, Mr. (^Hill^) cometh  #
up, and saith, (^Pray, 
my Lord, hold your Tongue, this is not a convenient time to          #
discourse this Business^) , and would 
have drawn my Lord away. Saith Mr. (^Mountford^) , (^I am very sorry #
my Lord, to see that 
your Lordship should assist Capt.^) Hill (^in so ill an Action as    #
this; pray, let me desire your Lordship 
to forbear^) . Upon this, as soon as he had said so, Mr. (^Hill^)    #
came up and struck Mr.
(^Mountford^) a Box on the Ear. Saith Mr. (^Mountford^) , (^Damme,   #
what's that for^) ? And with 
that, he whipped out his Sword and made a Pass at him, and I turned  #
about and 
cry'd out (^Murder, Murder^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] But you say, you saw (^Hill^) draw his     #
Sword, and make a Pass at 
him.
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] No, his Sword was drawn before; but he      #
immediately after the Box on
Ear, made a Pass at him, and I turned about and cry'd (^Murder^) .
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Had  Mr. (^Mountford^) his Sword drawn at  #
that time?
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer,^) $] No, he had not.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Are you sure he had not?
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] Yes, I am sure he had not, for as soon as   #
he struck the Blow, he made
a Pass at him.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Was my Lord present at that time?
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] He stood just by on the Right-hand.
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] How near to them?
   [$Mrs. (^Brewer.^) $] [^SOURCE TEXT: Mr. (^Brewer.^) ^] They were #
all close together as well as I could discern.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] My Lord, have you any mind to ask this   #
Witness any Questions?
   [$L. (^Mohun.^) $] No, my Lord.
   [$ (^L. H. Steward.^) $] Have you done with her?
   [$Mr. (^Att. Gen.^) $] Yes, my Lord. The next Witness we desire   #
to call is Mr. (^Davenport^) , the
Constable.
