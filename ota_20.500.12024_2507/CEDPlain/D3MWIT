[}A
DIALOGUE
BETWEEN
VVIT AND VVEALTH.}]

   [$ (^Wat.^) $] 
Care I for thy worldly trash? not a rush:
tell not mee of thy millions, thousands, and
hundreds: I prayse my (bountifull) starres
I have an inbred treasury, not valuable in
respect of that which thou countest good.
   [$ (^Davy,^) $] I, I, talk on, talk on; it seemes thou art
neither acquainted with wealth, nor (what thou
brag'st of most) wit; for thou art quite beside thy
Arethmatick, putting the cart before the horse:
millions first, and hundreds last: a preposterous
Argument, suitable to thy disposition.
   [$ (^Wat:^) $] Why? I tell thee (foole) I am soe
weaned from the very conception of any thought
<P 3>
concerning Riches, that tis noe wonder, if all
words spoken by mee on that hatefull subject
prove to be abortive.
   [$ (^Da.^) $] How doest thou live then, I prithee?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] By my wit, I tell thee, and hold it a
farre richer Patrimony then all thy gold can
make thee soe much as capable of.
   [$ (^Da.^) $] Marry I tell thee in my conceit thou'st
but a very bad trade on't now. What canst thou
expect to get by thy wit, in an age which regards
neither wit, honesty, conscience, humanity,
Noble-Ancestrey, nor indeed (to bee briefe) any
thing; but what I am Master of, (and by which
I can accomplish whatsoever my thoughts
would acquire) and that is money, the darling
of the time, the conquerour of Conquerers, the
Coyner of Honesty, and the Muzzell of
Eloquence?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] O brave (^Davy^) , why now I perceive
the case is much altered since I saw thee last, I
doe not think but thou haste bought (and read)
(^Greens Groats worth of Wit^) , or (rather) (^Wits
Common-wealth^) ; why thy phrase and
manners is quite changed from what was wont to
bee, or I now expected, I do not think but thou
art become one of the wits of the times, all thy
usuall Dialect was (^ (\Opus\) ^) & (^ (\usus\)  ^) , or (^ (\Noverint
<P 4>
universi, &c.\) ^) but now let me see what is't the
Darling of the Time, Conquerour of
Conquerers, Muzzle of Eloquence; O rare stile! but
tell me (^Davy^) , is all this Rhethorick proper to
Pelf?
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] This quotha? why I'd have thee to know
(^Wat^) , that these golden phrases, and thousands
more daily in use are the very children of drosse
(as thou callest it) Subjects of silver, Servants
and slaves of gold: why man didst never heare
talke of golden Boyes, Girles worth gold, and
penny white, brown bread Lasses? I'm sure thou
hast (^Wat^) .
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] I marry have I, what then? are all
these Epethits equivalent with an admirable
wit, a quaint conceit, a curious delivery, an
exquisite device, an elaborate stile, and a gallant
humour?
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Tush, what of all this? why, I say
againe and againe, and as many times againe as
thou wilt, that all this, and as much as thou canst
sum up between Shrove-tide and Easter, are but
Lent by the benevolence of industrious gold and
silver, does not money buy Learning? and (I
prethee) does not learning make Divines, 
Lawyers, Phisitians, Phylosophers, Poets, and what
not? (^ (\Ergo\) ^) , no mony no Master, no Master no
<P 5>
Scholler; for it is an old Proverb, (^No penny,
no Paternoster^) ; therefore (^Wat^) leave off thy
bragging of wit, least thou prove thy self a fool,
in preferring it before wealth, which is (as it
were) a creator of Wit.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] I protest (^Davy^) , though indeed I never
held thee to bee very wise, yet I tell thee, I
never expected such a vacuity of discretion, as now
thou hast bewrayed in thy last discourse, out
upon thee, hold thy tongue for shame, till thou learn
how to use it better: I vow I'me asham'd of
thee.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Why Sirrah? tell me patiently, I beleeve
in truth this is but a flourish of wit, a meere
whimsie to daunt me, and make mee leave off,
but in faith thou art a younger brother in that,
all thy witty flashes cannot beat me off from my
ground, I say still, that wealth is to be preferred
before wit, as being (in a manner) the very nurse
and foster father of it, all these thy bravadoes
shall never beat me off, while I can speak my
minde to maintain it.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] I marry, thou hast spun a fine thred
indeed, thy argument is even as strong as a
Spiders web, which thou shalt see me presently blow
away, and dissolve with a blast from my mouth;
thou hast spoken like a meere Dody-pole as thou
<P 6>
art, in seeking to prove that Wealth buyes
Learning, and Learning creates wit, when it
is apparently seen to the contrary; onely this
I confesse that Literature is a most necessary
handmaid to the Muses, without which (indeed)
they cannot be well dressed, but (^ (\Poe`ta nasci ut
non fit\) ^) , a Poet is so born, not so made, for
unlesse a man have an inbred and naturall
proclivity, what boots all his Learning? nay rather,
doth it not render him more odious to his
auditors, who expecting the Nut of Learning, finde
nothing but the shell of guilded ignorance, like
a Jay deck'd in Peacocks feathers, a Sow with
a gold ring in her snout, and a Millers Asse,
garnished with the rich saddle and trappings of
(^Beucephalus^) , doth not the experience of all ages
ratifie this? speak man.
   [$ (^Davy,^) $] Thou wouldst inforce me to beleeve
so, but I neither can nor will, without
particulars to confirm thy words more then a generall
saying that it is so, therefore I absolutely deny
the Argument to be good unlesse thou canst
instance some pregnant proofe to justifie thy
assertion.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] That I can very readily doe, not
needing to trouble thee with precedent men & times,
but even turning to those now living in this
<P 7>
present age, and of them one most eminent may
serve to dignifie a multitude of others more
obscure: what thinkest thou of that notable (only)
English Poet (^John Taylor^) , how many sublime
and (truely) witty Poems hath hee published in
Print? raising a Pyramides to his never
dying memory, of an ingenuous fertile braine
without any addition of learning worth 
mention: but what his own industrious (and inbred)
capacity hath possest him of; what curry-combs
hath hee taken out of the Iron-mongers own
shop to dresse the (ill-conditioned) Iade withall?
how artificially hath he rosted and broyled him
upon his own spits, and grid-irons, how hath
hee fry'd and toss'd him in his own frying-pan,
basted him with his own ladle, and boyl'd him
like a Calves-head and Bacon in his own
pottage-pot? Now I prethee judge impartially of
this; the one vaunts much of great learning
(which thou sayest is bought with money) the
other professeth himself to be guilty of very
little (if any) and yet how different their writings
are, having (with all possible acerbity prest the
Presse against each other, the world hath
censured already, and so doe thou now.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Why, is not the Iron-monger
counted for a pregnant witty fellow? I think he is,
<P 8>
he hath published (and doth weekly) a number
of Pamphlets, which some like exceeding well.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Why, I tell thee hee hath no wit, but a
kinde of railing invention; was ever any age
guilty of producing such a firebrand of
mischiefe? what pestiferous incentives hath hee
writen and published, to stir up sedition betwixt
the King and his people, while it is to be feared
hee is really true to neither.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Well then, leaving this discourse, let us
proceed to something (in my conceit) more
pertinent to our purpose, which shall bee this:
whether Wit or Wealth (as I touched in the
beginning) will best feed and cloath a man?
answer me to that briefly and plainly; here's the
case, thou hast Wit enough, and I have Wealth
enough; now which of them affords the best
maintenance, there lies the state of the question,
I hold my principle still, Wealth is to be 
preferred before Wit?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] And I will confidently defend the
precedency of Wit before Wealth, as being a
divine and supernaturall gift, which mony can
never purchase.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] That's confest but neverthelesse thou
canst not deny but Wealth is a Divine gift, as
well as Wit, is it not? doth not holy writ
<P 9>
mention many godly men, very rich?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] I prethee (^Davy^) let holy Writ alone in
our quarrell, for I love not to mix holy and
prophane matters together, but if thou shouldest
hedge in them to make thy fence the stronger,
the examples are so few, in comparison of
others, that have abandoned riches to imbrace
contemplation in poverty; that the difference
would easily appeare; to what end thinkest thou
did my Couzen (^Crates^) that witty Phylosopher,
throw all his wealth (which was abundance)
into the Sea; was it not because it was an
impediment to his study, and our Poets in
imitation of him, if they be possest with any worldly
trash (as loathing to keep it) doe they not drown
it in Sack, as he drowned his in the Sea? what
should he doe with wealth, who hates it in
comparison of his study? the Muses children ne're
turn Usurers, nor care they for coyn, but for
necessity, all besides is superfluous.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] This is all true (I confesse) but tell me
one thing (^Wat^) , how if thou should'st come to
be sick, lame, cast in prison, or feel any such kind
of affliction, can thy wit ease or release thee, will
the Phisitians, or Gaolers, take learned Epistles,
or witty Poems, in lieu of their fees, canst thou
in rime shew them a reason why they should
<P 10>
deliver thee without money? nay, Ile goe a
nearer and easier way with thee, canst thou by
such meanes procure any palliation or 
mitigation to (or of) thy misery, will they be mollified
with Madrigalls, softned with Sonets, entreated
with Epigrams overcome with Odes? tell mee
seriously, (^Wat^) , what think'st thou? whether will
Wit or Wealth (in such sad exigents) stand thee
in the most stead?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] This touches home I protest, thou
never graveld'st me till now, yet Ile beare up still;
and suppose that reliefe may be gain'd by Art;
for if (^Orpheus^) had power with his dulced
harmony to convert salvage beasts from their
naturall (and customary) truculency, can it be
imagined that men (such as are Phisitians or
Gaolers) should be more barbarous then bruit beasts,
more salvage then Satyres, more cruel then
Caniballs, and more inhumane then Incubuses,
have I clench'd the nayle (^Davy^) , what sayest
thou?
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Very sleightly, (^Wat^) , nay, now I
perceive thou beginnest to yeeld, I have beat thee
out of thy play; run thee off o'thy legges, put
thee besides thy Text, turn'd thee out of tune,
and whipt thee to confession of thy folly, yeeld
up the [^SOURCE TEXT DAMAGED: A WORD BEGINNING WITH "b"              #
OBLITERATED^] (^Wat^) for in truth thou art utterly
<P 11>
foyl'd in thy argument, art thou not?
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Ne're the sooner for a hasty word,
(^Davy^) , I confesse that I doubt some of this is too
true, but howsoever, (^Davy^) , let mee have tryall
by thy own Law, thou didst put me to
particular proofes in a generall plain case, the like I
claime of thee.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Very willingly, (^Wat^) , but let one
include many as thou servedst mee (about (^Iohn
Taylor^) ) there is an honest man, a very good
friend of mine, and one whom thou knowest
very well (but he shall now goe namelesse) he is
(by many) accounted to have an indifferent
portion of wit, but in this sad predicament being a
close prisoner in (^ (\Aulum Iustitia\) ^) , belonging to
(^ (\Nova Porta\) ^) ) he is altogether destitute of mony,
and consequently of friends; all shunning him
(as a man utterly forlorn and forsaken;) nay,
which is most (and worst) of all: Some to whom
the key of his wit (when he was at liberty) did,
in a manner, open the doore to their earthly
happinesse (I think they expect no heavenly) now
in his distressed captivity, doe utterly abandon his
sight not vouchsafing to visit him with money
due to him, nor giving him former imployment,
what sayest thou to this, (^Wat^) , wilt thou yet
grant me the Victory?
<P 12>
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Truely I am heartily sorry, that thou
givest mee such (a failing) occasion; especially
considering that he is an intimate acquaintance
of mine (as thou sayest he is) tush, I am not
absolutely induced to beleeve it; yet indeed this
present age hath gotten the start of all precedent
times for ingratitude, hypocrisie, hardnesse of
heart, neglect of lawdable Arts (and Customes,)
and indeed want of common honesty; but let
mee see, I was about to ask thee how the
Gaolers use him (for that was our argument before)
but 'tis needlesse discourse for if his professed and
obliged friends, are so ingratefully cruell, a man
may almost conclude it as an Article that his
wit or honesty will but little prevaile with the
Keepers without that which makes the Mare to
goe.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Why so I said before, and yet [^"t" IN "yet" NOT  #
SEEN IN SOURCE TEXT^] in troth [^SOURCE TEXT: introth^] ,
(^Wat^) , I must needs (in his case) vary something
from my first principle: for his particular hee
hath found unexpected favour from his Keepers
(whether wone by his wit, honesty, or both, I
question not) for were not their hearts softned
in consideration of his condition which is
without paralell) he had been cast into the common
Gaole before this time, there to have perished
without any remedy.
<P 13>
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Well, (^Davy^) , me thinks yet I smell the
victory as hot in my nostrils as a Beare does
honey in a marrow-bone: hast not thou confest
it thy self? dost not thou (with pitying his case,
withall) conclude that his wit and honesty
procure him favour without money? what can be
more cleare? a ha (^Davy^) ? have I taken you tardy
ath' last? come yeild, yeild.
   [$ (^Dav.^) $] Well (^Wat^) : I perceive that if I give thee
an Inch thou'lt take an Ell: but I prithee don't
vaunt before the victory: suppose I have granted
that the Keepers are kind to him beyond
customary use? wilt thou therefore runne away with
the argument, as though the poore man might
not be better us'd for money, if he had it? away
with thee, thou a (^Wity-pole^) , thou a (^Dody-pole^) ,
(as thou call'st me) thou hast absolutely brought
thy self into a Meander of folly; from which all
thy pretended Wit cannot deliver thee.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] O brave (^Davy^) , I protest I think the
rich fool will carry't when all is done.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Rich fool quotha, marry, (^Wat^) , as the
world goes now adaies, he's most wise (or wity,
or what thou wilt call it) that can keep a penny
for a rainy day (as the Proverb sayes) come, come
(^Wat^) , have thou wit to save thy money when
thou hast it, thou'lt brook thy name the better
<P 14>
by't, doe not stand upon a vain opinion of living
by thy wit, I tell thee thou mayest as well turn
Chamelion and live by the aire, consider with thy
self, the condition of people though they speak
faire in prosperity, while the golden sun or the
silver Moon of thy fortunes, reflect upon them,
what will they doe, or what will they say when
those refulgent Luminaries are set or eclipsed,
Faith if thou wantst either meat, drink, or
apparell, so thou mayst, till new Lights be recovered,
if thou owe money, wit will not pay it, thats
certaine.
[^WAT'S VERSE OMITTED.^]
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Then, (^Wat^) , it seems all these reasons
don't move thee to retract thy sayings.
[^WAT'S VERSE OMITTED.^]
<P 15>
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Well (^Wat^) , thou hast got two strings
to thy bow, what thou canst not get with
reason thou'lt have in rime, well, Ile yeeld on one
condition.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] What's that, a request that is
reasonable, or rimeable, speak?
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] Both, I desire a Song before we part,
that shall end our controversie.
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Wilt thou not be angry? may I sing
what comes at my tongues end.
   [$ (^Davy.^) $] I, I, what comes next let's have it, I
prethee honest (^Wat^) .
   [$ (^Wat.^) $] Then have at it, 't shall bee extempore,
a tryall of Wit.
