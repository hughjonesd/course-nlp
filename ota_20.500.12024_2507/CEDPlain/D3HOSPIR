[}THE 
SPIRITUALL COURTS
EPITOMIZED.}]
   [$ (^Busie body.^) $] 
Wee are utterly undone, this Parliament hath not
only rendred us contemptible to the world, but
hath deprived us of our practice: the Kings Advocate
hath not got a fee for an (^ (\Ex-Officio\) ^) businesse this halfe
yeere: my selfe have drawne no Articles against one
that repeated Sermons with his family this 
twelve-moneth: my Lord of (^Canterbury^) , might have spared
the making of a table of fees, hee needed not to have
turn'd out the Register for extortion, unlesse the issue
had bin better.
   [$ (^Scrap all,^) $] 'Tis true M. (^Busie body^) , but we doe not
suffer an Eclipse in the high Commission onely, but in all
other Courts. (^Bow Church^) that on a Court day us'd to
be fuller then at a Sermon on a Sunday, and the 
Audience Court in (^Pauls^) , where a man could not heare with
his owne eares: the Prerogative, Consistory, and
Arch-Deacons, with the Deane and Chapters Courts,
that were wont to be crowded like money into an
<P 2>
Usurers bag, are very quiet and peaceable now; we cannot
talke false Latine now, but it will bee understood, wee
cannot get ten pounds in part for the probate of a wil,
as corpulent M Copper-nose our Brother, the English
Proctor could, we cannot put (^Ponsonbies^) name to
Articles, for incontinency, with the privity of the Judge, as
heretofore we could, and then compound for the
penance our selves, as we have done with the Judge before
for his sentence.
   [$ (^Busie-body.^) $] No more can we send our Messengers into
the Countrey, that pry into peoples actions there, as
Alderman (^Abells^) spirits would into a But of
unlicensed wine. You know when many Articles were drawne
in the name of (^ (\me necessarii promotoris Officii\) ^) , against  #
any
that we knew was rich, upon no ground at all, but hope
that he would refuse to take his oath, either to accuse
or forsweare himselfe, if he did refuse, then we would
be paid our fees; M. Advocate for perusing and
subscribing the Articles, a Peece, thats two fees, when it
was all but one labour, my selfe for drawing 'm, 
running up and downe, sending my man, and twenty pains
more, that Heaven knowes I never tooke, my fees
treble, and the Office would be carefull enough for their
fees, for expedition for extraordinary attenda~ce, bonds
and twenty things more, they would not want much of
twenty times their fees, and then hee remaining
obstinate, my Lords Grace would deale with him as he did
with others, into prison with him, no redemption. O
money causes were pure good ones; a parson would
spend more money, by delay, then the benefice is
worth. We could not endure Alimonie, many of
them were (^ (\in forma pauperis\) ^) .
<P 3>
   [$ (^Scrape-all.^) $] A pox upon 'em, I had rather the Judge wold
have given sentence against my Clyent then bestowed a 
(^Pauper^) on me, I am sure the creature if he follow'd not
his own busines better then I, he would have a cold
bargaine of it, for my part I fitted him, but sometimes he
would present a (^George^) or the like to my man, and if he
lookt after it so, if not (^ (\Vale pauper\) ^) , I got very well by
a wench that has beene undone in a darke entry. Sir (^Iohn^)
would commit her penance into ten pounds, towards
the repaire of (^Pauls^) , and then we would share it. A
shop doore could not be open on a holy-day, but the
next Sunday the Church was saluted with a (^ (\Coram nobis\) ^) ,
and if he did not appeare, whether he heard of it or no,
(^ (\Dominus eum in scriptis excommunicavit\) ^) . Let him appeare
when he would, he must tender downe his contumacie
fees, or he remaines and is accounted (^ (\pro 
excommunicato\) ^) , and when he is restor'd (^ (\Christi            # 
fidelium\) ^) , he must pay
the Officers fees, faith such businesses were pretty
toyes.
   [$ (^Busie-body.^) $] And I have gain'd well by a poore will,
when the estate has not amounted to above fortie
pounds, I would perswade the executor for
confirmation to prove it (^ (\per testes\) ^) , but first it must be #
proved in
(^ (\Communi forma\) ^) , and by that time some twenty markes
or such a sum would redound to me out o'the forty,
I ne're car'd much for an Administration.
   [$ (^Scrape-all.^) $] But I did, for I would get more by it, the
Inventary (which my man should ingrose, as if one
word were affraid of another) the account & the (^ (\quietus
est\) ^) , and the gratuity, (which I never fayld of) then you
could by an Ordinary will. All (^Bloomsbury^) , (^Coven garden^) ,
(^Long-acre^) , (^Beech-lane^) , were as fearefull of me, as of a
<P 4>
Constable or (^Justice-Long^) [^NO ITALICS FOR Justice IN SOURCE     #
TEXT^] , many a time have I stept
in with 'em for my fees, and have had all content
possible. I should have thought it an ill day i'the vocation
if I had not got a peece.
   [$ (^Busie-body.^) $] Oh brother you would not beleeve how I
delighted in a Commission, which I would goe into th'
Country withall, and expedite, and if they would not
give me ten pounds for it, (which if a Country
Proctor had done, he would not have required above a 
peece) I would not make many delayes for the matter,
but have got it taxt by any Surrogate (whom I could
perswade) to twelve or foureteene pounds, a motion
flies downe and an excommunication after it, and so I
liv'd in as much state as (^Augustus Caesar^) , or'e your
Country, Commissions would afford good profit.
   [$ (^Scrape-all.^) $] Faith brother, and I have cheated many
of my brethren inth' Country, who used to send me up
businesses ready roasted, I would pretend caveats were
entred, and detaine the businesse in my hands a weeke
longer then the time, and then make them pay me as
fully for them, as if my man had ingrost them himselfe.
   [$ (^Busie-body.^) $] O but I was as good at an appeale as could
be, for when the cause was ready for sentence, if I
thought the adverse party would not appeale, if sentence
went against him, I would perswade the Judge to give
sentence against my Client, and then I would be sure to
appeale, and when I had appealed, my Bill would
exceed a Taylors; there would be (^ (\Pro solicitatione, pro
sportulagio pro privato sigillo\) ^) , and (^ (\pro\) ^) twenty      #
things more
that were never done. A notable merry fellow had a
poore cause appealed thrice: and then the adverse 
party got a Commission of review my Client, still
<P 5>
having sentence, which when he told, how his enemy had
appealed so often, and was yet gone further: sayes he,
I have a Proctor that will follow to th'Divell, (if I
whip him with a silver Lash. And on my conscience I
should have lookt as scurvily upon a poore Client as
a Beggar does upon a Beadle, or a whipping post, for
Gods sake brother how long is it since these blessings
faild?
   [$ (^Scrape-all.^) $] Faith ever since the Parliament begun, or
rather before. At the visitation at Saint (^Magnus^)
Church, when Doctor (^Ducke^) was hunted dry foot into
the water, where had he not dived, the Spanels, would
have tore him in peeces, they catcht hold of his legs
and made them swell extreamely, ever since that time we
have bin held in most speciall contempt; your whores
that would have hang'd themselves before to please us,
now call us civill villaines, our Law, the bawdy Courts,
and they that have preserv'd our Bills, now show them
us, and expect restoration, nay the (^ (\ultimum refugium\) ^)
fails us now. That is, to bring a boy with fifty or 
three-score pounds, or within a yeer or two turne him away,
but keepe his monie; this is a blacke tune for us: ten
groats give in a licence now makes me as jocound as a 
gratuity of ten pound would before. Can not you
devise what course is to be taken?
   [$ (^Busie-body.^) $] Now, (^If^) (^I^) could draw a prohibition, #
(^I'de^) [^IN SOURCE TEXT ONLY "I" IN "If" AND "I'de" IS ITALICISED^]
leave my Sheepskin-hood, and convert it into a
Buckram bag, a (^Westminster^) Atturney lives a Kings life now,
however I am (if the oath (^&c.^) shot out of our new
Canons does not strik us quite dead) get acquaintance with
parish Clearks, & keep a horse that can smel out a
testament, if my brother Coppernose would die once, (^I^)
<P 6>
would be made free of the Girdlers, and beg the
probation of Citizens and Aldermens wils:
if all faile me, (^Ile^) [^IN SOURCE TEXT ONLY "I" IN "Ile" IS       #
ITALICISED^] flye after Doctor
(^Roane^) into (^France^) , and than 
wee'l eate Capons and
revive our living.
