[^MOLL'S NURSE SPEAKS TO MOLL, WHO DOES NOT WANT TO GO INTO
SERVICE.^]
[^---^] Thou foolish Child, [$says she,$] thou art 
always Crying; [$ (for I was Crying then) $] prethee, 
What doest Cry for? because they will take me 
away, [$ (^says I^) ,$] and put me to Service, and I
can't Work House-Work; well Child, [$says 
she,$] but tho' you can't Work House-Work,
as you call it, you will learn it in time,
and they won't put you to hard Things at first;
yes they will, [$says I,$] and if I can't do it, they
will Beat me, and the Maids will Beat me to
make me do great Work, and I am but a little
Girl, and I can't do it, [$and then I cry'd again,
till I could not speak any more to her.$] 
[^THE NURSE PROMISES THAT MOLL WILL NOT GO INTO SERVICE UNTIL SHE 
IS OLDER.^]
   [$WHEN she saw that I was not pacify'd yet, she
began to be angry with me,$] and what wou'd you
have? [$ (^says she^) ,$] don't I tell you that you shall not
go to Service till you are bigger? Ay, [$says I,$] but
then I must go at last, why, what? [$said she,$] is the
Girl mad? what, would you be a Gentlewoman?
Yes [$ (^says I^) , and cry'd heartily, till I roar'd out
again.
<P 7>
   THIS set the old Gentlewoman a Laughing
at me, as you may be sure it would:$] Well,
Madam forsooth, [$says she, (^Gibing at me^) ,$] you would
be a Gentlewoman, and pray how will you come
to be a Gentlewoman? what, will you do it by
your Fingers Ends?
   YES, [$ (^says I again^) , very innocently.$]
   Why, what can you Earn, [$ (^says she^) ,$] what can
you get at your Work?
   THREE-Pence, [$ (^said I^) ,$] when I Spin, and 4 (^d.^)
when I Work plain Work.
   ALAS! poor Gentlewoman, [$ (^said she again^) ,
Laughing,$] what will that do for thee?
   IT will keep me, [$ (^says I^) ,$] if you will let me
live with you; [$and this (^I said^) , in such a poor
petitioning Tone, that it made the poor Womans
Heart yearn to me, as she told me afterwards.$]
   But, [$ (^says she^) ,$] that will not keep you, and buy you
Cloths too; and who must buy the little
Gentlewoman Cloths, [$ (^says she^) , and smil'd all the while at
me.$]
   I will Work Harder then, [$ (^says I^) ,$] and you shall
have it all.
   POOR Child! it won't keep you, [$ (^says she^) ,$] it will
hardly keep you in Victuals.
   THEN I will have no Victuals? [$ (^says I^) , again
very Innocently,$] let me but live with you.
   WHY, can you live without Victuals? [$ (^says she^) ,$] 
yes, [$ (^again says I^) , very much like a Child, you may
be sure, and still I cry'd heartily.
   I HAD no Policy in all this, you may easily
see it was all Nature, but it was joyn'd with so
much Innocence, and so much Passion, That in
short, it set the good Motherly Creature a
weeping too, and she cry'd at last as fast as I did, and then
took me, and led me out of the teaching Room;$]
<P 8>
come [$ (^says she^) ,$] you shan't go to Service, you shall
live with me, [$and this pacify'd me for the present.
   SOMETIME after this, she going to wait on
the (^Mayor^) , and talking of such things as belong'd
to her Business, at last my Story came up, and my
good Nurse told Mr. (^Mayor^) the whole Tale: He
was so pleas'd with it, that he would call his
Lady, and his two Daughters to hear it, and it made
Mirth enough among them, you may be sure [^SOURCE TEXT: besure^] .
   HOWEVER, not a Week had pass'd over, but
on a suddain comes Mrs. (^Mayoress^) , and her two
Daughters to the House to see my old Nurse, and
to see her School and the Children: When they
had look'd about them a little:$] Well, Mrs. ------
[$says the (^Mayoress^) to my Nurse;$] and pray
which is the little Lass that intends to be a
Gentlewoman? [$I heard, her and I was terrible
frighted at first, tho' I did not know why neither; but
Mrs. (^Mayoress^) comes up to me,$] Well Miss [$says
she,$] And what are you at Work upon? [$The Word
Miss was a Language that had hardly been
heard of in our School, and I wondred what sad
Name it was she call'd me; However, I stood up,
made a Curtsy, and she took my Work out of
my Hand, look'd on it, and said it was very well;
then she took up one of my Hands,$] nay, [$says
she,$] the Child may come to be a Gentlewoman
for ought any body knows, she has a
Gentlewoman's Hand, [$says she;$] [^---^]
[^MOLL AND THE NURSE DISCUSS BEING A GENTLEWOMAN: MOLL MENTIONS A
WOMAN WHO MENDS LACE AND IS CALLED "MADAM".^]
<P 10>
   POOR Child, [$says my good old Nurse,$] you
may soon be such a Gentlewoman as that, for she
is a Person of ill Fame, and has had two or three
Bastards.
   [$I DID not understand any thing of that; but
I answer'd,$] I am sure they call her Madam, and
she does not go to Service, nor do House-Work, [$and
therefore I insisted that she was a Gentlewoman,
and I would be such a Gentlewoman as that.$]

<S SAMPLE 2>
<P 17>
[^MOLL WORKS IN A FAMILY, WHERE SHE IS COURTED BY THE ELDEST SON.^]
[^---^] [$His Sisters
would return softly to him,$] Hush Brother, she
will hear you, she is but in the next Room; [$then he
would put it off, and Talk softlier, as if he had not
known it, and begun to acknowledge he was Wrong;
and then as if he had forgot himself, he would speak
aloud again, and I that was so well pleas'd to hear
it, was sure to Lissen for it upon all
Occasions.
   AFTER he had thus baited his Hook, and found
easily enough the Method how to lay it in my Way,
he play'd an opener Game; and one Day going by
his Sister's Chamber when I was there, doing
something about Dressing her, he comes in with an Air
of gayty,$] O! Mrs. (^Betty^) , [$said he to me,$] How do you
do Mrs. (^Betty^) ? don't your Cheeks burn, Mrs.
(^Betty^) ? [$I made a Curtsy, and blush'd, but said nothing;$]
What makes you talk so Brother, [$ (^says the Lady^) ;$]
Why, [$says he,$] we have been talking of her below
Stairs this half Hour; (^Well^) [$ (^says his Sister^) ,$] you can
say no Harm of her, that I am sure, so 'tis no
matter what you have been talking about; nay, [$ (^says
he^) ,$] 'tis so far from talking Harm of her, that we
have been talking a great deal of good, and a
great many fine Things have been said of Mrs.
(^Betty^) , I assure you; and particularly, that she is the
<P 18>
Handsomest young Woman in (^Colchester^) ; and, in
short, they begin to Toast her Health in the
Town.
   I wonder at you Brother, [$ (^says the Sister^) ;$] (^Betty^)
wants but one Thing, but she had as good want
every Thing, for the Market is against our Sex
just now; and if a young Woman have Beauty,
Birth, Breeding, Wit, Sense, Manners, Modesty,
and all these to an Extream; yet if she have not 
Money, she's no Body, she had has good want
them all, for nothing but Money now
recommends a Woman; the Men play the Game all into
their own Hands.
   [$HER younger Brother, who was by, cry'd$] (^Hold
Sister^) , you run too fast, I am an Exception to your
Rule; I assure you, if I find a Woman so
Accomplish'd as you Talk of, (^I say^) , I assure you, I
would not trouble myself about the Money.
   (^O^) , [$ (^says the Sister^) ,$] but you will take Care not
to Fancy one then, without the Money.
   YOU don't know that neither, [$ (^says the
Brother^) .$]
   BUT why Sister, [$ ( (^says the elder Brother^) ) $] why
do you exclaim so at the Men, for aiming so
much at the Fortune? you are none of them that
want a Fortune, what ever else you want.
   I understand you Brother, [$ ( (^replies the Lady
very smartly^) ,) $] you suppose I have the Money,
and want the Beauty; but as Times go now, the
first will do without the last, so I have the better
of my Neighbours.
   WELL, [$ (^says the younger Brother^) ,$] but your
Neighbours, as you call them may be even with
you for Beauty; will steal a Husband sometimes
in spight of Money; and when the Maid chances
to be Handsomer than the Mistress, she
<P 19>
oftentimes makes as good a Market, and rides in a
Coach before her.
[^MOLL LEAVES THE ROOM BUT SHE CAN HEAR THE CONVERSATION: SHE
UNDERSTANDS THAT THE SISTER DISLIKES HER.^]
   [$IT happen'd one Day that he came running up
Stairs, towards the Room where his Sisters us'd to
sit and Work, as he often us'd to do; and calling to
them before he came in, as was his way too, I
being there alone, step'd to the Door, and said,$] Sir,
the Ladies are not here, they are Walk'd down
the Garden; [$as I step'd forward, to say this
towards the Door, he was just got to the Door, and
clasping me in his Arms, as if it had been by Chance,$]
O! Mrs. (^Betty^) , [$ (^says he^) ,$] are you here? that's better
still; I want to speak with you, more than I do with
them, [$and then having me in his Arms he Kiss'd
me three or four times.
   I struggl'd to get away, and yet did it but
faintly neither, and he held me fast, and still
<P 20>
Kiss'd me, till he was almost out of Breath, and
then sitting down, says,$] (^dear Betty^) I am in Love
with you.
   [$HIS Words I must confess fir'd my Blood; all
my Spirits flew about my Heart, and put me into
Disorder enough, which he might easily have seen
in my Face: He repeated it afterwards several
times, that he was in Love with me, and my Heart
spoke as plain as a Voice, that I lik'd it; nay, when
ever he said,$] I am in Love with you, [$my Blushes
plainly reply'd,$] (^wou'd you were^) Sir.

<S SAMPLE 3>
<P 26>
[^MOLL HAS RECEIVED A NOTE FROM THE BROTHER ASKING HER TO GO INTO
TOWN AND THAT HE WILL MEET HER ON THE WAY.^]
   [$ACCORDINGLY after Dinner, he very gravely
says to me, his Sisters being all by,$] Mrs. (^Betty^) , I
must ask a Favour of you: What's that? [$ (^says his
second Sister^) ;$] nay, Sister [$ (^says he^) , very gravely,$] if
you can't spare Mrs. (^Betty^) to Day, any other
time will do; [$ (^yes they said^) , they could spare her
well enough, and the Sister beg'd Pardon for
asking; which she did but of meer Course, without
any Meaning;$] Well, but Brother? [$says the eldest
Sister,$] you must tell Mrs. (^Betty^) what it is; if it be
any private Business, that we must not hear.
You may call her out, there she is, why Sister,
[$says the Gentleman, very gravely,$] What do you
mean? (^I^) only desire her to go into the (^High-street^) ,
[$ (and then he pulls out a Turn-Over) $] to such a Shop,
[$and then he tells them a long Story of two fine
Neckcloths he had bid Money for,$] [^---^]
[^THE BROTHER LIES TO HIS FAMILY IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MEET 
WITH MOLL.^]
<P 27>
   [$HE had scarse done speaking to them, and
giving me my Errand, but his Man came up to tell
him that Sir (^W--H--s^) Coach stop'd at the
Door; so he runs down, and comes up again
immediately,$] alas! [$ (^says he^) , aloud,$] there's all my
Mirth spoil'd at once; Sir (^W--^) has sent his
Coach for me, and desires to speak with me upon
some earnest Business: [^---^]
[^MOLL AND THE BROTHER MEET.^]
<P 28>
   [$HOWEVER as he press'd me to speak, I told
him, I had no Reason to question the Sincerity of
his Love to me, after so many Protestations,
But -- and there I stopp'd, as if I left him to
Guess the rest;$] BUT WHAT my Dear? [$ (^says he^) ,$]
I guess what you mean; what if you should be
with Child, is not that it? Why then, [$ (^says he^) ,$]
I'll take Care of you, and Provide for you,
and the Child too, and that you may see I am
not in Jest, [$ (^says he^) ,$] here's an Earnest for you; [$and
with that he pulls out a silk Purse, with an
Hundred Guineas in it, and gave it me;$] and I'll give
you such another, [$ (^says he^) ,$] every Year till I Marry
you.

<P 35>
[^THE YOUNGER BROTHER BEGINS TO COURT MOLL, WHICH COMES TO THE 
ATTENTION OF THE REST OF THE FAMILY: MOLL IS AFRAID SHE WILL BE 
THROWN OUT AND TELLS THE ELDER BROTHER.^]
   WHY look you Child, [$ (^says he^) ,$] that they are
Uneasie about you, that is true; but that they
have the least Suspicion of the Case as it is, and
as it respects you and I, is so far from bring True,
that they suspect my Brother (^Robin^) ; and in short,
they are fully persuaded he makes Love to you:
Nay, the Fool has put it into their Heads too
himself, for he is continually Bantring them about it,
and making a Jest of himself; I confess, I think
he is wrong to do so, because he can not but see it
vexes them, and makes them Unkind to you; but
'tis a Satisfaction to me, because of the Assurance
it gives me, that they do not suspect me in the
least, and I hope this will be to your Satisfaction
too.
   SO it is, [$ (^says I^) ,$] one way, but this does not reach
my Case at all, nor is this the chief Thing that
Troubles me, tho' I have been concern'd about 
that too: What is it then, [$ (^says he^) ?$] [^...^]
[^MOLL TELLS THE ELDER BROTHER ABOUT THE YOUNGER BROTHER'S
COURTING HER.^]
<P 36>
   [$I (^told him^) how far I had resisted him, and (^told
him^) how Sincere and Honourable his Offers were,$]
but [$ (^says I^) ,$] my Case will be doubly hard; for as
they carry it Ill to me now, because he desires to
have me, they'll carry it worse when they shall
find I have Deny'd him; and they will presently
say, there's something else in it, and then out it
comes, that I am Marry'd already to somebody
else, or else that I would never refuse a Match so
much above me as this was.
[^MOLL AND THE ELDER BROTHER CONTINUE.^]
<P 37>
   WELL my Dear [$ (^says he^) ,$] don't be Concern'd
at that now, if I am not your Husband, I'll be as
good as a Husband to you, and do not let those
things Trouble you now, but let me look a little
farther into this Affair, and I shall be able to say
more next time we meet.
[^MOLL REPEATS THE DISCOURSE BETWEEN THE TWO BROTHERS.^]
[^...^] [$He (^told him^) he heard strange
News of him since he went, ( (^viz.^) ) that he made
Love to Mrs. (^Betty^) :$] Well, [$ (^says his^) Brother, a
little Angrily,$] and so (^I do^) , And what then? What
has any body to do with that? Nay, [$ (^says his^)
Brother,$] don't be Angry (^Robin^) , I don't pretend to
have any thing to do with it; nor do I pretend to
be Angry with you about it: But I find they do
concern themselves about it, and that they have
used the poor Girl Ill about it, which I should
take as done to my self; Who do you mean by
THEY? [$ (^says^) Robin,$] I mean my Mother, and the
Girls, [$ (^says the^) elder Brother.$]
<P 38>
   BUT hark ye, [$ (^says his^) Brother,$] are you in
Earnest, do you really Love the Girl, you may
be free with me you know? Why then [$ (^says^) Robin,$]
I will be free with you, I do Love her above all
the Women in the World, and I will have Her,
let (^them say^) , and do what they will, I believe the
Girl will not Deny me.
   [$IT stuck me to the Heart when he (^told me^) this,
for tho' it was most rational to think I would not
Deny him, yet I knew in my own Conscience, I
must Deny him, and I saw my Ruin in my being
oblig'd to do so; but I knew it was my business
to Talk otherwise then, so I interrupted him in
his Story thus.$]
   AY! [$ (^said I^) ,$] does he think I can not Deny him?
but he shall find I can Deny him, for all that.
   WELL my dear [$ (^says he^) ,$] but let me give you
the whole Story as it went on between us, and then
say what you will.
   [$THEN he went on and (^told me^) , that he reply'd
thus:$] But Brother, you know She has nothing,
and you may have several Ladies with good
Fortunes: 'Tis no matter for that, [$ (^said^) Robin,$] I
Love the Girl; and I will never please my
Pocket in Marrying, and not please my Fancy; and
so my Dear [$ (^adds he^) ,$] there is no Opposing him.
   YES, yes, [$ (^says I^) ,$] you shall see I can Oppose
him, I have learnt to say NO now, tho' I had
not learnt it before; if the best Lord in the Land
offer'd me Marriage now, I could very chearfully
say NO to him.
   WELL, but my Dear [$ (^says he^) ,$] What can you
say to him? You know, as you said when we talk'd
of it before, he will ask you many Questions
about it, and all the House will wonder what the
meaning of it should be.
<P 39>
   WHY [$ (^says I^) smiling,$] I can stop all their Mouths
at one Clap, by telling him and them too, that
I am Married already to his elder Brother.
   [$HE smil'd a little too at the Word, but I could
see it Startled him, and he could not hide the
disorder it put him into; however, he return'd,$]
Why tho' that may be true in some Sense, yet I
suppose you are but in Jest, when you talk of
giving such an Answer as that, it may not be
Convenient on many Accounts.
   NO, no [$ (^says I^) pleasantly,$] I am not so fond of
letting that Secret come out, without your Consent.
   BUT what then can you say to him, or to them,
[$ (^says he^) ,$] when they find you positive against a Match,
which would be apparently so much to your 
Advantage?
   WHY, [$ (^says I^) ,$] should I be at a loss? First of all,
I am not oblig'd to give them any Reason at all,
on the other hand, I may tell them, I am
Married already, and stop there, and that will be a
full Stop too to him, for he can have no Reason
to ask one Question after it.
   AY, [$ (^says he^) ,$] but the whole House will teize
you about that, even to Father and Mother, and if
you deny them positively, they will be Disoblig'd
at you, and Suspicious besides.
   WHY, [$ (^says I^) ,$] What can I do? What would you
have me do? I was in strait enough before, and as
I (^told you^) , I was in Perplexity before, and
acquainted you with the Circumstances, that I
might have your Advice.
   MY dear [$ (^says he^) ,$] I have been considering very
much upon it, you may be sure, and tho' it is a
piece of Advice, that has a great many
Mortifications in it to me, and may at first seem Strange
to you, yet all Things consider'd, I see no better
<P 40>
way for you, than to let him go on; and if you
find him hearty and in Earnest, Marry him.
   [$I gave him a look full of Horror at those Words,
and turning Pale as Death, was at the very point
of sinking down out of the Chair I sat in: When
giving a start,$] my Dear, [$ (^says he^) aloud,$] What's
the matter with you? Where are you  a going?
[$and a great many such things; and with joging
and calling to me, fetch'd me a little to my self,
tho' it was a good while before I fully recover'd
my Senses, and was not able to speak for several
Minutes more.
   WHEN I was fully recover'd he began again;$]
My dear [$ (^says he^) ,$] What made you so Surpriz'd at
what I said, I would have you consider Seriously
of it? you may see plainly how the Family stand
in this Case, and they would be stark Mad if it
was my Case, as it is my Brothers, and for I ought
I see, it would be my Ruin and yours too.
   AY! [$ (^says I^) , still speaking angrily;$] are all your
Protestations and Vows to be shaken by the
dislike of the Family? Did I not always object that
to you, and you made a light thing of it, as
what you were above, and would not Value; and
is it come to this now? [$ (^Said I^) ,$] is this your Faith
and Honour, your Love, and the Solidity of your
Promises?
   [$HE continued perfectly Calm,
notwithstanding all my Reproaches, and I was not sparing of
them at all; but (^he reply'd^) at last,$] My Dear, I
have not broken one Promise with you yet; I did
tell you I would Marry you when I was come to
my Estate; but you see my Father is a hail healthy
Man, and may live these thirty Years still, and
not be Older than several are round us in the
Town; and you never propos'd my Marrying you
<P 41>
sooner, because you know it might be my Ruin,
and as to all the rest, I have not fail'd you in any
thing, you have wanted for nothing.
   [$I could not deny a Word of this, and had
nothing to say to it in general;$] but why then, [$ (^says
I^) ,$] can you perswade me to such a horrid stop, as
leaving you, since you have not left me?
Will you allow no Affection, no Love on my
Side, where there has been so much on your Side?
Have I made you no Returns? Have I given no
Testimony of my Sincerity, and of my Passion? are
the Sacrifices I have made of Honour and Modesty
to you, no Proof of my being ty'd to you in
Bonds too strong to be broken?
   BUT here my Dear, [$ (^says he^) ,$] you may come
into a safe Station, and appear with Honour, and
with splendor at once, and the Remembrance of
what we have done, may be wrapt up in an
eternal Silence, as if it had never happen'd; you shall
always have my Respect, and my sincere
Affection, only then it shall be Honest, and perfectly
Just to my Brother, you shall be my Dear Sister,
as now you are my Dear -- [$and there he stop'd.$]
   YOUR Dear whore, [$ (^says I^) ,$] you would have
said, if you had gone on; and you might as well
have said it; but I understand you: However, I
desire you to remember the long Discourses you
have had with me, and the many Hours pains
you have taken to perswade me to believe myself
an honest Woman; that I was your Wife
intentionally, tho' not in the Eye of the World;
and that it was as effectual a Marriage that had
pass'd between us, as if we had been publickly
Wedded by the Parson of the Parish; you know
and cannot but remember, that these have been 
your own Words to me.
<P 42>
   [$I found this was a little too close upon him,
but I made it up in what follows; he stood stock
still for a while, and said nothing, and I went on
thus;$] you cannot, [$ (^says I^) ,$] without the highest
injustice believe that I yielded upon all these
Perswasions without a Love not to be questioned,
not to be shaken again by any thing that could
happen afterward: If you have such
dishonourable Thoughts of me, I must ask you what
Foundation in any of my Behaviour have I given for such
a Suggestion.
   IF than I have yielded to the Importunities of
my Affection; and if I have been perswaded to
believe that I am really, and in the Essence of
the Thing your Wife, shall I now give the Lye
to all those Arguments, and call myself your
Whore, or Mistress, which is the same thing? And
will you Transfer me to your Brother? Can you
Transfer my Affection? Can you bid me cease
loving you, and bid me love him? is it in my Power
think you to make such a Change at Demand?
No Sir, [$ (^said I^) ,$] depend upon it 'tis impossible, and
whatever the Change of your Side may be, I will
ever be True; and I had much rather, since it is
come that unhappy Length, be your Whore than
your Brothers Wife.
[^THE ELDER BROTHER ASKS MOLL IF SHE IS PREGNANT.^]
<P 43>
   [$I guess'd at his Question presently, namely,
Whether I was sure I was not with Child? As to
that, (^I told him^) , he need not be concern'd about it,
for I was not with Child;$] why then my Dear, [$ (^says
he^) ,$] we have no time to Talk farther now;
consider of it, and think closely about it, I cannot
but be of the Opinion still, that it will be the
best Course you can take; [^---^]

[^MOLL HAS BEEN ILL FOR FIVE WEEKS: THE DOCTORS SUSPECT IT IS BECAUSE
SHE IS IN LOVE, WHICH IS DISCUSSED BY THE FAMILY.^]
   ALAS, [$ (^says the^) old Lady,$] that poor Girl; I am
afraid she will never be well.
   WELL! [$ (^says the^) elder Brother,$] How should
Mrs. (^Betty^) be well, (^they say^) she is in Love?
   I believe nothing of it [$ (^says the^) old 
Gentlewoman.$]
   I don't know [$ (^says the^) eldest Sister,$] what to say
to it, they have made such a rout about her being
so Handsome, and so Charming, and I know not
what, and that in her hearing too, that has turn'd
the Creatures Head I believe, and who knows
what possessions may follow such Doings? for my
Part I don't know what to make of it.
   WHY Sister, you must acknowledge she is
very Handsome, [$ (^says the^) elder Brother.$]
   AY, and a great deal Handsomer than you
Sister, [$ (^says^) Robin,$] and that's your Mortification.
   WELL, well, that is not the Question, [$ (^says his^)
Sister,$] the Girl is well enough, and she knows it
well enough; she need not be told of it to make
her Vain.
   WE are not a talking of her being Vain, [$ (^says
the^) elder Brother,$] but of her being in Love; it
may be she is in Love with herself, it seems my
Sisters think so.
<P 47>
   I would she was in Love with me, [$ (^says^) Robin,$]
I'd quickly put her out of her Pain.
   WHAT d'ye mean by that Son, [$ (^says the^) old
Lady,$] How can you talk so?
   WHY Madam, [$ (^says^) Robin again, very
honestly,$] Do you think I'd let the poor Girl Die for
Love, and of one that is near at hand to be had too.
   FYE Brother, [$ (^says the^) second Sister,$] how can
you talk so? would you take a Creature that has
not a Groat in the World?
   PRETHEE Child [$ (^says^) Robin,$] Beauties a
Portion, and good Humour with it, is a double
Portion; I wish thou hadst half her Stock of both
for thy Portion: [$So there was her Mouth stopp'd.$]
   I find, [$ (^says the^) eldest Sister,$] if (^Betty^) is not in
Love, my Brother is; I wonder he has not broke
his Mind to (^Betty^) , I warrant she won't say NO.
   THEY that yield when they're ask'd [$ (^says^)
Robin,$] are one step before them that were never
ask'd to yield, Sister, and two Steps before them
that yield before they are ask'd: And that's an
Answer to you Sister.
[^THE FAMILY'S DISCUSSION CONTINUES.^]
<P 49>
   She's wrong there, [$ (^says^) Robin,$] for if there
was not a great deal between us, we should be
closer together than we are: I told her I Lov'd
her hugely, [$ (^says he^) ,$] but I could never make the
Jade believe I was in Earnest; I do not know
how you should [$ (^says his^) Mother,$] no body in their
Senses could believe you were in Earnest, to Talk
so to a poor Girl, whose Circumstances you know
so well.
   BUT prethee Son [$ (^adds she^) ,$] since you tell me that
you could not make her believe you were in
Earnest, what must we believe about it? for you ramble
so in your Discourse, that no body knows
whether you are in Earnest or in Jest: But as I find
the Girl by your own Confession has answer'd
truely, I wish you would do so too, and tell me
<P 50>
seriously, so that I may depend upon it; Is there
any thing in it or no? Are you in Earnest or no?
Are you Distracted indeed, or are you not? 'Tis
a weighty Question, and I wish you would make
us easie about it.
   BY my Faith Madam, [$ (^says^) Robin,$] 'tis in vain
to mince the Matter, or tell any more Lyes
about it, I am in Earnest, as much as a Man is, that's
going to be Hang'd. If Mrs. (^Betty^) would say she
Lov'd me, and that she would Marry me, I'd
have her to morrow Morning fasting; and say,
(^To have, and to hold^) , instead of eating my Breakfast.
   WELL, [$ (^says the Mother^) ,$] then there's one Son
lost; and she said it in a very mournful Tone, as
one greatly concern'd at it.
   I hope not Madam, [$ (^says^) Robin,$] no Man is lost,
when a good Wife has found him.
   WHY but Child, [$ (^says the^) old Lady,$] she is a
Beggar.
   WHY then Madam, she has the more need of
Charity [$ (^says^) Robin;$] I'll take her off of the hands
of the Parish, and she and I'll Beg together.
   ITS bad Jesting with such things, [$ (^says the
Mother^) .$]
   I don't Jest Madam, [$ (^says^) Robin:$] We'll come
and beg your Pardon Madam; and your Blessing
Madam, and my Fathers.
   THIS is all out of the way Son, [$ (^says the
Mother^) ,$] if you are in Earnest you are Undone.
   I am afraid not [$ (^says he^) ,$] for I am really afraid
she won't have me, after all my Sisters huffing
and blustring; I believe I shall never be able to
persuade her to it.
   THAT'S a fine Tale indeed, she is not so far
out of her Senses neither; Mrs. (^Betty^) is no Fool,
<P 51>
[$ (^says the youngest Sister^) ,$] Do you think she has learnt
to say NO, any more than other People?
   NO Mrs. (^Mirth-Wit^) [$says Robin,$] Mrs. (^Betty's^)
no Fool; but Mrs. (^Betty^) may be Engag'd some
other way, And what then?
   NAY, [$ (^says the eldest Sister^) ,$] we can say nothing
to that, Who must it be to then? She is never out
of the Doors, it must be between you.
   I have nothing to say to that [$ (^says^) Robin,$] I have
been Examin'd enough; there's my Brother, if
it must be (^between us^) , go to Work with him.
   [$THIS stung (^the elder Brother^) to the Quick,
and he concluded that (^Robin^) had discover'd
something: However, he kept himself from
appearing disturb'd;$] Prethee [$ (^says he^) ,$] don't go to sham
your Stories off upon me, I tell you, I deal in no
such Ware; I have nothing to say to Mrs. (^Betty^) ,
nor to any of the (^Miss Betty's^) in the Parish; [$and
with that he rose up and brush'd off.$]
   NO, [$ (^says the eldest Sister^) ,$] I dare answer for my
Brother, he knows the World better.
   [$THUS the Discourse ended; but it left (^the
elder Brother^) quite confounded: He concluded his
Brother had made a full Discovery, and he began
to doubt, whether I had been concern'd in it, or
not; but with all his Management, he could not
bring it about to get at me; at last, he was so
perplex'd, that he was quite Desperate, and
resolv'd he wou'd come into my Chamber and see
me, whatever came of it: In order to this, he
contriv'd it so; that one Day after Dinner,
watching (^his eldest Sister^) , till he could see her go up
Stairs, he runs after her,$] (^Hark ye Sister^) , [$ (^says he^) ,$]
Where is this sick Woman? may not a body see
her? YES, [$ (^says the Sister^) ,$] I believe you may, but
let me go first a little, and I'll tell you; [$so she
<P 52>
run up to the Door, and gave me notice; and
presently call'd to him again:$] BROTHER, [$ (^says she^) ,$]
you may come if you please; [$so in he came, just
in the same kind of Rant:$] Well, [$ (^says he^) , at the
Door (^as he came in^) ,$] Where is this sick Body that's
in Love? How do ye do Mrs. (^Betty^) ? [$I would have
got up out of my Chair, but I was so Weak I could
not for a good while; and he saw it and his Sister
too, and she said,$] (^Come do not strive to stand up^) , my
Brother desires no Ceremony, especially, now you
are so Weak. NO, NO, Mrs. (^Betty^) , pray sit still
[$ (^says he^) , and so sits himself down in a Chair 
over-against me, and appear'd as if he was mighty
Merry.
   HE talk'd a deal of rambling Stuff to his Sister,
and to me; sometimes of one thing, sometimes
of another, on purpose to Amuse his Sister; and
every now and then, would turn it upon the old
Story, directing it to me:$] Poor Mrs. (^Betty^) , [$ (^says
he^) ,$] it is a sad thing to be in Love, why it has
reduced you sadly; [$at last I spoke a little,$] I am
glad to see you so Merry: Sir [$ (^says I^) ,$] but I think
the Doctor might have found some thing better to
do, than to make his Game at his Patients: If I
had been Ill of no other Distemper, I know the
Proverb too well to have let him come to me:
What Proverb [$ (^says he^) ?$] O! I remember it now:
What,
   (^Where Love is the Case,
   The Doctor's an Ass.^)
   IS not that it Mrs. (^Betty^) ? [$I smil'd, and said
nothing:$] Nay, [$ (^says he^) ,$] I think the effect has prov'd
it to be Love; for it seems the Doctor has been
able to do you but little Service, you mend very
slowly they say, I doubt there's somewhat in it
<P 53>
Mrs. (^Betty^) , I doubt you are Sick of the
Incureables, and that is Love; [$I smil'd and said,$] No,
(^indeed Sir^) , that's none of my Distemper.
   [$WE had a deal of such Discourse, and
sometimes others that signify'd as little; by and by
He ask'd me to Sing them a Song; at which I
smil'd, and said, my singing Days were over:
At last he ask'd me, if he should Play upon his
Flute to me; his Sister said, she believ'd it wou'd
hurt me, and that my Head could not bear it; I
bow'd and said,$] No, it would not hurt me: And 
pray Madam, [$ (^said I^) ,$] do not hinder it, I love the
Musick of the Flute very much; [$then his Sister
said,$] well do then Brother; [$with that he pull'd
out the Key of his Closet,$] Dear Sister, [$ (^says he^) ,$] I
am very Lazy, do step to my Closet and fetch
my Flute, it lies in (^such a Drawer^) , [$naming a
Place where he was sure it was not, that she might
be a little while a looking for it.$]

<P 96>
[^MOLL HAS MARRIED.^]
[^---^] MY DEAR, [$ (^said I^) ,$] we
have been married a Fortnight, is it not time to
let you know whether you have got a Wife with
something, or with nothing; your own time for
that, my Dear, [$ (^says he^) ,$] I am satisfied that I have
got the Wife I love, I have not troubled you
much, [$ (^says he^) ,$] with my enquiry after it.
   THAT'S true, [$ (^said I^) ,$] but I have a great
difficulty upon me about it, which I scarce know how
to manage.
   WHAT'S that, my Dear, [$ (^says he^) ?$]
   WHY, [$ (^says I^) ,$] 'tis a little hard upon me, and
'tis harder upon you; I am told that Captain
-- [$ (meaning my Friend's Husband) $] has told
you I had a great deal more Money than I ever
pretended to have, and I am sure I never employ'd
him to do so.
   WELL, [$ (^says he^) ,$] Captain -- may have told
me so, but what then, if you have not so much
that may lye at his Door, but you never told me
what you had, so I have no reason to blame you
if you have nothing at all.
<P 97>
   THAT is so just, [$ (^said I^) ,$] and so generous, that
it makes my having but a little a double Affliction
to me.
   THE less you have, (^my Dear^) , [$ (^says he^) ,$] the worse
for us both; but I hope your Affliction you speak
of, is not caus'd for fear I should be unkind to
you, for want of a Portion, NO NO, if you have
nothing to tell me plainly, and at once; I may
perhaps tell the Captain he has cheated me, but I
can never say you have cheated me, for did you
not give it under your Hand that you were Poor,
and so I ought to expect you to be.
   WELL, [$said I,$] (^my Dear^) , I am glad I have not
been concern'd in deceiving you before Marriage,
if I deceive you since, 'tis ne'er the worse; (^that I
am Poor^) is too true, but not so Poor as to have
nothing neither; [$so I pull'd out some Bank Bills,
and gave him about a Hundred and Sixty Pounds,$]
there's something, my Dear, [$ (^says I^) ,$] and not quite
all neither.
[^MOLL BRINGS MORE MONEY TO HER HUSBAND.^]
<P 98>
   And now, MY DEAR, [$ (^says I to him^) ,$] I am very
sorry to tell you, that there is all, and that I have
given you my whole Fortune; [$I added, that if
the Person who had my 600 (^l.^) had not abus'd me,
I had been worth a Thousand Pound to him, but
that as it was, I had been faithful to him, and
reserv'd nothing to my self, but if it had been
more he should have had it.$]
[^MOLL AND HER HUSBAND HAVE MOVED TO HIS ESTATE IN VIRGINIA: 
SHE SPEAKS WITH HER MOTHER-IN-LAW.^]
<P 100>
   [$AMONG the rest, she often told me how the
greatest part of the Inhabitants of the Colony
came thither in very indifferent Circumstances
from (^England^) ; that, generally speaking, they
were of two sorts, either (1.) such as were brought
over by Masters of Ships to be sold as Servants,$]
(^such as we call them^) , my Dear, [$ (^says she^) ,$] but they are
more properly call'd (^Slaves^) . [$Or, (2.) Such as are
Transported from (^Newgate^) and other Prisons,
<P 101>
after having been found guilty of Felony and other
Crimes punishable, with Death.$]
   WHEN they come here, [$ (^says she^) ,$] we make no
difference, the Planters buy them, and they work
together in the Field till their time is out; when
'tis expir'd, [$ (^said she^) ,$] they have Encouragement
given them to Plant for themselves; for they have
a certain number of Acres of Land allotted them
by the Country, and they go to work to Clear and
Cure the Land, and then to Plant it with
Tobacco and Corn for their own use; and as the
Tradesmen and Merchants will trust them with
Tools, and Cloaths, and other Necessaries, upon
the Credit of their Crop before it is grown, so
they again Plant every Year a little more than the
Year before, and so buy whatever they want with
the Crop that is before them.
   HENCE Child, [$ (^says she^) ,$] many a (^Newgate^) Bird
becomes a great Man, and we have, [$ (^continued she^) ,$]
several Justices of the Peace, Officers of the
Train Bands, and Magistrates of the Towns they
live in, that have been burnt in the Hand.
   [$SHE was going on with that part of the Story,
when her own part in it interrupted her, and with
a great deal of good-humour'd Confidence she told
me, she was one of the second sort of Inhabitants
herself; that she came away openly, having
ventur'd too far in a particular Case, so that she was
become a Criminal,$] and here's the Mark of it,
CHILD, [$ (^says she^) , and pulling of her Glove,$] look
ye here, [$ (^says she^) , turning up the Palm of her
Hand, and shewed me a very fine white Arm and
Hand, but branded in the inside of the Hand, as
in such cases it must be.
   THIS Story was very moving to me, but my
Mother (smiling said,$] you need not think such a
<P 102>
thing strange, (^Daughter^) , for as I told you, some
of the best Men in this Country are burnt in the
Hand, and they are not asham'd to own it; there's
Major -- [$ (^says she^) ,$] he was an Eminent
Pick-pocket; there's Justice (^Ba--r^) was a Shoplifter,
and both of them were burnt in the Hand, and I
could name you several, such as they are.
[^MOLL AND HER MOTHER-IN-LAW CONTINUE.^]
   [$HERE my Mother-in-Law ran out in a long
account of the wicked practices in that dreadful
Place, and how it ruin'd more young People than
all the Town besides;$] and Child, [$ (^says my Mother^) ,$]
perhaps you may know little of it, or it may be
have heard nothing about it, but depend upon it,
[$ (^says she^) ,$] we all know here, that there are more
Thieves and Rogues made by that one Prison of
(^Newgate^) , than by all the Clubs and Societies of
Villains in the Nation; 'tis that cursed Place, [$ (^says
my Mother^) ,$] that half Peoples this Colony.
[^MOLL SUDDENLY REALISES THAT HER MOTHER-IN-LAW IS HER OWN MOTHER AND 
THUS MOLL'S HUSBAND IS HER BROTHER. HOWEVER MOLL PRETENDS SHE IS 
UPSET BECAUSE OF HER MOTHER'S SAD STORY.^]
<P 103>
[^---^] (^Why^) , my Dear, [$ (^says she, very kindly^) ,$] what
need these things trouble you? These Passages were
long before your time, and they give me no
trouble at all now, nay I look back on them with a
particular Satisfaction, as they have been a means
to bring me to this place? [^...^]

<S SAMPLE 7>
<P 120>
[^MOLL AND HER HUSBAND/BROTHER.^]
[^---^] [$so I answer'd him plainly, that I
could not say I was glad not to be importuned,
tho' I could not tell how to comply;$] but come,
(^my Dear^) , [$ (^said I^) ,$] what Conditions will you make
with me upon the opening this Affair to you.
   ANY Conditions in the World, [$ (^said he^) ,$] that
you can in reason desire of me; well, [$ (^said I^) ,$] come,
give it me under your Hand, that if you do not
find I am in any fault, or that I am willingly
concern'd in the Causes of the Misfortune that is
to follow, you will not blame me, use me the
worse, do me any Injury, or make me be the
Sufferer for that which is not my fault.
   THAT, [$ (^says he^) ,$] is the most reasonable demand
in the World; not to blame you for that which is
<P 121>
not your fault; give me a Pen and Ink, [$ (^says he^) ,
so I ran in and fetch'd a Pen, Ink, and Paper,
and he wrote the Condition down in the very
words I had proposed it, and sign'd it with his
Name;$] well, [$says he,$] (^what is next^) , my Dear?
   WHY, [$ (^says I^) ,$] the next is, that you will not
blame me for not discovering the Secret of it to
you before I knew it.
   VERY just again, [$ (^says he^) ,$] with all my Heart;
so he wrote down that also and sign'd it.
   WELL, (^my Dear^) , [$says I,$] then I have but one
Condition more to make with you, and that is,
that as there is no body concern'd in it but you
and I, you shall not discover it to any Person in
the World, except your own Mother; and that in
all the Measures you shall take upon the
discovery, as I am equally concern'd in it with you, (^tho'
as innocent as your self^) , you shall do nothing in a
Passion, nothing to my Prejudice, or to your
Mother's Prejudice, without my knowledge and
consent.
   [$THIS a little amaz'd him, and he wrote down
the words distinctly, but read them over and over
before he Sign'd them, hesitating at them several
times, and repeating them;$] (^my Mother's^) Prejudice!
(^and your Prejudice^) ! what mysterious thing can this
be? [$however, at last he Sign'd it.$]
   WELL, [$ (^says I^) ,$] my Dear, I'll ask you no more
under your Hand, but as you are to bear the most
unexpected and surprizing thing that perhaps ever
befel any Family in the World, I beg you to
promise me you will receive it with Composure and
a Presence of Mind suitable to a Man of Sense.
   I'LL do my utmost, [$ (^says he^) ,$] upon Condition
you will keep me no longer in suspence, for you
Terrify me with all these Preliminaries.
<P 122>
   WELL then, [$ (^says I^) ,$] it is this, as I told you
before in a Heat, that I was not your lawful
Wife, and that our Children were not legal
Children; so I must let you know now in
calmness, and in kindness, but with Affliction enough
that (^I am^) your own Sister, (^and you^) my own
Brother, and that we are both the Children of our
Mother now alive, and in the House, who is
convinc'd of the Truth of it, in a manner not to
be denied or contradicted.
   [$I SAW him turn pale, and look wild, and I
said,$] now remember your Promise, and receive it
with Presence of mind; for who cou'd have said
more to prepare you for it, than I have done?
[$However I call'd a Servant, and got him a little
Glass of Rum, which is the usual Dram of the
Country, for he was just fainting away.
   WHEN he was a little recover'd, (^I said to him^) ,$]
this Story you may be sure requires a long
Explanation, and therefore have patience and compose
your Mind to hear it out, and I'll make it as
short as I can, [$and with this, I told him what I
thought was needful of the Fact, and particularly
how my Mother came to discover it to me, as
above;$] and now my Dear, [$ (^says I^) ,$] you will see
Reason for my Capitulations, and that I neither
have been the Cause of this Matter, nor could be
so, and that I could know nothing of it before
now.
   I AM fully satisfy'd of that, [$ (^says he^) ,$] but 'tis a
dreadful Surprize to me; however, I know a
Remedy for it all, and a Remedy that shall put
an End to all your Difficulties, without your
going to (^England^) ; That would be strange, [$ (^said I^) ,$]
as all the rest; No, No, [$ (^says he^) ,$] I'll make it
easie, there's no Body in the way of it all, but
<P 123>
myself: [^---^]

[^A MIDWIFE COMES TO SEE MOLL, WHO HAS RETURNED TO ENGLAND.^]
[^---^] [$My
Landlady had told her I was very Melancholy, and
that she believ'd that had done me harm; and
once, (^before me^) , said to her,$] Mrs. B -- [$ (^meaning
the Midwife^) ,$] I believe this Lady's Trouble is of a
kind that is pretty much in your way, and
therefore if you can do any thing for her, pray do,
for she is a very civil Gentlewoman, [$and so she
went out of the Room.
   I REALLY did not understand her, but my
Mother Midnight began very seriously to explain
what she meant, as soon as she was gone:$]
Madam, [$ (^says she^) ,$] you seem not to understand what
your Landlady means, and when you do
understand it, you need not let her know at all that
you do so.
<P 197>
   SHE means that you are under some
Circumstances that may render your Lying-Inn difficult
to you, and that you are not willing to be
expos'd; I need say no more, but to tell you, that
if you think fit to communicate so much of your
Case to me, (^if it be so^) , as is necessary; for I do
not desire to pry into those things, I perhaps may
be in a Condition to assist you, and to make you
perfectly easie, and remove all your dull Thoughts
upon that Subject.
[^MOLL TELLS PART OF HER STORY TO THE MIDWIFE.^]
   [$SHE took me short, (^and told me^) , that was none
of her Business, all the Ladies that came under
her Care were married Women to her;$] every
Woman, [$ (^says she^) ,$] that is with Child has a Father for
it, [$and whether that Father was a Husband or
no Husband, was no Business of hers; her
Business was to assist me in my present Circumstances,
whether I had a Husband or no;$] for, (^Madam^) , [$ (^says
she^) ,$] to have a Husband that cannot appear, is to
<P 198>
have no Husband in the sense of the Case, and
therefore whether you are a Wife or a Mistress is
all one to me.
   [$I FOUND presently, that whether I was a
Whore or a Wife, I was to pass for a Whore here,
so I let that go; (^I told her^) , it was true as she said,
but that however, if I must tell her my Case, I
must tell it her as it was: So I related it to her as
short as I could, and I concluded it to her thus,$] (^I
trouble you with all this^) , Madam, [$said I,$] (^not that,
as you said before, it is much to the purpose^) in your
Affair, but this is to the purpose, (^namely, that I
am not in any pain about being seen, or being publick
or conceal'd, for 'tis perfectly indifferent to me; but
my difficulty is, that I have no Acquaintance in this
part of the Nation^) .
   I UNDERSTAND you, Madam, [$ (^says she^) ,$] you
have no Security to bring to prevent the Parish
Impertinences usual in such Cases; and perhaps,
[$ (^says she^) ,$] do not know very well how to dispose of the
Child when it comes; the last, [$ (^says I^) ,$] is not so
much my concern as the first: Well, Madam,
[$ (^answers the Midwife^) ,$] dare you put your self into my
Hands, I live in such a place, tho' I do not
enquire after you, you may enquire after me, my
Name is B-- I live in such a Street, [$naming the
Street,$] at the Sign of the (^Cradle^) , my Profession
is a Midwife, and I have many Ladies that come
to my House to Lye-Inn; I have given Security
to the Parish in General Terms to secure them
from any Charge, from whatsoever shall come
into the World under my Roof; I have but one
Question to ask in the whole Affair, Madam, [$ (^says
she^) ,$] and if that be answer'd, you shall be entirely
easie for all the rest.
<P 199>
   [$I presently understood what she meant, and 
told her,$] Madam, (^I believe I understand you^) ; I thank
God, (^tho' I want Friends in this Part of the World,
I do not want Money, so far as may be Necessary,
tho' I do not abound in that neither^) : [$This I added,
because I would not make her expect great things;$]
well Madam, [$ (^says she^) ,$] that is the thing indeed,
without which nothing can be done in
these Cases; and yet, [$ (^says she^) ,$] you shall see that
I will not impose upon you, or offer any thing
that is unkind to you, and if you desire it, you
shall know every thing before hand, that you
may suit your self to the Occasion, and be either
costly or sparing as you see fit.
[^MOLL RECEIVES A BILL OF FARE FOR THE MIDWIFE'S SERVICES.^]

I saw them: (^I told her^) , I was sorry to tell her
that I fear'd I must be her lowest rated Customer,

Welcome upon that Account^) . No not at all, [$ (^said she^) ,$]
for where I have One of the third Sort, I have
Two of the Second, and Four to One of the First,

any; but if you doubt my Care of you, I will
allow any Friend you have to overlook, and see if
you are well waited on, or no.
   [$THEN she explain'd the particulars of her
Bill;$] in the first Place, Madam, [$ (^said she^) ,$] I would
have you Observe, that here is three Months
Keeping, you are but 10 (^s.^) a Week, I undertake
to say you will not complain of my Table: I
suppose, [$ (^says she^) ,$] you do not live Cheaper where
you are now; no indeed, [$ (^said I^) ,$] nor so Cheap,
for I give six Shillings (^per^) Week for my Chamber,
and find my own Diet as well as I can, which costs
me a great deal more.
<P 202>
   THEN Madam, [$ (^says she^) ,$] If the Child should not
live, or should be dead Born, as you know sometime
happens, then there is the Minister's Article
saved; and if you have no Friends to come to you,
you may save the Expence of a Supper; so that
take those Articles out Madam, [$ (^says she^) ,$] your
Lying-In will not cost you above 5 (^l.^) 3 (^s.^) in all,
more than your ordinary Charge of Living.
[^MOLL AGREES TO THE TERMS, AND HOPES THE "WOMAN OF THE HOUSE" WILL 
NOT THINK BADLY OF HER.^]
<P 203>
   O DEAR, [$ (^said she^) ,$] her Ladyship is no stranger
to these things; she has try'd to entertain Ladies
in your Condition several times, but could not
secure the Parish; and besides, she is not
such a nice Lady as you take her to be; however,
since you are agoing you shall not meddle with
her, but I'll see you are a little better look'd
after while you are here, than I think you are,
and it shall not cost you the more neither.

[^MOLL SPEAKS TO HER "GOVERNESS", WHOM SHE CALLS MOTHER.^]
[^...^] [$I told her I
own'd she had.$] Well my Dear, [$ (^says she^) ,$] and when
you are gone, what are you to me? and what
would it be to me if you were to be Hang'd?
Do you think there are not Women, who as it is
their Trade, and they get their Bread by it,
<P 213>
value themselves upon their being as careful of
Children, as their own Mothers can be, and
understand it rather better? Yes, yes, Child, [$ (^says
she^) ,$] fear it not, How were we Nurs'd ourselves?
Are you sure, you was Nurs'd up by your own
Mother? and yet you look fat, and fair Child, [$says
the old Beldam, and with that she stroak'd me
over the Face;$] never be concern'd Child, [$ (^says she^) ,
going on in her drolling way;$] I have no
Murtherers about me, I employ the best, and the
honestest Nurses that can be had; and have as few
Children miscarry under their Hands, as there would,
if they were all Nurs'd by Mothers; we want
neither Care or Skill.
[^MOLL AND HER GOVERNESS CONTINUE.^]
   IT may be true Mother, [$ (^says I^) ,$] for ought I
know, but my Doubts are very strongly
<P 214>
grounded, indeed; come then, [$ (^says she^) ,$] lets hear some of
them: Why first, [$ (^says I^) ,$] you give a Piece of
Money to these People to take the Child off the
Parents Hands, and to take Care of it as long as
it lives; now we know Mother, [$ (^said I^) ,$] that those
are poor People, and their Gain consists in being
quit of the Charge as soon as they can; how can
I doubt but that, as it is best for them to have
the Child die, they are not over Solicitous about
its Life.
   THIS is all Vapours and Fancy, [$ (^says the old
Woman^) ,$] I tell you their Credit depends upon the
Child's Life, and they are as careful as any
Mother of you all.
   O Mother, [$ (^says I^) ,$] if I was but sure my little
Baby would be carefully look'd to, and have Justice
done it, I should be happy indeed; but it is
impossible I can be satisfy'd in that Point, unless I
saw it, and to see it, would be Ruin and
Destruction to me, as now my Case stands, so what
to do I know not.
   A FINE Story! [$ (^says the Governess^) ,$] you would
see the Child, and you would not see the Child;
you would be Conceal'd and Discover'd both
together; these are things impossible my Dear, so
you must e'n do as other conscientious Mothers have
done before you; and be contented with things
as they must be, tho' they are not as you wish
them to be.
[^MOLL AND THE GOVERNESS CONTINUE.^]
<P 215>
   [$AT last my old Governness came to me, with
her usual Assurance.$] Come my Dear, [$ (^says she^) ,$] I
have found out a way how you shall be at a
certainty, that your Child shall be used well, and
yet the People that take Care of it shall never
know you, or who the Mother of the Child is.
   O Mother, [$ (^says I^) [^SOURCE TEXT HAS she FOR I^] ,$]         #
If you can do so, you will
engage me to you for ever: Well, [$ (^says she^) ,$] are
you willing to be at some small Annual Expence,
more than what we usually give to the People we
Contract with? Ay, [$ (^says I^) ,$] with all my Heart,
provided I may be conceal'd; as to that, [$says (^the
Governness^) ,$] you shall be Secure? for the Nurse
shall never so much as dare to Enquire about
you, and you shall once or twice a Year go with
me and see your Child, and see how 'tis used, and
be satisfy'd that it is in good Hands, no Body
knowing who you are.
   WHY, [$ (^said I^) ,$] do you think Mother, that when
I come to see my Child, I shall be able to conceal
my being the Mother of it, do you think that
possible?
   WELL, well, [$ (^says my Governness^) ,$] if you
discover it, the Nurse shall be never the wiser; for
she shall be forbid to ask any Questions about
you, or to take any Notice; if she offers it she
shall lose the Money which you are to be suppos'd
to give her, and the Child be taken from her too.

Tankard, which he had fetch'd from another Box by
Mistake; or else it must be, that the Rogue forgot
that he had not brought it in, which certainly
he had not.

   I FOUND the next Day she was wonderful
inquisitive about this Gentleman; the description I

(^Hampstead^) to Visit a Gentleman of his Acquaintance,
and as he came back again he was set upon and
Robb'd; and having got a little Drink too, as
they suppose, the Rogues abus'd him, and he is
very ill: Robb'd, [$ (^says my Governess^) ,$] and what did
they take from him; why, [$ (^says her Friend^) ,$] they
<P 282>
took his Gold Watch, and his Gold Snuff-box,
his fine Perriwig, and what Money he had in his
Pocket, which was considerable to be sure, for
Sir -- never goes without a Purse of Guineas
about him.
   PSHAW! [$says my old Governess jeering,$] I
warrant you he has got drunk now and got a
Whore, and she has pick'd his Pocket, and so he
comes home to his Wife and tells her he has been
Robb'd; that's an old sham, a thousand such tricks
are put upon the poor Women every Day.
   FYE, [$ (^says her Friend^) ,$] I find you don't know
Sir --, why he is as Civil a Gentleman, there
is not a finer Man, nor a soberer grave modester
Person in the whole City; he abhors such things,
there's no Body that knows him will think such a
thing of him: Well, well, [$ (^says my Governess^) ,$] that's
none of my Business, if it was, I warrant I should
find there was something of that kind in it; your
Modest Men in common Opinion are sometimes
no better than other People, only they keep a
better Character, or if you please, are the better
Hypocrites.
   No, no, [$ (^says her Friend^) ,$] I can assure you Sir
-- is no Hypocrite, he is really an honest sober
Gentleman, and he has certainly been Robb'd:
Nay, [$ (^says my Governess^) ,$] it may be he has, it is no
Business of mine I tell you; I only want to speak
with him, my Business is of another Nature; but,
[$ (^says her Friend^) ,$] let your Business be of what
nature it will, you cannot see him yet, for he is not
fit to be seen, for he is very ill, and bruis'd very
much: Ay, [$ (^says my Governess^) ,$] nay then he has
fallen into bad Hands to be sure; [$and then she
ask'd gravely,$] pray where is he bruised? Why in
his Head, [$ (^said her Friend^) ,$] and one of his Hands,
<P 283>
and his Face, for they us'd him barbarously. Poor
Gentleman, [$ (^says my Governess^) ,$] I must wait then
till he recovers, [$and adds,$] I hope it will not be
long, for I want very much to speak with him.

D--l you have done to him; why you have
almost kill'd him: [$I look'd at her with disorder
enough;$] I kill'd him! [$ (^says I^) ,$] you must mistake the
Person, I am sure I did nothing to him, he was
very well when I left him, [$ (^said I^) ,$] only drunk and
fast asleep; I know nothing of that, [$ (^says she^) ,$] but
he is in a sad pickle now, [$and so she told me all
that her Friend had said to her:$] Well then, [$ (^says

Sir, I should say, [$ (^says she^) ;$] be not surpris'd, Sir,
[$ (^says she^) ,$] that I am able to tell you every step you
took that Day from the (^Cloyster^) in (^Smithfield^) , to
<P 285>
the (^Spring-Garden^) at (^Knightsbridge^) , and thence to
the -- in the (^Strand^) , and how you were left
asleep in the Coach afterwards; I say let not this
surprize you, for Sir I do not come to make a
Booty of you, I ask nothing of you, and I assure
you the Woman that was with you knows nothing
who you are, and never shall; and yet perhaps I
may serve you farther still, for I did not come
barely to let you know, that I was inform'd of
these things, as if I wanted a Bribe to conceal
them; assure your self, Sir, [$ (^said she^) ,$] that whatever
you think fit to do or say to me, it shall be all a
secret as it is, as much as if I were in my Grave.
   [$HE was astonish'd at her Discourse, and said
gravely to her,$] Madam, you are a Stranger to me,
but it is very unfortunate, that you should be let
into the Secret of the worst action of my Life,
and a thing that I am so justly asham'd of, that the
only satisfaction of it to me was, that I thought
it was known only to God and my own
Conscience: Pray, Sir, [$ (^says she^) ,$] do not reckon the
Discovery of it to me, to be any part of your
Misfortune; it was a thing, I believe, you were
surprised into, and perhaps the Woman us'd some
Art to prompt you to it; however, you will
never find any just Cause, [$ (^said she^) ,$] to repent that I
came to hear of it; nor can your own Mouth be
more silent in it than I have been, and ever
shall be.
   WELL, [$ (^says he^) ,$] but let me do some Justice to
the Woman too, whoever she is, I do assure you
she prompted me to nothing, she rather declin'd
me, it was my own Folly and Madness that
brought me into it all, ay and brought her into it
too; I must give her her due so far, as to what
she took from me, I cou'd expect no less from her
<P 286>
in the condition I was in, and to this Hour I know
not whether she Robb'd me or the Coachman; if
she did it I forgive her, and I think all
Gentlemen that do so, should be us'd in the same manner;
but I am more concern'd for some other things
than I am for all that she took from me.
   [$MY Governess now began to come into the
whole matter, and he open'd himself freely to her;
first, she said to him, in answer to what he had
said about me,$] I am glad Sir you are so just to the
Person that you were with; I assure you she is a
Gentlewoman, and no Woman of the Town; and
however you prevail'd with her so far as you did,
I am sure 'tis not her Practise; you run a great
venture indeed, Sir, but if that be any part of
your Care, I am perswaded you may be perfectly
easie, for I dare assure you no Man has touch'd her,
before you, since her Husband, and he has been
dead now almost eight Year.
   [$IT appear'd that this was his Grievance, and
that he was in a very great fright about it;
however, when my Governess said this to him he
appeared very well pleased; and said,$] well, Madam, to
be plain with you, if I was satisfy'd of that, I
should not so much value what I lost; for as to
that, the Temptation was great, and perhaps she
was poor and wanted it: If she had not been poor
Sir --, [$ (^says my Governess^) ,$] I assure you she would
never have yielded to you, and as her Poverty
first prevailed with her to let you do as you did,
so the same Poverty prevail'd with her to pay her
self at last, when she saw you was in such a
Condition, that if she had not done it, perhaps the next
Coach-man or Chair-man might have done it.
   WELL, [$ (^says he^) ,$] much good may it do her; I say
again, all the Gentlemen that do so, ought to be
<P 287>
us'd in the same manner, and then they would be
cautious of themselves; I have no more concern
about it, but on the score which you hinted at before,
Madam: [^---^]

<S SAMPLE 13>
<P 298>
[^MOLL IS ACCUSED OF STEALING IN A SHOP, AND DETAINED BY THE 
SHOPKEEPER.^]
[^---^] [$the Porter said he
would serve me with all his Heart;$] but, Madam,
[$ (^says he^) ,$] let me hear them refuse to let you go, then
I may be able to speak the plainer.
   [$WITH that I spoke aloud to the Master of the
Shop, and said,$] Sir, you know in your own
Conscience that I am not the Person you look for, and
that I was not in your Shop before, therefore I
demand that you detain me here no longer, or tell
me the reason of your stopping me; [$the Fellow
grew surlier upon this than before, and said he
would do neither till he thought fit;$] very well,
[$said I to the Constable and to the Porter,$] you will
be pleas'd to remember this, Gentlemen, another
time; [$the Porter said,$] (^yes Madam^) , [$and the
Constable began not to like it, and would have
perswaded the Mercer to dismiss him, and let me go,
since, as he said, he own'd I was not the Person;$]
Good Sir, [$ (^says the Mercer to him Tauntingly^) ,$]
are you a Justice of Peace, or a Constable? I
charg'd you with her, pray do you do your Duty:
[$The Constable told him a little mov'd, but very
handsomely,$] (^I know my Duty, and what I am, Sir,
I doubt you hardly know what you are doing^) ; [$they
had some other hard words, and in the mean time
the Journey-men, impudent and unmanly to the
last degree, used me barbarously, and one of them,
the same that first seized upon me, pretended he
would search me, and began to lay Hands on me:
I spit in his Face, call'd out to the Constable, and
bad him take notice of my usage;$] and pray, Mr.
Constable, [$ (^said I^) ,$] ask that Villain's Name,
[$pointing to the Man; the Constable reprov'd him
decently, told him that he did not know what he
<P 299>
did, for he knew that his Master acknowledg'd I
was not the Person that was in his Shop; and,
says the Constable,$] I am afraid your Master is
bringing himself and me too into Trouble, if this
Gentlewoman comes to prove who she is, and where
she was, and it appears that she is not the Woman
you pretend to; Dam her, [$ (^says the Fellow again^) ,
with an impudent harden'd Face,$] she is the Lady
you may depend upon it, I'll swear she is the same
Body that was in the Shop, and that I gave the
pieces of Satin that is lost into her own hand, you
shall hear more of it when Mr. (^William^) and
(^Anthony, those were other Journeymen^) , come back, they
will know her again as well as I.
   [$JUST as the insolent Rogue was talking
thus to the Constable, comes back Mr. (^William^) and
Mr. (^Anthony^) , as he call'd them, and a great
Rabble with them, bringing along with them the true
Widow that I was pretended to be; and they came
sweating and blowing into the Shop, and with a
great deal of Triumph dragging the poor Creature
in a most butcherly manner up towards their
Master, who was in the back Shop, and cryed out aloud,$]
here's the Widow, Sir, we have catch'd her at last;
what do ye mean by that, [$ (^says the Master^) ,$] why
we have her already, there she sits, [$ (^says he^) ,$] and
Mr. -- [$ (^says he^) ,$] can swear this is she: [$The
other Man who they call'd Mr. (^Anthony^) replyed,$]
Mr. -- may say what he will, and swear what
he will, but this is the Woman, and there's the
Remnant of Sattin she stole, I took it out of her
Cloaths with my own Hand.
   [$I SAT still now, and began to take a better
Heart, but smil'd and said nothing; the Master
look'd Pale; the Constable turn'd about and
look'd at me;$] (^let 'em alone Mr. Constable^) , [$said I,$]
<P 300>
(^let 'em go on^) ; [$the Case was plain and could not be
denied, so the Constable was charg'd with the
right Thief, and the Mercer told me very civily
he was sorry for the mistake, and hoped I would
not take it ill; that they had so many things of
this nature put upon them every Day, that they
cou'd not be blam'd for being very sharp in doing
themselves Justice:$] Not take it ill, Sir! [$ (^said I^) ,$]
how can I take it well? if you had dismiss'd me
when your insolent Fellow seiz'd on me in the
Street, and brought me to you; and when you
your self acknowledg'd I was not the Person, I
would have put it by, and not taken it ill, because
of the many ill things I believe you have put
upon you daily; but your Treatment of me since has
been unsufferable, and especially that of your
Servant, I must and will have Reparation for that.
[^MOLL RELATES THE STORY FROM THE SHOP TO HER GOVERNESS.^]
<P 305>
   [$AFTER this hustle, coming home, and telling
my Governess the Story, she falls a Laughing at
me;$] Why are you merry, [$ (^says I^) ?$] the Story has
not so much Laughing room in it, as you imagine;
I am sure I have had a great deal of Hurry and
Fright too, with a Pack of ugly Rogues. (^Laugh^) ,
[$says my Governess,$] I laugh Child to see what a
lucky Creature you are; why this Jobb will be
the best Bargain to you, that ever you made in
your Life, if you manage it well: I warrant you,
[$ (^says she^) ,$] you shall make the (^Mercer^) pay you 500 (^l.^)
for Damages, besides what you shall get of the
Journeyman.

[^MOLL SEES HER LANCASHIRE-HUSBAND WHO IS ALSO IN PRISON FOR 
ROBBERY.^]
   [$AS soon as he was gone, and I had shut the
Door, I threw off my Hood, and bursting out into
Tears,$] (^my Dear^) , [$says I,$] (^do you not know me^) ? [$He
turn'd pale and stood Speechless, like one
Thunder struck, and not able to conquer the Surprize,
said no more but this,$] (^let me sit down^) ; [^---^]
[^MOLL AND HER LANCASHIRE HUSBAND CONTINUE.^]
<P 366>
[^---^] [$but after I
had given some vent to my Passion by Tears, I
repeated the same Words:$] MY DEAR, (^do you not
know me^) ? [$at which he answer'd$] YES, [$and said no
more a good while.
   AFTER some time continuing in the Surprize,
(^as above^) , he cast up his Eyes towards me and said,$]
(^How could you be so cruel^) ? [$I did not readily
understand what he meant; and I answer'd,$] How
can you call me Cruel? What have I been Cruel
to you in? (^To come to me^) , [$says he,$] (^in such a Place
as this, is it not to insult me? I have not robb'd^)
you? (^at least not on^) the Highway?
   [$I PERCEIV'D by this, that he knew nothing of
the miserable Circumstances I was in, and thought
that having got some Intelligence of his being
there, I had come to upbraid him with his
leaving me; but I had too much to say to him to
be affronted, and told him in few Words, that I
was far from coming to Insult him, but at best
I came to Condole mutually, that he would be
easily satisfy'd, that I had no such View, when I
should tell him that (^my Condition was worse than
his, and that many ways^) : He look'd a little
concern'd at the general Expression of my Condition
being worse than his; but with a kind of a smile,
look'd a little wildly, and said,$] How can that be?
when you see me Feter'd, and in (^Newgate^) , and
two of my Companions Executed already; can
you say your Condition is worse than Mine?
   COME my Dear, [$ (^says I^) ,$] we have a long peice
of Work to do, if I should be to relate, or you
to hear my unfortunate History; but if you are
dispos'd to hear it, you will soon conclude with
me that my Condition is worse than yours: How
is that possible, [$ (^says he again^) ,$] when I expect to be
<P 367>
cast for my Life the very next Sessions? Yes [$ (^says
I^) ,$] 'tis very possible when I shall tell you that I
have been cast for my Life three Sessions ago, and
am under Sentence of Death, is not my Case
worse than yours?
   [$THEN indeed he stood silent again, like one
struck Dumb, and after a little while he starts up,$]
unhappy Couple! [$ (^says he^) ,$] How can this be
possible? [$I took him by the Hand,$] come MY DEAR,
[$ (^said I^) ,$] sit down, and let us compare our Sorrows:
I am a Prisoner in this very House, and in a
much worse Circumstance than you, and you will
be satisfy'd I do not come to Insult you, when I
tell you the particulars; [^---^]
[^MOLL TELLS HER STORY TO HER LANCASHIRE HUSBAND.^]

[^---^] [$but when I 
came to the Story of little (^Brickill^) , he was
surpriz'd,$] (^and was it you my Dear^) , [$said he,$] (^that gave
the Check to the Mob that was at our Heels there^) , at
(^Brickill^) : Yes [$ (^said I^) ,$] it was I indeed, [$and then
I told him the particulars which I had observ'd
of him there.$] (^Why then^) , [$said he,$] (^it was you that
sav'd my Life at that time^) , and I am glad I owe my
Life to you, for I will pay the Debt to you now,
and I'll deliver you from the present Condition
you are in, or I will die in the attempt.
   [$I TOLD him by no means; it was a Risque too
great, not worth his running the hazard of, and for
a Life not worth his saving;$] 'twas no matter for
that [$he said, it was a Life worth all the World to
him; a Life that had given him a new Life;$] for
