More like a brute Beast, then a Gentleman.

Thy body worthy borne, and thy youths brest
Tyld in due time for better discipline.

We wil both comfort him, and counsel him. [$ (^ (\Exeunt\) ^) $]
[$ (^A noyse within, crying, Follow, follow, follow: Then enter      #
Butler, 
Thomas and Iohn Scarborrow with money bagges.^) $] 
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] What shal we do now Butler?
   [$ (^But.^) $] A man had better lyne a good handsome payre of     #
gallows
before his time, then be born to do these sucklings good, their
mothers milke not wrung out of their nose yet, they knowe no more
how to behaue themselues in this honest and needeful calling of
Purse-taking, then I do to peece stockings.
   [$ (^within.^) $] This way, This way, this way.
   [$ (^Both.^) $] Sfut what shal we do now?
   [$ (^But.^) $] See if they do not quake like a                    #
trembling-Asp-leafe, and
look more miserable then one of the wicked Elders picturd in the
painted cloth, should they but come to the credit to be arraind for
their valor, before a worshipfull bench, their very lookes woulde
hang em, and they were indighted but for stealing of Egs.
   [$ (^within.^) $] Follow, follow, this way follow.
   [$ (^Tho:^) $] Butler.   [$ (^Iohn.^) $] Honest Butler.

[^CATCHWORD and OMITTED HERE IN SOURCE TEXT^] lye me as close to the #
ground as you would do to a wench.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] How good Butler, show vs how.
   [$ (^But.^) $] By the Moone patronesse of all purse-takers, who   #
woulde
be troubled with such Changelings, squat hart squat.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] Thus Butler.
   [$ (^But.^) $] I so suckling, so, sturre not nowe, If the peering #
Rogues
chance to goe ouer you, yet sturre not younger Brothers call you
em, and haue no more forecast, I am ashamd of you, these are such
whose fathers had neede leaue them money, euen to make them
ready withall, for by this hiltes, they haue not wit to butten theyr
sleeues without teaching, close, squat close. Now if the lot of
hanging do fall to my share, so, then the Fathers old man drops for  #
his
young maisters. If it chance it chances, and when it chaunces, 
heauen and the Sheriffe send me a good rope, I wold not go vp the
lather twice for any thing, in the meane time preuentions            #
[^SOURCE TEXT: preuentious^] , honest
preuentions do well, off with my skin, so you on the ground, and
I to this tree to escape the Gallows.
   [$ (^With.^) $] Follow, follow, follow.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Do follow, if I do not deceiue you, Ile bid a poxe #
of this
wit, and hang with a good grace.

   [$2$]  Sirrah, sir, what make you in that tree.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Gathring of Nuts, that such fools as you are may   #
cracke the 
shels, and I eat the kernels.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] What fellowes that?
   [$ (^But.^) $] Sir Iohn Harcop, my Noble Knight, I am gladde of   #
your
good health, you beare your Age faier, you keep a good house, I
ha fed at your boord, and bin drunke in your buttery.
<P F3R>
   [$ (^Har.^) $] But sirha: what made you in that tree?
My man and I at foot of yonder hill
Were by three knaues robd of three hundred pound.
   [$ (^But.^) $] A shrewd losse berlady sir, but your good worship  #
may
now see the fruit of being miserable: You will ride but with one
man to saue hors-meat and mans meat at your Inne at night, &
lose three hundred pound in a morning.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Sirha, I say I ha lost three hundred pound.
   [$ (^But.^) $] And I say sir, I wish all miserable knights might  #
bee
serued so: For had you kept halfe a dozen tall fellowes, as a man of
your coat should do, they woulde haue helpt now to keep your 
money.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] But tell me sir, why lurkt you in that tree?
   [$ (^But.^) $] Mary, I will tell you sir, Comming to the top of   #
the hill
where you (Right worshipfull) wer robd at the bottome, &
seeing some a scuffling together, my mind strait gaue me ther were
knaues abroad. Now sir, I knowing my selfe to be olde, tough,
and vnwieldy, not being able to doe as I would, as muche as to
say, Rescue you (right Worshipfull,) I like an honest man, one
of the Kings liege people, and a good subiect
   [$ (^Ser.^) $] A sayes well Sir.
Got me vp to the top of that tree: The tree (if it could speake)
would beare me witnesse, that there I might see which way the
knaues tooke, then to tell you of it, and you right worshipfullie
to send hue to cry after em.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Was it so.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Nay twas so sir.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] Nay then I tell thee they tooke into this wood.
   [$ (^But.^) $] And I tell thee (setting thy worsh. knighthood     #
aside)
he lyes in his throat that saies so: Had not one of them a white
Frocke? Did they not bind your worships knighthoode by the
thumbs? then fagoted you and the fool your man, back to back.
   [$ (^Man.^) $] He sayes true.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Why then so truly, came not they into this wood, but
tooke ouer the Lawnes, & left Winno steeple on the left hand.
   [$ (^Har.^) $] It may be so, by this they are out of reach,
Well, farewell it.
   [$ (^But,^) $] Ride with more men, good knight.
<P F3V>
   [$ (^Har.^) $] It shall teach me wit. [$ (^Exit Har. with         #
followers.^) $]

Schollers
Prize, let me be hist at. Now to the next. Come out you
Hedghogs? [$ (^Tho.^) $] O Butler, thou deserust to be chronicled    #
for this.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Do not bely me, If I had my right I deserue to be
hanged fort. But come, Downe with your dust, our mornings
purchase. [$ (^Tho.^) $] Heer tis, Thou hast playd well, Thou
deserust two shares in it.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Three hundred pound: A pretty breakfast: Many a ma~
workes harde all his daies and neuer sees halfe the money. But
come, Tho it be badly got, it shalbe better bestowd. But do ye
heare Galants, I ha not taught you this trade to get your liuings
by. Vse it not, for if you doe, though I scapt by the Nut tree, be
sure youle speed by the Rope: But for your paynes at this tyme,
Theres a hundred pounds for you, how you shall bestow it, Ile
giue you instructions. But do you heare, Looke you goe not to
your Gilles, your Punkes, and your Cock-tricks with it, If I hear
you do: as I am an honest theefe, tho I helpt you now out of the
Bryers, Ile be a meanes yet to helpe you to the Gallowes. How
the rest shall be employd I haue determined, and by the way Ile
make you acquainted with it.

at his funerall.
   [$ (^Bart.^) $] And how dost feel thy selfe Franke, now thy       #
father is

my selfe else? But Ile tell you newes Gallants.
   [$ (^went.^) $] Whats that? Dost meane now to serue God?
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Faith partly, for I intend shortly to goe to       #
Church, and
from thence do faithfull seruice to one woman.
<P F4R>
[$ (^Enter Butler.^) $]
   [$ (^But.^) $] Good, I ha met my flesh-hooks together.
   [$ (^Bart.^) $] What, Dost meane to be marryed?
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] I Mungrell, Marryed.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Thats a bayt for me.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] I will now be honestly marryed.
   [$ (^went.^) $] Its impossible, for thou hast bin a whoremayster  #
this
seauen yeare.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Tis no matter, I will now marry, And to som honest
woman to, and so from hence her vertues shall be a countenance to
my vices. [$ (^Bart.^) $] What shall she be, prethee?
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] No Lady, no widdow, nor no waiting gentlewoman, for
vnder protection
Ladyes may larde their husbands heads, Widdows will
Woodcocks make, & chambermayds of serui~gme~ learn that, theyle ner
forsake. [$ (^Went.^) $] Who wilt thou wed then, prethe?
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] To any mayd, so she be fayr: To any mayd, so she   #
be rich
To any mayd so she be young: and to any mayde
   [$ (^Bart.^) $] So she be honest.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Faith, its no great matter for her honestye, for   #
in these
dayes, thats a Dowrie out of request.
   [$ (^But.^) $] From these Crabes will I gather sweetnesse: wherin #
Ile
imitate the Bee, that sucks her hony, not from the sweetest
flowers, but Timb the bitterest: So these hauing beene the meanes to
begger my mayster, shalbe the helpes to releeue his brothers and
sister.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] To whom shall I now be a suter?

   [$ (^went.^) $] I, but not willingly Cuckolds, tho we are now     #
talking
about wiues.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Let your wiues agree of that after, will you first #
be
richly married? [$ (^All.^) $] How Butler: richly married?
   [$ (^But.^) $] Rich in beauty, rich in purse, riche in vertue,    #
riche in all
things. But (^Mum^) , Ile say nothing, I know of two or three rich
heyres. But (^Cargo^) , my fiddlestick cannot play without Rozen:    #
Auant.
   [$ (^went.^) $] Butler.  
<P F4V>
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Dost not know me Butler?
   [$ (^But.^) $] For Kex, dryde Kex, that in summer ha bin so       # 
liberal to
fodder other mens cattle, and scarce haue inough to keepe your
owne in Winter. Mine are precious Cabinets, and must haue
pretious Iewels put into them, and I know you to be                  #
[^SOURCE TEXT: he^] merchants
of Stockfish, and not men for my market: Then vanish.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Come, ye old mad-cap you, what need all this? Cannot
a man ha bin a little whoore-mayster in his youth, but you must
vpbraide him with it, and tell him of his defects, which when he
is maried, his wife shall finde in him? Why my fathers dead man
now, who by his death has left me the better part of a thousand
a yeare.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Tut, she of Lancashire has fifteen hundred.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Let me haue her then, good Butler.
   [$ (^But.^) $] And then shee the bright beauty of Leystershire,   #
has a
thousand, nay thirteen hundred a yeare, at least.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Or let me haue her, honest Butler.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Besides, she the most delicate, sweet countenanst, #
blacke
browd gentlewoman in Northamptonshire, in substance equals
the best of em.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Let me haue her then.
   [$ (^Bart.^) $] Or I.
   [$ (^Went.^) $] Or I, good Butler.
   [$ (^But.^) $] You were best play the partes of right fooles, and #
most
despera~te whore-maysters, and go together by the eares for the~
ere ye see them. But they are the moste rare featurd, well faced,
excellent spoke, rare qualited, vertuous, and worthy to be
admired gentlewoman,
   [$ (^All.^) $] And rich Butler?
   [$ (^But.^) $] (I that must be one, tho they want all the rest)   #
And rich
Gallants, as are from the vtmost parts of (^Asya^) , to these present
confines of Europe.
   [$ (^All^) $] And wilt thou helpe vs to them Butler?
   [$ (^But.^) $] Faith, tis to be doubted, for pretious pearle will #
hardly
be bought without pretious [^SOURCE TEXT: ptetious^] stones, and I   #
think theres scarse one
indifferent one to be found, betwixt you three: yet since there is
some hope ye may proue honest, as by the death of your fathers
<P G1R>
Fathers you [^CATCHWORD IS you; THUS Fathers MUST BE ERRONEOUS       #
REPETITION^] are proued rich, walke seuerally, for I knowing you
all three to be couetous Tug-muttons will not trust you with the
sight of each others beawty but will seuerally, talke with you, and
since you haue deignd in this needfull portion of wedlocke to bee
ruld by mee Butler, will most bountifully prouide wiues for you
generally.
   [$ (^All.^) $] Why that honestly said.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Why so, and now first to your Sir Knight
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Godamercy.
   [$ (^But.^) $] You see this couple of abhominable Woodcocks heare.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] A pox on them, absolute Coxcomes.
   [$ (^But.^) $] You heard me tel them, I had Intelligence to giue  #
of three
Gentlewomen.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] True.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Now indeed Sir [^SOURCE TEXT: Sit^] I ha but the   #
performance of one.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Good.
   [$ (^But.^) $] And her I doe intende for you, onely for you.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Honest Butler.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Now sir, shee being but lately come to this towne, #
and so
neerely watcht by the iealous eyes of her friends, she being a Rich
heyre, least she should be stolne away by some disolute Prodigal,
or desperat estated spend-thrift, as you ha bin Sir.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] O but thats past Butler.
   [$ (^But.^) $] True I knowt, & intend now but to make vse of them, 
flatter with them with hopefull promises, and make them needefull
instruments.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] To helpe me to the wench,
   [$ (^But^) $] You ha hit it which thus must be effected           #
[^SOURCE TEXT: beeffected^] , first by keeping
close your purpose.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Good.
   [$ (^Ba.^) $] Also concealing from them, the lodging beauty and   #
riches
of your new, but admirable Mistris.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Excellent.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Of which your following happines, if they should   #
know
either in enuy of your good, or hope of their owne aduancement
theyd make our labours knowne to the gentlewomans Vncles, and
so our benefit be frustrate.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Admirable Butler.
<P G1V>
   [$ (^But.^) $] Which done, als but this, being as you shal be     #
brought
into hir company, and by my [^SOURCE TEXT: bymy^] praising your      #
vertues you get
possession of her Loue, one morning step to the tower, or to make al #
sure,
hier some stipendary prieste for money: for Money in these
dayes, what wil not be done, and what will not a man do for a rich
wife, and with him make no more ado but marrie hir in hir lodging
and being married, lie with her and spare not.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Do they not see vs, do they not see vs, let mee    #
kisse thee, let
me kisse thee Butler, let but this be done, and all the benefit 
requitall and happines I can promise thee fort, shall be this, Ile   #
be thy
rich maister, and thou shalt carry my purse.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Enough, meet me at her lodging some half an houre  #
hence:
harke she lies.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] I hate.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Faile not.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Will I liue.
   [$ (^But.^) $] I wil but shift of these two Rhinoceros,
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Wigens, wingens, a couple of guls.
   [$ (^But.^) $] With some discourse of hope to wiue them two, and be
with you straight.
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Blest day, my loue shal be thy cushion honest      #
Butler.
   [$ (^But.^) $] So now to my tother Gallants.
   [$ (^Went.^) $] O Butler, we ha bin in passion at thy tediousnes,
   [$ (^But.^) $] Why looke you. I had al this talke for your good.
   [$ (^Bar.^) $] Hadst.
   [$ (^But.^) $] For you know the knight is but a 
scuruy-proud-prating-Prodigall, licentious vnnecessary.
   [$ (^Went.^) $] An Asse, an Asse, an Asse.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Now you heard me tel him I had three Wenches in    #
store,
   [$ (^Bar.^) $] And he would ha had them al would he.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Heare me, tho he may liue to be an Oxe, he had not #
now
so much of the Goat in him, but onely hopes for one of the three
when indeed I ha but two, and knowing you to bee men of more
vertue, and deerer in my respect intend them to be yours.
   [$ (^Went.^) $] We shal honor thee.
   [$ (^Bar.^) $] But how Butler. [$ (^Bu.^) $] I am now 
going to their place of residence, scituate in the choisest place in #
the

<P G2R>
where you shal meet me, but ask not for me, only walk too and fro
and to auoid suspition you may spende some conference with           #

window which is opposite,
I wil make you knowne to your desired beauties, commende the

to
make you bee beloued where you shall firste kisse, then Woe, at
length Wed, and at last bed my Noble harts.
   [$ (^Both.^) $] O Butler.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Wenches bona robes, blessed beauties, without      #
colour or
counterfet: Away, put on your best Cloaths, get you to the
Barbers, Curle vp your haire, walke with the best strouts you can, you   
shal see more at the Window, and I ha vowd to make you.

These men like Fish, do swim within one streame,
Yet theyd eat one another, making no Conscience
To drinke with them theyd poyson, no offence,
Betwixt their thoughts and actions haue controle,
But headlong run, like an vnbiacst Bowle,
Yet I will throw them on, but like to him,

Combine with mine, and let our soules
Like Turtles haue a mutual Simpathy,
Who loue so well, that they together die,
Such is my life, who couets to expire,
If it should loose your loue.

a greater

her: Prethy hart as I said, I long, and in good troth I do, and
methinkes thy first childe wil bee borne without a nose, if I loose my
longing, tis but for a trifle too, yet methinkes it wil do me no good
vnlesse thou effect it for me. I could take thy keyes my selfe, go
into thy Closet, and read ouer the deeds and euidences of thy Land,
& in reading ouer them, reioice I had such blest fortune to haue so
fayre a wife with so much endowment, and then open thy Chests,

hundreds a yeare, seuerall Lord-ships, Mannours Houses, 
Thousands of poundes in your great Chests, Iewels, Plate, and Ringes

So like falce coyne, being put vnto the touch,

neuer marry but to one that was rich, and to be thus cunnicacht.
Who do you thinke this is Gentlemen?
   [$ (^went.^) $] Why your wife, Who should it be else?
   [$ (^Ilf.^) $] Thats my misfortune, that marrying her in hope she #

In shape and riches, and my selfe a knaue.
For tho my wealth raisd some to paint their doore,
Tis shut against me, saying I am but poore:
Nay, euen the greatest arme, whose hand hath grast,
My presence to the eye of Maiesty, shrinkes back,
His fingers cluch, and like to lead,
They are heauy to raise vp my state, being dead.
By which I find, spendthriftes, and such am I,
Like strumpets florish, but are foule within,
And they like Snakes, know when to cast their skin.                  #

Can coole it selfe to temper by refusall,
Turne or thou dyest.
   [$ (^Scar.^) $] Away.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] I do not wish to kill thee like a slaue,
That taps men in their cups, and broch their harts,
Eare with a warning peece they haue wakt their eares,
I would not like to powder shoote thee downe,
To a flat graue, ere thou hast thought to frowne:
I am no Coward, but in manly tearmes,
And fayrest oppositions vow to kill thee.
   [$ (^Scar.^) $] From whence proceedes this heat.

My blood growes hot for vengeance, thou hast spent
My liues reuenewes that our parents purchast.

[$ (^Here the Brothers ioyne, driue the rest out,

   [$ (^Scar.^) $] Brother I thanke you, for you now haue bin
A patron of my life, forget the sinne
I pray you, which my loose and wastfull houres,
Hath made against your Fortunes, I repent em,
And wish I could new ioynt and strength your hopes,
Tho with indifferent ruine of mine owne.
I haue a many sinnes, the thought of which
Like finisht Needles pricke me to the soule,
But find your wronges, to haue the sharpest point.
If penitence your losses might repayre,
You should be rich in wealth, and I in care.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] I do beleeue you Sir, but I must tell you,
<P I1V>
Euils the which are gainst an other done,
Repentance makes no satisfaction
To him that feeles the smart. Our father sir,
Left in your trust my portion: you ha spent it,
And suffered me (whilst you in ryots house,
A drunken Tauerne, spild my maintainance
Perhaps vpon the ground with ouerflowne cups,
Like birds in hardest winter halfe starud, to flie)
And picke vp any food, least I should die.
   [$ (^scar.^) $] I prethee let vs be at peace together.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] At peace for what? For spending my inheritance,
By yonder sun that euery soule has life by,
As sure as thou hast life Ile fight with thee.
   [$ (^Scar.^) $] Ide not be moou'd vntoot.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] Ile kill thee then, wert thou now claspt
Within thy mother, wife, or childrens armes.
   [$ (^scar.^) $] Wouldst homicide? art so degenerat?
Then let my blood grow hot.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] For it shall coole.

   [$ (^Tho.^) $] Hart, what makst thou here?

That scarce can make a fit distinction
Betwixt each other. Are you not Brothers?
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] I renounce him.
   [$ (^scar.^) $] Shalt not need.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] Giue way.
   [$ (^scar.^) $] Haue at thee,
   [$ (^Io.^) $] Who sturs, which of you both hath strength within   #
his arm
To wound his owne brest, whose so desperate,
To dam himselfe by killing of himselfe,
Are you not both one flesh?
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] Hart, giue me way.
   [$ (^sca.^) $] Be not a bar betwixt vs, or by my sword
Ile mete thy graue out.
   [$ (^Ioh.^) $] O do, for Gods sake do?
<P I2R>
Tis happy death, if I may die and you
Not murther one another. O do but harken,
When dus the Sunne and Moone borne in one frame
Contend, but they breed Earthquakes in mens harts:
When any starre prodigiously appeares,
Tels it not fall of kings or fatall yeares.
And then if Brothers fight, what may men thinke,
Sinne growes so high, tis time the world should sinke.
   [$ (^scar.^) $] My hart growes coole againe, I wish it not.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] Stop not my fury, or by my life I sweare,
I will reueale the robbery we ha done,
And take reuenge on thee,
That hinders me to take reuenge on him.
   [$ (^Io.^) $] I yeild to that, but neare consent to this,
I shall then die as mine owne sinne affords,
Fall by the law, not by my Brothers swords.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] Then by that light that guids me here I vow,
Ile straight to Sir Iohn Harcop, and make knowne
We were the two that robd him.
   [$ (^Io.^) $] Prethy do.
   [$ (^Tho.^) $] Sin has his shame, and thou shalt ha thy due.      #
[$ (^Exit.^) $]
   [$ (^Io.^) $] Thus haue I shewne the nature of a Brother,
Tho you haue prou'd vnnaturall to me.
Hees gone in heate to publish out the theft,
Which want and your vnkindnes forcst vs to,
If now I die that death and publicke shame,
Is a Corsiue to your soule, blot to your name. [$ (^Exit.^) $]

That scarse am (^Atlas^) to hold vp mine owne,
And al to good for me. A happy Creature
In my Cradle, and haue made my selfe
The common curse of mankind by my life,
Vndone my Brothers, made them theeues for bread,
And begot pretty children to liue beggers,
O Conscience, how thou are stung to thinke vpont,
<P I2V>
My Brothers vnto shame must yeeld their blood,
My Babes at others stirrops beg their food,
Or else turne theeues [^SOURCE TEXT: theenes^] to, and be choakt fort,
Die a Dogs death, be percht vpon a tree,
Hang betwixt heauen and earth, as fit for neither,
The curse of heauen thats due to reprobates,
Discends vpon my Brothers, and my children,
And I am parent to it, I, I am parent to it.

   [$ (^But.^) $] Heeres felowes swarme like flies to speake with you.
   [$ (^Scar.^) $] What are they?
   [$ (^But.^) $] Snakes I thinke Sir, for they come with stinges in #

mouths, and their tongues are turnd to teeth to: They claw 
Villanously, they haue eate vp your honest name, and honourable
reputation by railing against you, and now they come to deuoure 
your possessions.
   [$ (^Scar.^) $] In playner Euargy, what are they, speake?
   [$ (^But.^) $] Mantichoras, monstrous beastes, enemies to mankinde,
that ha double rowes of teeth in their mouthes. They are Vsurers,
they come yawning for mony, & the Sheriffe with them, is come
to serue an extent vppon your Lande, and then cease on your
bodie by force of execution, they ha begirt the house round.
   [$ (^Scar.^) $] So that the roofe our Auncestors did build
For their sonnes comfort, and their wiues for Charity,
I dare not to looke out.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Besides Sir, heres your poore children.
   [$ (^scar.^) $] Poore children they are indeede.
   [$ (^But.^) $] Come with fire and water: teares in their eies,    #

greefe in their harts, and desire to speake with you.
   [$ (^scar.^) $] Heape sorrow vpon sorrow? Tell me, are
My brothers gone to execution?
For what I did, for euery haynous sin,
Sits on his soule by whom it did begin.
And so did theirs by me. Tell me withall,
My children carry moysture in their eyes,
Whose speaking drops, say father, thus must we

Aske our reliefe, or die with infamy,
For you ha made vs beggers. Yet when thy tale has kild me
to giue my passage comfort from this stage,
Say all was done by inforst marriage:
My graue will then be welcome.
   [$ (^But.^) $] What shall we do sir?
   [$ (^scar.^) $] Do as the deuill dus, hate panther-mankind,
And yet I lie: for deuils sinners loue,
When men hate men, tho good like some aboue.

But had hands knit as fellons that weare fetters
Forst vpon them. For tell me woman,
Did ere my Loue with sighs intreat thee mine,
Did euer I in willing conference,
Speake words, made halfe with teares that I did loue thee.
Or was I euer
But glad to see thee as al Louers are.
No, no, thou knowst I was not.
   [$ (^Ka.^) $] O me.

   [$ (^Scar.^) $] But when I came to Church, I did there stand
All water, whose forcst breach had drownd my Land,
Are you my wife, or these my children?
Why tis impossible, for like the skies,
Without the sunnes light, so looke al your eies,
Darke, Clowdy, thicke, and ful of heauines,

Within my Country there was hope to see 
Me and my yssue to be like our fathers,
Vpholders of our Country, al our life,

For wife of mine thou art not, and these thy Basterds
Whom I begot of thee, with this vnrest,
That Bastards borne, are borne not to be Blest

Thou an Adulteresse in thy married armes.
And they that made the match, bawds to thy lust:
I, now you hang the heade, shouldst ha done so before,
Then these had not bin Bastards, thou a whore.

In doing deeds so base, so vild as these,
