PATTENT.}]
   [$ (^Pattent^) $]
Whether in such hast Mr. (^Upright^) ; you
looke as if you did not know me.
   [$ (^Upright.^) $] 
I doe indeed Sir, yet I am perswaded I have
seene you; and now I thinke ont, 'twas at the
Sessions house.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] 
Right Sir, my name is (^Pattent^) ; I endited
(^Mr. Chambergaine^) for receiving of Inmates:
   [$ (^Upright.^) $] 
I perfectly remember you good (^Mr. Pattent^) ;
how go's [^SOURCE TEXT: go,s^] trading with you now, I am afraid wee
shall have a dead time on't, you have little to doe
I thinke; when (^Summer^) comes Pattents grow
out of date.
<P A2R>
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] You are in the right sir, and which is
worse, the City had rather goe wetshod then
have them brought vp againe
   [$ (^Up.^) $] Say you so, troth I cannot much blame
them, for to say truth, you have not made them
serviceable for the Common wealth, you have
onely a respect to your private gaine Master
Pattent, you got sweetly for the time they 
lasted.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] By your favour Master (^Vpright^) , now
you talke of deceit in Trading, I must tell you
your owne too: did you never vent Calves
Leather for Neate, and oftentimes for Spanish to
some ignorant Customers: nay now you tell me
of vnserviceable ware, how many of the Kings
Subjects have you put in the stockes without
authority not vagrants and Beggars, but
Gentlemen, Marchants, Citizens, with their wives and
aughters.

   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] I vnderstand your wit: you meane
that I have made their shooes too little for them.

   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Yes sir,
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] They had better be in the Shoomakers
stacks, then be so gauled by Pattents as they
have beene.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] I doe not thinke but you have dranke your
<P A2V>
Mornings draught in Wormewood Beere Mr.
(^Vpright^) .
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] Why?
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] You fall so bitter vpon me:
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] I shall be bitterer ere we part Master
Pattent.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Doe thy worst Shoomaker.
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] No no no, not the worst neither:
The best I have to tell you will make you madd
enough, doe you remember when you were
Constable Master (^Pattent^) , when you tooke me in
your watch on Crispine and Crispianus Night,
and carried me to the Counter.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Ha ha ha, yes I doe, I doe.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Doe you laugh at it.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Yes faith, I remember you went
beyond your Last then.
   [$ (^Vpright:^) $] 
I remember thou wer't the troublesom'st
tyrannicall Constable that ever knock'd down
iniquity with a painted staffe: Thou would'st have
a finger in every mans businesse, thy very name
was hatefull, if they did but heare of (^Pattent^) they
were danted, thou hast had a pernicious wit, or
else thou could'st never overcome Scriveners
and Brokers, they have curst thee sufficiently,
the low Country Butter-boxes wished tenne
<P A3R>
hundred thousand tunne of Devill take thee,
because they were forced to waight for Butter till
you brought the transporters to composition:
And what had your Loggerhead to doe with Mr.
(^Logwood^) the (^Dyer^) ; thou wilt vndertake to teach
people to dye well, and thy selfe could'st never
live well.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] Very good.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Not very bad sir, 'tis you I am talking off,
doe you heare (^Pattent^) , the (^Spanish^) Marchant
(^Don tobacco^) vowes a revenge vpon thee, and I
much feare he will take thy life: for he sayes he
will send his two Faetors, (^Verinus^) and 
(^Mandungus^) to stifle thee.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] The devill he will, they are from him
already man he hath put them to boord in blind
Ale-houses.
   [$ (^Upright.^) $] No matter, ther's more wayes to
kill a Dog then hanging of him.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] A Dogge you Dunstable.
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] 
Yes you paper Kite, and now I talke of
hanging, there could not be so much as the hangmans
office to sell but Tyburne, and the rest of his
kindred must allow you a pention for it.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] So, so, so, can Saint (^Hugh^) and his 
bones protect you to talke thus liberally 
Shoomaker.
<P A3V>
   [$ (^Upright.^) $] Oh yes, yes, yes, thou giv'st me
authority, I know I may talke freely by patent my
friend:
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] It was Master (^Patent^) .
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] I that was when you traded in
sheepskins and Lambskins oh thou wer't a
precious Woolfe in Lambskinne.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] You will answer all this, will you
not.
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] No, I scorne it, I beleeve I have
spoke more then thou canst answer.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] But heark ye goodman Shoomaker.
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] Goodman Shoomaker, I deny and
defie the title. I am a Gentleman, my gentility
is of Antiquity, thou art an Upstart; Shooes
were made when thy villanous Pattents were
not thought on.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Well I may chance shortly brew a little
Wormewood for you.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Brew say you, you have brewed for vs
already I thanke you, all the Gentlemen
Cordwayners in St. Martins doe wish but to have 
the drowning of thee for abusing the Brewers:
which hath made them abuse vs and send vs
inchanted small Beere in stead of strong, before
you had a hand in the Brewhouse we could have
old (^English^) beere would makes all madde before
Munday noone, now tis so small we can scarce
<P A4R>
get drunke by (^Tuesday^) Night, a whole tunne of
our beere will scarce for a (^Dutchman^) ; this you
have done good Master Pattent.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Shall I be blam'd for this, I thinke I did
the Common wealth a great deale of good to
keepe it sober.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] I thou art a necessary member for in
keeping of them from being drunke, thou mak'st
them mad, as I am a Shoomaker and free of the
Cordwainers, every prentize I had came home
sober last (^Shrovetuesday^) night: It was not so I
am sure when I was a Lad:
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Hay, hay?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Yes and straw to, you put me well in mind
on't, the horses that had been well bred and
pamper'd in the Country, and had their allowance of 
hay freely, and lay at racke and manger, eat what
they would; now they are stinted: how many
pound of hay is there in a Load Mr. Pattent.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] I cannot tell?
   [$ (^Up.^) $] Wee must buy hay for our horses as we
buy figs by the pound, doe you beleeve when you
waighed Hay that Iustice held the Scales.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] I see you will have License?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Not from you Iack straw, vnlesse you
were in office againe?
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Iacke straw?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] I prethee answer me to one question and
<P A4V>
be just with me to a strawes breadth?
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Declare your wit?
   [$ (^Up.^) $] How many ounces of straw goes to the
littering of a Mad man a yeare in (^Bedlam^) .

   [$ (^Pat.^) $] 'Tis a madde question?
   [$ (^Up.^) $] I that's true, I know who I speake
to.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] Why doe you count me for a Mad
man.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] No for a wise man: and a man that hath had
experience ith mistery, this is no question for a
Mad man to answer:
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] It seemes your conversation is altogether
with wise acres: was it not you that asked the
silly question once; whether Red-herrings came
out of the red Sea or no.

   [$ (^Vp.^) $] No but it was you that made men pay as
deare for them, as if they came from thence, I
wonder you had nothing to doe with dainty blote
herring, blote, blote, or dryed Sprats; I beleeve
you had something to doe with Gudgeons, though
thy selfe art as miserable now as poore (^Iohn^)
was, is it not you that one Lent endited a poore
man of Felony for frying of Bacon.

   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] Of Fellony?
<P B1R>
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] Yes of Fellony, and you would needs
justifie it with an Act of Parliament, which when
one looked on it which had better eyes, it was
not frying of Bacon, but fiering a Beacon.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] Ha ha ha.
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] Doest thou laugh at thy owne
ignorance, doe you heare (^Patent^) , did I never know
you a Dunghill Raker.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] I a Dunghill raker, ye Pantoffle.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] I cry you mercy Sir, you did onely rake
them that raked Dunghills, looke too't, for there
is an army comming against thee, whose
weapons are strong yron hookes; the Captaine of
them is (^Tattardemalion Tagragg^) : those that be
vnder his command I shall nominate to thee.
(^Britch bottome out,
Ralph Patch and stitch,
Will worke and fast,
Hadge Leather Scrap,
Sam Scrape and take,
Daniell Dunghill Worke.^)
And a great many more out of my memory at
this time that have made vp a ragged Regiment
and vow no more to be obedient to thy authority
Moreover the Hop-Marchants have an 
intention [^SOURCE TEXT: intent.on AT LINE BREAK^] to marry all the  #
female Bonelace makers, and
get Children to fortifie themselves against thee
<P B1V>
they say if thou dost but come amongst their hops 
againe, they will scarce leave thee a leg to hop
away vpon, and the Bonelace-makers have taken
such spirit against thee, that in stead of 
Bone-Lace thou shalt returne with laced bones, and
take my word (^Pattent^) , thou hadst better be in the
middle of (^English^) pikes, then amongst their
(^Spanish^) needles.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Doe you hold any confedrase with this
lawlesse faction Mr. (^Vpright^) that you can so well
tell the manner of the revenges they will execute
vpon me.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] I promise thee I doe not thinke but they
will burne thee when all comes to all, and ther's                    #
[^SOURCE TEXT: ther s^]
an end of (^Pattent^) .
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] It must be some of your female
Bonelacemakers then, I care not a button for the rest
of the Rebellions.
   [$ (^Up.^) $] Don't you care a button? Master (^Panyer^)
in (^Hoope Ally^) will make you care a button, why
thou Iack in a boxe, could'st not thou be content
to gaine Authority amongst the Buttonmakers
of (^Amsterdam^) , where the sisterhood might have
payed thee tribute; besides Buttons for thy
breeches.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Yes when their breeches make buttons,
have I lived after that rate to goe secured among
Precisions you vagrants.
<P B2R>
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Among Precisians you puppie, what need
you confine your selfe to one Sect when there is
so much division amongst them.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] That's all one, they hold the greatest sway
who care no more for knocking a mans braines
out in zeale, or for the good of the common cause:
then I for philiping a flie to death, I would not be
within y=e= jurisdiction of new (^England^) for a million.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Nay I thinke thou hadst better be in the
great (^Maguls^) Countrie:
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Or have been Page to Sir (^John 
Mandevill^) , I should hope to returne with more security.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Well, but now we have been in 
(^Amsterdam^) , (^New England^) , and (^Magoll^) ; let vs returne
to old (^England^) againe, where there is many
honest men will welcome you home, one Mr. (^Cipres^) .
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Oh, the Hatband maker.
   [$ (^Up.^) $] Then theres another one Mr (^Kitling^) .
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] A fiddlestring maker?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Master (^Clay^) :
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] A Tobackopipe maker?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Master Glasse (^Eyes^) .
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] A Spectacle maker?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Master (^Curry^) :
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] A Combmaker?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Doe you heare Pattent cannot you vance
all trades, how many Halls have you been free of:
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Whats that to thee?
<P B2V>
   [$ (^V.^) $] That is a question all men aske when they
are ashamed to give an answer.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Ashamed?
   [$ (^vp.^) $] Did I say thou wert ashamed:
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] 'Twas your pleasure?
   [$ (^vp.^) $] Give me thy hand I am sorry for it, I cry
thee mercy I tooke my markes amisse: Ile give
thee thy due for that efaith I thinke thou wert
ever shamelesse, have I hit the Naile on the head
now Smith, are you pleased:
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] You have spoken all?
   [$ (^vp.^) $] Not all, but I am drawing to an end?
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Would thou hadst spoke thy last once?
   [$ (^vp.^) $] I shall vexe thy soule first Sirrah,
vnlesse thou canst come off with good Language,
thou wilt suffer many Deaths in one, the
Hatband maker will choake thee or strangle thee
with (^Cipres^) , the Gutstring maker will make
strings of thy Guts which will cozen the
Fidlers most abhominably, for they will never
stand in Tune, the Tobackopipe makers,
Spectacle makers, and Combe makers, will
compound with the Dicemakers for thy bones
to make falce Dice with, and that's a way
to make thee as mischievous in thy Death
as thou wer't in thy lifetime, and if thy Bones
prove so deceitfull, we may very well turne the
tother end of an old Proverb, what was bred in
thy flesh will never out of thy bones.
<P B3R>
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] I have heard you, and doubt not the worst
their mallice aymes to inflict vpon me, I have
ere this my tragedy be brought to passe, contriv'd
a meanes to worke revenge on them.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Declare, I shall be glad to heare it, I always
had an itching desire to mischiefe as well as thou:
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Thus then, I will bring up a fashion
amongst some of our temporising gallants to
forsake the wearing of hatbonds, we will have all
our fiddle strings from (^Rome^) and (^Venice^) , and as
I am a Smith, I have a conceit to make yron 
tobacko pipes and steele Combes, and our old men
when they once grow dimme sighted, shall have
their writings read to them.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] I this is prety well, but not in your power
to perfect, this is a harder project vpon them, then
the first you had, it will be a hard matter to draw
the humours of the whole Kingdome to these
fashions: besides your yron worke will doe no
good, for we have many phantastike Company
keepers that onely take Tobacko to breake the
pipes, and shall we be beholding to other Nations
for fiddle strings or combe our heads with Horse
Combes. Besides ther's a strange conceit indeed
that all old men should have their writings read
to them, 'tis enough to vndoe halfe the old men in
the Kingdome, their Mistresses shall not send to
them letters of commendation, or places of new
<P B3V>
meeting, but they must be enforc'd to have their
wives to read them, and what inconveniency that
would bring, doe but judge: No no, this will not
doe Mr. (^Pattent^) , I am a little in hast, I thinke it
be dinner time, I will onely give you one item
more and then I'le leave you to your owne
direction, were you never acquainted with one Mr.
(^Fortune^) . [$ (^Pat.^) $] Yes, yes, a Horner.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Ware horns, take heed of him are you mari'd.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] What of that?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Take heed of him, that is all; I speake
as a Friend.
   [$ (^Pattent.^) $] Friendly councell.
   [$ (^Vpright.^) $] It is so, then doe not you know
Mr. Kill Cow.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Yes the Butcher.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] The very same, he hath a great many friends
abroad, so hath (^Ball^) his Dog, be sure you goe not
through field lane, Newgate market, Butcher
row, St. (^Nicholas^) shambles, East Cheape, or
(^Southwark^) , there is wait laid for thee in all these
places, and if they meet thee thou wilt be stucke
fuller of Skuers then a Surloyne of roast beefe
at (^Christmas^) is stucke with Rosemary: And by
all meanes come not neare the Beare garden for
beares and Dogs are friends and all agree, on
thee to act a bloody Tragedy.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Well sirrah, you are a railing fellow, I'le
talke no more to you?
<P B4R>
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] One cold word more good Master (^Pattent^) .
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] But sirrah why doth these things trouble
you so much?
   [$ (^Up.^) $] I tell thee my name is (^vpright^) my nature
is like vnto my name, and I defie such juggling
in a Common-wealth, it makes my honest
countrymen beg in a land of plentie; I have somthing
to say to you (now I consider (^Christmas^) is so
neare) concerning Cards. What new game have
you set a foot, that the knave of Dyamonds doth
cozen the king of Hearts and all his Subjects to
the very Ace, y'are a sure Card sirrah, when 
(^Pattent^) deales, all the rest doe but hold Cards.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Why not, why I tell thee I will cozen
my Father at Cards.
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] Prethee doe not sweare I'le beleeve thee,
the Father quoth he, I the Father of thy
Country -- you are going now, you doe not love to
heare of your faults, I have onely one thing more
to say to thee, & then fire or y=e= Iakes consume thee.
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] I thanke you sir, spit out your spleene, what
is your next venome?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] No venome vpon my credit, now I have
laid open thy soule inside, I will give thee a purge
that is with Soape:
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] With Soape?
   [$ (^Vp.^) $] With Sope, I with Sope, that was a purge
deere enough as you order'd it, all the good
<P B4V>
Huswives in (^London^) , and those that take a pride in
cleane linnen, have an intention to wash thee
cleere from all thy former villanies; but I am 
afraid they will doe no good vpon thee, they will be
enforced at last to hang thee vp for the signe of y=e=
Labour in vaine, which is the end I bequeath thee
too, and though I am no Barbar good Mr. (^Pattent^) ,
I must leave you ith suds at this time, for I have
talk'd my selfe weary, my shop Iournimen and
prentises expect me, if you have any thing to say
to me, you know St. (^Martins^) , I will not change
my house now the world is in hope of
reformation. So good even sweet Master (^Pattent^) .
   [$ (^Pat.^) $] Farewell sir?
And though these things I can no longer 
thrive by,
Hang him that wants, who hath all Trades
to live by.
(^And so Master Patten,
Pray learne this mattin,
The seat which you sat in,
In your furs and your satten
Must now be forsaken,
Your knavery is taken,
And toth Devill removed,
Your dearly beloved.^)
