DIALOGUE 
BETWEEN
(^RALPH MIXINGTON^) , A CITY VINTNER,
AND 
(^JENNY^) HIS WIFE.}]
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] A Fine Trade this! Mr. (^Mixington^) when our own  #
Trade declines so visibly.
   [$ (^R.^) $] What! Was it for this you Leer'd upon me so, and     #
wink'd me up into
the Bed-Chamber? I thought I should have been quit of you for 2 or 3
dissembling Kisses, and parting with my Ready Cash, now I'm going    #
out of Town
this (^Saturday^) in the Afternoon.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Your ready Cash! I know of none you have; you're a #
Beggar in all Senses.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Well Madam, no matter whether I'm rich or poor, but  #
I can tell your
wealthy Ladyship, that all (^Lombard-street^) can't fill a Money Bag #
without a Bottom.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Oh my Heart [$ (^ (Cries) ^) $] Soh! To the Misery #
of approaching Poverty we
must have, aiming at Wit, come in for an additional Plague.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Let it approach as it will; a Jolly Conceit, a Merry #
Glass, and a Ratling
Noddle are proof against it, but a Wife clenches it to us; and such  #
a Wife too
as is a certain help-mate to Vexation.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] And yet without this Help-mate thou had'st been as #
wretched a
Stair-Ambler as ever carried a Role after an Oyster-woman.
   [$ (^R.^) $] And without this, Stair-Trotter, thou hadst been     #
still in an Eighteen-penny
Lodging in the noble (^White-Fryers^) , or a worse Place; and        #
Butter'd Wheat and
Cheese would never have plump'd up your Countenance to be the wonder
of the Ward.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Was it not by my Credit with the Merchants that I  #
set thee up?
   [$ (^R.^) $] Yes Madam, your Credit has been as remarkable as my  #
Reputation;
never was Man so set up: What between the (^Jews^) Synagogue, the    #
(^French^)
<P 2>
(^Hugonot^) , Phanatick-Meetings, and the Ambassadors                #
Popish-Chappel, I've had
more Religious and National Clubs to the Rigging me out, than there  #
go to
the compleating a Confederate-Army.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Ungrateful Wretch as thou art! Is this Requiting   #
thy poor Wife, and
the Worthy Gentlemen that put thee into Business?
   [$ (^R.^) $] Ay Child, and they put Business into thee, found     #
thee Employment, and
me Leisure, and now at last will do my Business.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Can you blame Careful Men for looking out, when    #
they meet an Owl
with a Wig like a new-Curl'd Distaff, with his Red top'd Tripe       
Jocky-Buskins, girdled about the Loins like a Monkey, Gallopping to  #
(^Epsom^) , and find
his House as Empty as an (^Islington^) Musick-House in the midst of  #
Winter.
   [$ (^R.^) $] And perhaps the poor Pains-taking Woman in her       #
Helmet of a
Vizard-Mask, and her Fighting-Suit without Stayes, is Galloping as   #
fast in a
Hackney-Coach with an Impudent, Chattering, Wall-Ey'd Forreigner to  #
the other
End of the Town.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Infamous Scandal! Your Servants, nay your self     #
know I constantly
keep home when you are out.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Yes, by the same Token I found you once in your      #
Chamber, when I
came Home unexpectedly, with a Touz'd Head, a Breast open (for Air I
suppose) a blowzing Colour, two Bottles and Dr. (^Pulse^) , and then #
'twas whisper'd,
(^Lord, my Dear, you come most opportunely to give the Doctor a Fee  #
for Relieving
me from the Terriblest Fit I ever felt^) , (and thou hast (^felt^)   #
many, that I'll say) so
the Doctor, though I gave him a good Fee, look'd like a Fool, thou   #
like a
Beast, and I like a Monster.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Thou deserv'st it for censuring me so barbarously  #
that was at Death's Door.
   [$ (^R.^) $] No. no, thy Chief Confident, Sandy-hair'd (^Sue^)    #
shou'd have been at the
Door. How could the Doctor, (whom the Devil Pill) relieve thee, when
(^Sam. Bum-poke^) the Apothecary had not been in the House with any  #
Medicine.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] With his own Drops out of his Pocket.
   [$ (^R.^) $] And two Bottles of (^Burgundy^) .
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Yes Wretch, of the same that I Dog'd two Hampers   #
full to the
black-Ey'd Damsel's Lodgings in (^Covent-garden^) , that went for    #
the Wife of a
Custom-House Officer, who was decipher'd to me with your very        #
Cloaths, Sneer, and Nose.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Not quite so exactly as your tall Ladyship and       #
Orange-colour'd (^Sue^) were
describ'd coming out of Chambers in the (^Temple^) on a (^Monday^)   #
Morning, when
Lord knows ever since (^Saturday^) Afternoon you were at Alderman    #
(^Rounceful's^)
Country-House with his Lady.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Your Informer was a Villain and a Lyar; but what   #
can I expect from
one that must have his Whisk-playing Meetings, his Joaking Clubs,    #
and Tribe
of Wits about him, Trip-writers, Ballad-Scribes, and City Poets.
   [$ (^R.^) $] A better Assembly than your dear Mrs. (^Gulpington^) #
the Midwife, Madam
(^Franshimange^) the (^French^) Mantua-maker, the (^Indian^) Woman,  #
Mrs. (^Decoy^) , and
Col. (^Quester's^) Tricking Widdow, that is both Jacobite and        #
(^Dutch-woman^) ,
Merchandizer, Wit and Bawd, (^Jew^) and (^Gentile^) .
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Foul Mouth, you measure others by your Heathenish  #
self, and Paganly
Companions.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Prithee when thou Attack'st my Christianity, don't   #
clap in the (^Jew^) too,
thou hast too much Skill in Circumcision.
<P 3>
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Brute -- you had been low enough but for some of   #
them; is not Wealth
your Aim?
   [$ (^R.^) $] Ay (^Jenny^) , and if Pleasure is thine, prithee     #
take a better Mark; by (^Bacchus^) ,
it's the Devil indeed to have an Envoy Extraordinary from him in a
Composition of cheating an (^Amsterdammer^) , a Pagode (^Mulatto     #
Portuguese^) : Why I'd
as live be Rivall'd by the (^Man-Teger^) .
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] [$ (^ (Laughs) ^) $] Well, well, you express your  #
self Whimsically, I'll pass by
your Scurrilous Malice, and give you your Saying and your Way.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Ay (^Jenny^) , and my Reward too when time serves    #
[$ (^ (aside) ^) $] either the Jade has
hit my blind-side, or I have really conquer'd her by my Wit. Gad, I  #
think too,
thou Ape, that thou hast Wit, tho' thou wert plaguy silent before I  #
had thee.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] You took me for my (^Beauty^) , and swore I        #
excelled all the Colours that
ever glorious Wine reflected on Mortals, and my Kisses more          #
delicious than any
Nectar the Sun ever began, or Artist finish'd from the Grape, and if #
you find
some Wit and Sense besides, it's more than expected, and above the   #
bargain.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Ay (^Jenny^) , 'tis more, as the (^Witch^) covenants #
with the (^Devil^) for Wealth,
and has Damnation into the bargain.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Well express'd, but come (^Rafee`^) [$ (^ (stroaks #
him) ^) $] no more Satyr.
   [$ (^R.^) $] Well (^Jenny^) , no more Swaggering nor Uneasiness,  #
and to satisfie thee, things
are better than thou think'st; for the 2 Country Vintners, and the   #
Widow of the
Inn that I fear'd would have sunk me float aloft bravely, are able   #
to pay me,
and let me get twice as much by 'em.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Prithee how?
   [$ (^R.^) $] Why (^Bob Cyder-Twist^) has an Uncle, Teacher to a   #
private Congregation,
that's dead, and left him 3000 (^l.^) I wish he don't leave off our  #
Trade and
succeed him in his.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Never fear it, he's too much a Rake.
   [$ (^R.^) $] O Lard! fie! When a Man is Wealthy, he is always     #
Reform'd.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] And (^Nick Shatter^) .
   [$ (^R.^) $] His Elder (^Brother's^) dead, and has left him 300   #
(^l. per An.^) He's to marry,
and has already converted his Cousin the Crooked One-ey'd Quaker,    #
and I have
a Letter for thee to buy them all Necessaries for the Wedding; but   #
the sharp
Western Widow (^Scramble^) , is a Jewel.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] How? (^Rafee^) !
   [$ (^R.^) $] She and her Quarter-master Capt. (^Slice^) did the   #
business, (^Slice^) gets old
Aforesaid the Attorney's Daughter (^Nell^) with Bastard, the old     #
Rogue sends her to
the (^West Indies^) , then marries (^Scramble^) , and she has clapt  #
him into a (^Mad house^) .
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Get in that Debt immediately, take care of that    #
same Quarter-master.
   [$ (^R.^) $] No fear -- I have them both under (^Black^) and      #
(^White^) , (^Wax^) and (^Parchment^) ,
(^Lock^) and (^Key^) ; I'm her Trustee, the Money is order'd, and as #
much more as takes
off all the Trash in my Cellar.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Now (^Rafe^) , to satisfie thee, things are better #
than thou think'st, for lift
up that Cloath, there's an (^Indian^) Cabinet worth 80 Pound sent me #
from 
(^Rump-Enough^) the (^Dutchman^) , in it (^Indian^) Silks,           #
(^Flanders^) Lace, (^Holland^) and Muslin
enough to Rig me like a Queen this 7 Years, and as many              #
(^Bank-Bills^) as will twice
pay (^Goatherd^) our Roguish Merchant.
<P 4>
   [$ (^R.^) $] O the Confounded (^Low-Country^) Miser! Who could    #
have thought it of
him. But (^Jenny^) , What hast thou done for this? -- A bold         #
Question! Ha -- Well,
no Matter.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Nay Sir, What am I to do for it, for that's the    #
Matter?
   [$ (^R.^) $] Why, that's as thou pleasest to make out.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] (^Rafee^) , Don't look so surly; Why that I can    #
Child; Look here!
   [$R.$] Bless me! it's his own Hand too, the plainest Instructions #
that ever Satan's
Plenipotentiaries manag'd since (^Amboyna^) .
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Yes, hearty ones, first to rob thee, get all the   #
Money I cou'd, then to
follow him to (^Holland^) , and for fear of thy Loving or Violent    #
Temper to leave
this Cordial Powder in thy Guts, which in a Week wou'd have sent     #
thee to
another World, as surely as a brace of Balls thro' thy Head; he was  #
his
Crafts-Master, and had learnt it of his Country Men, when at their   #
(^Indian Batavia^) ,
thither we were to go, and from thence to some Delightful            #
(^Islands^) , where he
was to Govern, and to be a Queen at least, till he was pleas'd to    #
Spice my Porridge.
   [$R.$] O hellish Usurer, this Cabinet and the Contents thereof    #
were put to
Interest for a Notable Return. But how didst get into his Confidence?
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] By my Out-side, thro' his Eyes into his Heart, as  #
he said, and by my
Wit into his Imagination. He Sacramented I should out-blaze all      #
(^India^) , that
Monarchs would be proud to lie at my Feet: O my Conscience, now it   #
comes
into my Head, the Dog wou'd have sold me to some sad-Colour'd        #
(^Mamamouchi^) ;
He lov'd Money excessively, was above 50 Years old, and certainly    #
had much
more Occasion for that, than such a Thing as I. This Tide, and this  #
Wind will
in two days waft him to (^Holland^) , whither such a Scrole shall be #
sent, as may
make him wish himself in (^India^) before that time, and perhaps     #
make a farther
Penny of him.
   [$R.$] Content. Now (^Jenny^) , I'll tell thee what made our      #
other Merchant, Sir
(^Flat-face Puppy^) , scatter Words and Threats about my Credit, to  #
make thee
Uneasy, and endeavour to make me Ridiculous.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] I'll be hang'd if 'twan't thy damned Wit.
   [$R.$] Even so. Thou knowest he is a Knave, a Coward, and a       #
peevish Ass;
One that I guess'd since to be his Concubine, lik'd my Person and    #
Chat at the
Wells, and was smart upon him. I knowing him, seconded it, compar'd  #
him to
a Monks Flat Phyz, in an old Cathedral Window, his (^Bum^) to a      #
(^Base-Viol^) and
his gate to a swimming Pig, and his whole Person, to the red and     #
yellow
Pictures of (^Some body, and no body^) in a Country Alehouse; some   #
Spy upon her
I suppose publish'd it. I don't owe the Dog 50 (^l.^) and defy him.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] Thou fool of a Wit; employ thy Sense in thy        #
Profession to get Wealth
and Pleasure at other Peoples Expence, and joyn with me in carrying  #
on our
Happiness, and in order to it, I will ever be Loving to thee and Easy.
   [$R.$] And silent! And for thy sake I will be Diligent and        #
Industrious.
   [$ (^Jen.^) $] And blind! -- Hold, What Noise is that in the next #
Room!
   [$R.$] O my Soul, these Dogs the Drawers have left it open, some  #
body came
thither from to'ther Room. Ay by (^Jove^) ! A Gentleman in Red goes  #
down
Laughing, and puts a Paper and Pencil into his Pocket.

[}(^A DIALOGUE BETWEEN MR.^) NEHEMIAH TRAP, (^A REFORMER OF
MANNERS, AND CAPT.^) FLOURISH, (^AN OFFICER IN THE GUARDS^) .}]

   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Well Captain, I am glad of the Honour of your     #
Company to
this Choice Glass of Wine. I wish I had as good Company to
Entertain you with, as you had when you Treated me at the
Tower.
   [$ (^Capt. F.^) $] Thank you Landlord; then send for your Wife.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] O dear Captain, Would she were here, I'm sure     #
she'd go all over the
Town to wait on you; but she is at my Neighbour (^Smuggle's^)        #
Child's Christning,
he sent me this Wine; I'll assure you it never came near either      #
Cooper's or
Vintner's Cellar.
   [$ (^C. Fl.^) $] No, nor the Queen's Custom-house.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Pooh, no words -- Sincerely, my Friend is as      #
pretty a Trader as --
   [$ (^C. Fl.^) $] Ever sung (^Psalms^) , kept a (^Sabbath^) , or   #
Cheated his (^Prince^) or (^Neighbour^) .
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Well, we have it. No matter how.
   [$ (^Capt. Fl.^) $] As you have your Estates and Credit.
   [$ (^Neh. T.^) $] I'll say it sincerely, my Friend (^Smuggle^) is #
one of my (^Brother
Reformers^) , and understands Godliness notably.
   [$ (^Capt. Fl.^) $] To the Plague of all that know him, that are  #
not in the Secret of
his Gains.
   [$ (^N. Trap.^) $] O Sir, Sincerely he was much mov'd, and really #
so was I, at the
two Swearing young Ensigns at the Guard, and the black young         
Gentlewoman their Coz. that began Bumpers.
   [$ (^C. Fl.^) $] I plaid the young Rake and their Damsel at the   #
Hypocritical Puppy;
but sincerely Landlord of mine, for all your Reformation, you wou'd  #
have met
the (^Bowsy Madamoiselle^) privately; but the Jade was too Drunk to  #
understand her
own Interest.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Sincerely you Scandalize me; it was only to give  #
her good Counsel;
but however no words to my Wife.
   [$ (^C. Fl.^) $] No, no, if she knows you not, she understands    #
her self I hope;
but your brother Rogue, tho' he can stand a Chance Oath, or a Smutty #
word
slipt in Gentlemens Company; yet you both cou'd dispence with most   #
beastly
Lewdness in his dirty Confederate Rogues of (^Rumney Marsh^) , and   #
the two
(^Brandy Kentish^) Strumpets, when you brought me Sick up in the     #
Pleasure-boat.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] O dear Sir, People that are Employed in business  #
will have their
Frolicks sometimes, and must be humoured.
   [$ (^C. Fl.^) $] But if a poor Officer that can't say his Life's  #
his own for 3 Months,
gets a Glass Extraordinary, Swears by Chance at some unmannerly      #
Whelp, and
goes Singing to his Lodging; then it's, O the Debauchery of these    #
Soldiers!
the (^Protestant^) Cause can never prosper with such Fighters for    #
it; 'twas otherwise
in the Protector's time; when Landlord, thou art sensible, I know    #
thou comest
home well loaden five days in the Week from the Tavern.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Ay with Moderation --
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] That is just on this side of Reeling, with 3      #
Bottles in your Guts, a
grave Look, and a Hickup, and perhaps a Knavish Bargain in your      #
Pocket-book.
<P 6>
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] And you would not have a Man serious and follow   #
his Dealing with
Industry?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] No doubt, for you get by it. Faith Landlord, my   #
Ensign would
change his Colours for your Gains in the Company you are free of,    #
and I would
Swap my Commission for your Profits, in being a Top Parish Officer and
Reformer, besides Gut-Stuffing, and Guzzle into the bargain.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Fy, fie, I fack no such matter -- But who made    #
you so wise Captain?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Even your own bragging sweet Self in your         #
Moderation, and your
Spouse when you plague her with your Hypocrisy.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] I wish she had a greater Sense of the             #
(^Protestant^) Party and Reformation.
   [$ (^Capt. Fl.^) $] She is a Gentlewoman born, well bred, and     #
sensible, and abhors the
Canting and base Cruelty of your Reformers.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Well, you owe her a good word, you always have    #
hers.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I thank her.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Nay seriously, since you have Lodg'd in my House, #
my Wife is twice as
good Conditioned to me as she was before, and says you are the       #
Orderliest Lodger
in the World, and are always at Home when I am Sotting, as she calls #
it, at the Club.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Truly Mr. (^Trap^) , you are the greatest         #
corrupter of Youth, and the most
dangerous Person I come near; for I never drink more nor in worse    #
Company
than yours.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] What think you of the several Gentlewomen that    #
us'd to come to you
3 or 4 times a Week, to be Treated with your Cordial Water.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Pooh, my Soldiers Wives, Fool, that come about    #
Business.
   [$ (^Neh. T.^) $] What! in Silks, Sattin and Silver, tho indeed   #
sometimes a
Handsome one would come like a Servant (^Maid^) .
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] My Soldiers, like (^Smuggle^) and you, have more  #
Trades than one, and
maintain them well.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Well, but since my Wife perswaded you, I thank     #
you, you order them
to come to you upon the Guard about business.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I am willing to make any Family easie where I am.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Ay, Heavens reward you for it, that I have found. #
Come, here's
honest (^Smuggle's^) Health.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Ay, his Wives with all my Heart. Why are not you  #
Gossip?
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] He would have had me, but Mrs. (^Smuggle^) would  #
have young Mr. (^Smyrna^)
the (^Turkey^) Merchant's Beau Prentice, and Monsieur (^de la        #
Fripponniere^) the (^French^)
Merchant.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] What, that Synagogue fac'd (^Hugonot^) , that     #
from a Footman became a
Pocket Pedlar for Table-books and Tweezers at Noblemens Levys, then a
Peruke-Maker and Wine-brewer, next an Alamode Runner, and now dub'd a
Merchant.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] O dear Captain, you come too home to Folks        #
Originals, you are a
notable Satyrical Wit. I fack, I love Sharpness; and my Wife says    #
you are
like the (^Plain Dealer^) in the Play, and for that she values you.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] She is so far in the right, that I am as great a  #
Bubble and Fool as he, and
am as often teazed with damned Company; But why are not you at the   #
Christning?
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] For five Reasons, my dear Capt. First, my         #
(^Nelly^) ordered me to Treat
you. Next, there is one I do not care to see till a Scurvy business  #
is made up
between us. Thirdly, Mrs. (^Smuggle^) rails at me ever since our     #
(^Kentish^) Voyage
<P 7>
with those merry Women, which she got an (^Item^) of; And next I     #
expect three
Constables, five Informers, and my (^Brother Reformer^) Justice      #
(^Peerwell^) ; and then
an old rich Merchant's only Son is to have some Dealings with me,    #
and Coll.
(^Plater^) of (^Spring-garden^) .
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Really all very good ones: I was Invited, but     #
would not go; the Men
I don't like, and the Women I can wait on another time, and to Night #
must go
to (^Windsor^) .
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Come, (^Captain^) , here's to the Confederates.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Ay the Queen's Health with all my Soul, and       #
Prosperity to her Arms.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Oh Captain, if your Success in War went on as     #
briskly against the
French, as our Reformation of Manners does against Whores, Swearers, #
and
(^Sunday^) Taverns, it would be brave.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Nay I wish we could lay the (^French^) and        #
(^Spanish^) under as good Contribution,
as you do your sinful Tributaries, and it would save 12 (^d.^) in    #
the Pound Tax at least.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Supposing it true; the Wicked should be punished  #
all manner of ways.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Not with greater Wickedness; for, Conniving at    #
Sin for Gain, Selling
of Justice, ensnaring of Innocents, and often Oppressing those who   #
have no
Money; putting some into such Places of admirable Improvement, that  #
those
who went in only (^Whores^) , come out (^Whores^) and (^Thieves^) ,  #
is as bad as the
Crimes they are Committed for.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] Zeal for Reformation may be excused, if it carry  # 
a Man a little too far.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Yes, to the fulfilling his Pride, Malice, and     #
Ill-nature, as well as his
Covetousness.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] So -- Satyrical Captain; And have you nothing to  #
say against strict
keeping the Sabbath?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] No Mr. (^Jew^) , you have my free Leave to go to  #
the Devil as painfully
as an (^Indian^) Jogue, or a (^Capuchin^) Fryer. Only of all things  #
a Generous
Temper abhors a Hypocrite.
   [$ (^N.^) $] Would you have no Reformation?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Yes, our Laws are good and ought to have better   #
Executors of them,

   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Very sharp.

Brethren, who
won't know you; or your Bubbles, who don't know you; or your         #
Subjects who
dare not know you. But my dear Landlord, Here's to thy own           #
Reformation
and Health. I do know thee.

Argue it out with you.
Come, dear Capt. put off your Journey to (^Windsor^) till to Morrow. #
I have a Neat
Supper; here is more of this Wine; my Wife is a coming, and she      #
shall be Judge.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Content, provided you Teaze me no more with your  #
Seizing, Gaoling,
Fining, Whipping, and Reformation.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Agreed. (^Smuggle^) and I will put off our going   #
down the River till four
a Clock to morrow Morning. Shall I send for him?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] No -- As good Friends as we are, and as much as I #
love Diversion, I
won't trust my self with Two of you at a time together; and then we  #
should
not be upon the Square neither, unless I could get (^Titus O--^) the #

<P 8>
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I beg your Pardon, you are all (^Protestants^)    #
alike.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] But Capt. Cou'd you harbour such a Thought as to   #
imagine we would
betray or injure you?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I believe you would not; but WE might; Assemblies #
of you cannot
blush. I once saw in (^Wales^) a Generous, Stout Mastiff, for one    #
Grumble only, torn
to pieces by a Herd of well Acorn'd, and I suppose Reforming Hogs.   #
The best

Cowardly, Grunting and Squealing, like you (^Manners Menders^) .
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Envy it self could not take hold of you.

Family starving, as

[}BETWEEN CAPT. (^FL.^) MR. (^NEH. TRAP^) , AND MRS. (^TRAP^) .}]

   [$ (^C. F.^) $] Madam, I am glad you are come.
   [$ (^Mrs.^) $] And I am as glad I am come from such Odious        #
Company, to so good.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] (^Nelly^) , thou art to be Judge between the       #
Captain and I about
Reformation of Manners. The Capt. has put off his Journey. I've got  #
a good Supper,
and We'll enjoy our selves.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] If you don't sour it with the Relation of your  #
Noble Campaign to
(^Trappanning, Jayls, Whippings^) , and (^Robbing^) at the Head of   #
your (^Mirmidon
Informers^) , and (^Catch-Poles^) .
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] No Madam, You are to see fair play, he is to      #
maintain his Cause decently,
and has promis'd to Teize us no more with it.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] With all my heart; nay I could bear with all    #
his wicked Stuff for
your Conversation; upon my Life I have need of something Agreeable,  #
I'm
almost burst with the Vapours, rais'd by abominable Doings at the    # 
Christning.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Madam, Won't a Relation of the Impertinences      #
continue them?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] No: You Men will be apt to say I am so much a   #
Woman, that
Reflections upon the (^Ridicule^) , will be a (^Prescription^) to    #
contribute to the (^Cure^) .
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Now we are going to have my (^Brother Smuggle^)    #
pull'd to pieces, because
he is no Roistering Spark; but the Comfort is, he is a Man of        #
Substance.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] A man of the Devil! -- Substantially wicked,    #
I'm sure.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I hope your Relation will be a Lesson to Mr.      #
(^Trap^) , to shew how Wealth
that's Got Knavishly, is Spent as Foolishly.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] You Two were expected, for the People there     #
were a Select
Company, as he call'd it, at this private Christning. First The      #
(^Occasional Divine^)
that can dispence with the Cross, and all Ceremonies and Order as    #
well as
<P 9>
Honesty. Then Spruce Mr. (^Smyrna^) , Monsieur                       #
(^de la Fripponniere^) , (^Mongrell^) the
Inn-keeper, and Owler of (^Rumney Marsh^) ; Mrs. (^Goggle^) the Mrs. #
of the (^Phanatick
Boarding-School^) , (^Rachel^) her Leering Daughter, and             #
(^Satanago^) the (^Jew^) .
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] What a (^Jew^) at a (^Christian's^) Baptism, O    #
monstrous!
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Nay I believe he would have had him been       #
Godfather.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Why not; we've lately seen (^Jews^) made          #
Embassadors and Knights.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Truly then I interpos'd, and was forced to     #
Swagger down right
with the Beast (^Smuggle^) , to have him kept out of the Room during #
the Service,
while in the mean time, as I guess'd by the bustle over head, he was #
Russling
one of the Maids.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] We go to their Ceremonies; Why should not they     #  
come to ours?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Nay thou countest them both alike.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] When I urg'd and repeated to him it was a      #
Shame to Christianity,
he replied as fast, He was a good Man, and worth 30000 Pound.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Were you well Treated?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Most profusely: Mrs. (^Smuggle^) and           #
(^Smyrna^) had order'd it nicely,
only (^Fripponniere^) that was never brought up to any thing but     #
(^Barly-Bread^) , (^Garlick^) ,
and (^Wooden Shoes^) , with his (^French^) Impudent Nonsense found   #
fault with every
thing, till I was forced to take him up a little roundly about his   #
own Original
and Education, and I think I work'd a Miracle, that is, Silenced     #
him, and put a
mixture of (^Brick^) Colour into his Phillamot Countenance.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] What become of the (^Levite^) ?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] He Eat and Drank devoutly, receiv'd his        #
Present, squees'd and
whisper'd Mrs. (^Rachel^) most vehemently, made an Assignation with  #
her, and
went his way first.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Thou art to Censorious.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] They were too Foolish, for she pull'd out a    #
Table-Book and
Scribbled, and he call'd for a Pen and Ink below Stairs, before he   #
went out, so
fearful were they both to forget the precious Moment.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] What was thy Part?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] I'll tell you, (^Mr, Inquisitive^) ;           #
(^Beau Smyrna^) made Love to me
with ends of Tag'd Lines, shewing his Teeth, and Diamond Ring, which
with a fine parcel of (^China^) , and a rare Pad, he said he would   #
present me; I
very honestly and innocently went and told (^Mrs. Smuggle^) , to ask #
her Advice.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Good, and she fell into Fits.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Exactly; So poor (^Smyrna^) fled the Pit, and  #
was forced to go down
Stairs and Drink in his own defence.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] What became of (^Fripponiere^) ?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] I told you before, he had too much of my       #
Conversation, as he
call'd it, but the Tawny Satyr finding (^Mrs. Rachel^) engag'd, flew #
at the old
Midwife and (^Mrs. Goggle^) , hugg'd them up most vigorously, and    #
after an
admirable medly of Discourse of railing at the (^English^) making    #
Love, and
Persecution, it ended in an appointment of a private Meeting with    #
(^Goggle^) , which (^Mrs.
Smuggle^) over-hearing Scolded as vehemently at him, as before she   #
Cry'd about
(^Smyrna^) .
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Grammecy, pious (^Refugee^) , he flies as briskly #
at Game of all Ages, as
he does at all sorts of Trade, Diamonds and old Shoes.
<P 10>
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] How did my Brother (^Smuggle^) behave himself?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Why he talk'd impudently to Mrs. (^Goggle^) ,  #
and she answer'd him
with as lewd Meanings in the Godly Phrase; he prais'd the            #
Resemblance of his
Child, which was no more like him than I am to a Negro, 'twas the    #
Picture of
(^Smyrna^) ; and then went down to drink with the (^Jew^) , the      #
(^Owler^) , and his Pimp
the Livery Stables-Man by (^Moor-fields^) .
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] What pity it was you could not hear their blessed #
Conversation!
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Yes, indeed I did, for I got into (^Mrs.       #
Smuggle's China^) Closet in
the drawing Room, and heard all; but such a Confusionn of Villanous  #
Stuff did
I never hear before; the (^Kentish^) Fellow Swore like a Tinker, and #
Sung Songs as
Nasty as himself.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Did not my Neighbour reprove him?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Yes, till he began to publish some of          #
(^Smuggle's^) Female
Adventures, for which his Champion the Horsecourser and he had like  #
to have gone
to Loggerheads but then they came to a Composition; for the          #
(^Owler^) by the
help of a preparative Mornings Draught of Punch fell asleep, and     #
Spew'd upon
the (^Damask^) Couch
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] How far'd the (^Beau^) ? His Pippin Pate can't    #
bear Drink.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Drunk he was, and fell foul upon (^Satanago^)  #
for his buying two
(^Phanatick^) Fatherless pretty Sisters of (^Mrs. Goggle^) , they    #
were her Half-boarders,
she prefered them to him to be his Hand-Maids, one at his City, the  #
other at
his Country House.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] VVhat said the Unbeliever?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] He cry'd it was meer Scandal, That they were   #
to be Richly
married to two of his Nation in (^Holland^) ; and meer spight in     #
(^Smyrna^) , because he
had out-bid him, and got from him the Exchange VVoman's fair Hair'd
Prentice Girl.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] A very whimsical Controversy!
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] The (^Beau^) then swore he'd Cuckold the       #
(^Hebrew^) with all three of
them; and the enraged (^Jew^) bid him if he durst, he'd get his      #
Master and
Father acquainted with his way of Living; and what was worse, swore  #
in (^French^) ,
which the others understood not, That he would let (^Mrs. Smuggle^)  #
know of his
Intentions, which immediately silenced the (^Beau^) .
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] The Frenchman staid above?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Yes, till he had made his Peace with a Gold    #
Snuff-Box; but I
believe it will cost poor (^Smirna^) all he proffered me, before his #
angry Lady
Regent will receive him into Grace, she has a notable way of         #
managing with
her; one would not think one with no more Education than she had by  #
being
an Alderman's Ladies Chamber-Maid, should be such a Politician.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] O Madam, the Lady has, I presume, a double stock  #
of Love about her,
she is doubly or trebly Mann'd to dispose of that Treasure, and must #
needs
have a double Portion, of what you call high Spirit, to govern her   #
Subjects.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] What do you call it, Captain?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] We Men are uncomplaisant Creatures, and may give  #
it the course Name
of Devilism.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] Right, Captain, sincerely a Woman might be         #
contented with Letchery,
and not add Malice, Wrath, and Covetousness to it.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Foul Mouth, hold your scurvy Tongue. When the   #
Monsieur came down,
<P 11>
(^Smirna^) was sent for up; but, I guess, the business was not       #
ended, for he's to
have his Charge tomorrow, when (^Smuggle^) goes out of Town.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] How did (^Fripponniere^) make up the Chorus?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Most admirably; for from Ribaldry above        #
Stairs, Drink put
him into a Fit of Zeal below, he Drank, he Swore, and talk'd Bawdy,  #
and [^SOURCE TEXT HAS and and AT LINE BREAK^] 
all for the (^Protestant^) Religion, Contradicted every body,        #
Interrupted all that
spoke, till he and the (^Jew^) fell into a close Conference in       #
French, about Pimping
for an old Peer, and bubling a Countess in a Diamond Necklace; and   #
then I
left them Drunk, Mrs. (^Smuggle^) in Fits for her Lovers, Mrs.       #
(^Goggle^) in Vapours
for too much Liquour, and (^Rachel^) stealing from her, and the      #
Midwife asleep.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] What say you to our Argument?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Hold, Sir, none of your Fustian till after     #
Supper, it may chance
to vex me.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] You see, Madam, what reason I had, not to be      #
there considering the Company.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Very true, either the Fops Impertinence, the   #
Frenchman's
Impudence, or the rest of the Knaves might have provok'd your        #
Resentment, for they
have no more Manners than Honesty, or else you'd have sat silent,    #
for your
Conversation with them would have made as unnatural a peice of       #
Patchwork
as Velvet [^SOURCE TEXT: Vevet^] and Brocade upon a Hop-Sack.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] But sincerely, (^Satanago^) is Master of           #
Languages, and an ingenious Fellow.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] So is many a Fellon in (^Newgate^) , must he   #
therefore be Convers'd with.
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] He is very Rich, who knows but he may be Knighted?
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Not in this Reign, I'm sure, (^English^)       #
Honours will no more be
prostituted to Foreign Wretches and Infidels.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I heard that upon my Lord (^Ready-Money           #
Gridiron's^) getting the (^Jew^)
Knighted, a Wag writ a Congratulatory Discourse between three        #
Knights [^SOURCE TEXT: Knignts^] , Sir
(^Loyn^) , Sir (^Reverence^) , and Sir (^Solomon Medina^) .
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] I fancy it will make a pretty Figure in        #
History hereafter,
especially when a (^Dutch^) Tapster improv'd into a Gamster, should  #
be farther improv'd
into a Baronet for being a private Spy, and a publick Adulterer;     #
when Titles
and the Noblest Ensigns of Honour are given to such as have no       #
Father, or --
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Sacred Robes to a Foreigner that has no Religion.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Right, Captain, it will look as Ridiculous as  #
putting the Sinews of
War into the Hands of a Profligate Unaccountable, as well as         #
Unaccounting
Bankrupt.
   [$ (^N.^) $] You are a Fool, forsooth; What care People for Satyr #
when they have Money?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] VVell said, Mammon; And do these Money-mongers    #
care for any but
themselves? VVhat good will the (^Jew's^) or (^Smuggles^) VVealth do #
you? I dare
say, neither will make you their Heir, nor because they are wealthy  #
can you
hope to buy a better Bargain of them, indeed by joining in indirect  #
Practices with
them, they may clap a (^Leven^) into that part of your Wealth that   #
is honestly gotten.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] True, (^Captain^) , I will have Conversation,  #
aye and Dealing too, left
off with them both, especially (^Smuggle^) , and rather than want of #
Profit should
be an Excuse, I, for my share of it, will go in Sack-Cloath, feed upon
Ship-Bisquet, and lie in a Thatcht Cottage rather than have the      #
Reputation
of my Husband Linck'd with that of two such Villains.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Fairly Offer'd, Madam. Faith, Mr. (^Trap^) ,      #
you'll not find many such
VVives; I am sure (^Smuggle^) would not do so.
<P 12>
   [$ (^Neh.^) $] VVell, I agree to it, and must own, That with such #
Gain, there are
such Hazards that shall be nameless, which I'll run no longer.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] For Mrs. (^Smuggle^) , it was my Husbands       #
importunity made me
acquainted with her; The violent Temper, base Principles, and foul   #
Feeding of
that Lady, made me ever have an Aversion for her.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Some such Spouses, I suppose, gave occasion to    #
that old Languag'd
(^French^) Sonnet Monsieur (^Bruyere^) praises so much, it is a good #
one, and I promised
you to get it translated, because, tho' a Satyr on your Sex, you     #
lik'd it.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] O good Captain! I'm sure you did not go far to  #
have it done.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Don't Scandalize me with the Imputation of Rhime.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] I remember I have heard you quote a (^Spanish^) #
Saying, That (^a
Gentleman was an Ass that could not make a Stanza, and a Coxcomb if  #

As well as I love it, I think (^Poetry^) is an agreeable             #

don't let us be interrupted by any of the Brutes that us'd to come   #

   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Right, Madam. And, Sir, if I should chance to see #

   [$ (^Mr. T.^) $] Now, (^Captain^) , will you not own that the     #
Land needs Reforming from
Swearing, Whoring, Drinking and Sabbath-breaking, of the Soldiery
and Gentry?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Yes, as well as from (^Lying, Cheating,           #
Forswearing, Hypocrisy,
Envy, Heresy^) , and (^Constant Moderate Bibbing^) of the Trading    #
Sober part of the Nation.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] We put our helping Hand to Reformation, if you    #
did your
Endeavour so --
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Every one speak in his own Station. My Soldiers   #
dare no more Swear
in my Presence, than your Prentice in yours; and when my Subalterns, #
or
Staff Officers give me the Character of an Incorrigible foul Mouth'd 
Swearer, he is Stript and Cashier'd for a Profligate.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] But (^Whoring^) , Captain, (^Whoring^) , How is   #
that Punished?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] By the (^Pox^) , (^Trap^) , the (^Pox^) ; That is #
a Feat is seldom done in
Publick, but if a Rake does discover his Sin by the Punishment, then #
(as it is said
in (^Sir Fopling^) ) I assure you he Rots for an Example.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] But the (^Sabbath^) --
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] When they are upon Duty, they don't break it, and #
when
off, the Churchwardens and Constables look after them like other     #
People,
and I believe there are as many Prentices and Journeymen taken and   #
punished,
as Soldiers; As for Drinking, much more, for they have more Money to #
spend
out of Two Shillings or Half a Crown a day, than a Soldier his Two   #
Pence out of Six
for (^Geneve^) , or now and then a Cup of good Liquor out of 2       #
(^s.^) from a Horseman.
   [$ (^N. T.^) $] And the Officers who looks after them?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I can answer but for one positively, but can give #
a pretty good Guess
at those I think worth my Friendship and Acquaintance. Come Mr.      #
(^Trap^) , (^ (\ad 
Hominem\) ^) [$ (^ (Laughs) ^) $] let your Lady be judge who is      #

   [$ (^Capt.^) $] No Madam, I make your Breast the Court of Equity  #
for Innocence,
and stand so much on my Justification, that I appeal as far as       #
Appearances, (and
that's what he most covets to save) even to the Spouse of his Bosom, #

is a Gentlewoman and no Reformer.

   [$ (^Mr. Tr.^) $] This is Uncharitable.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Nay (^Trap^) , I'll commend thy Zeal, rather than #
Charity, that will sooner
give five Shillings to have a poor Devil Whip'd or Stock'd, than six #
pence to
Relieve a poor Starving Family.
   [$ (^Mr. Tr.^) $] And the Play-Houses.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] There's much to be said against them, and         #
something for them, only, I
have observ'd the Closest Bargains have been made between            #
(^Damsels^) and grave
(^Camblet Cloaks^) in the (^Middle Gallery^) , and Un-Sworded        #
(^Esquires^) and Mask'd (^Lady
Errants^) in the (^Pit^) , and the Passages to it.
   [$ (^Mr. Tr.^) $] And all the Ladies of (^Drury-Lane^) ,          #
(^Covent-Garden^) -- [$ (^Capt.^) $] Wou'd
quickly go to Service, hard Labour, or the Plantations, if the       #
wealthy
Contributions from Sly, grave, Transgressors, did not uphold them; A #
Rake can't pay,
and his very Acquaintance blows up the little gawdy Sinner.
   [$ (^Mr. Tr.^) $] Well, What wou'd you Reform in Us People of     #
Business?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] First, the imprudent Education of your Children,  #
you either breed 'em
(^Fops^) , or private (^Rakes^) and open (^Hypocrites^) , make the   #
young Fellows Prove
without (^Brains^) and (^Sense^) , and the worst (^Husbands^) in the #
World. And the young
Women Half-bred, Vain and Proud, and the worst Wives in the Universe.
   [$ (^Mr. Tr.^) $] What for our Wives!
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] They Marry for Covetousness and Vanity, and are   #
justly punish'd for
it in you. I'll leave you and (^Mrs. Trap^) to read (^Lectures^) on  #
all the (^Mrs.
Smuggles^) of your Acquaintance.
   [$ (^Mr. Tr.^) $] What else?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Let your (^Sons^) and (^Prentices^) leave off     #
their Galloping (^Horses^) and (^Hunters^) .
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Their Expensive Journeys.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Yes, till they learn to Cheat as well as Trade by #
Whole-Sale, that is,
break. Their (^Epsom^) Expeditions, and all the little               #
(^Bawdy Inns^) , and
(^Warren-Houses^) about (^Epping-Forrest^) and (^Enfield-Chace^) .   #
Not forgetting some Naval
Expeditions.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] Ay Sir --? Then I am resolv'd you shall Sell   #
your Share in that
cursed Yatch.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Look you Neighbour (^Trap^) , if you Cheated her  #
Majesty in her Customs no
more than I in my Musters, you need not be in Subjection to several  #
dirty Rascals.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Leave off that odious Practice, or by my Life,  #
I'll peach thee my
self tho' I starve.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Then for the (^Jews^) . (^Mr. Trap^) , they are   #
no Reformers.
   [$ (^Mrs. Tr.^) $] I dare Swear -- [$ (^Capt.^) $] Let their      #
Brother Knaves take them to Task
with their Servants, Wenches, and Concubines, they're not content to #
make them
forfeit their Virtue and Modesty, but they must farther (^Debauch^)  #
them, to
clench their (^Damnation^) , and renounce their (^Christianity^) .
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] O horrible! [$ (^Capt.^) $] You'll hear more of #
that hereafter; a Generous
Convert from them has promis'd to lay open the Iniquities of Satan's #
Factors,
that Trade by Commission from the Devil. There are as many Laws in   #
force
against (^Judaism^) as (^Whoring^) .
<P 15>
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] What was thy Chief End in making thy self a     #
Publick Nuisance,
that is such a kind of Reformer?
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] I'll spare him the Labour of Speaking and         #
Blushing too, it was to be
before-hand with the World, that it might not observe him: to gain   #
the
Confidence of a Party he thought most to his Interest to be talk'd   #
of for such things,
rather than for Closer, I do not say worse.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Yes, his Breeding, first under a (^Phanatick    #
Master^) , and afterwards
his (^Education^) in that Virtuous Place, (^Amsterdam^) , had rarely #
fitted him for it.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] He found it was easier to be a Censurer of other  #
People, and a
Pharasaical (^Sabbath Keeper^) , than a Man of Justice.
   [$ (^Mr. T.^) $] Sir, I read good Books, and enquire into Religion.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] Have a care of your enlarg'd Thoughts, your       #
(^Dutch^) and (^Scotch^)
Linsie-Woolsey (^Divinity^) . There are many of you that             #
Coxcomically aim at
Learning, and Read without Guides, till you have blunder'd thro' all #
Reveal'd
Religion. A (^Deist^) is a Jewel to many of you; but it's not fit to #
publish what I
know on that Subject.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] By my Life, (^Mr. Trap^) , you're worsted.      #
Come, take our Advice,
Live like an (^Englishman^) , a good Natur'd Man, and a Gentleman,   #
reform your self.
   [$ (^Capt.^) $] And if a Preacher in Red that desires to be thy   #
Friend, may be believ'd,
thou wilt find an easy Temper, a clear Conscience, a sound got       #
Estate, much
more comfortable than the Applauses of Villains, indirect Dealings,  #
and the (^Cries^)
and (^Curses^) of the Oppress'd.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Captain, we have conquer'd, he's gone           #
confounded; I'll pursue the
Blow, and I hope he'll be convinc'd, and Honest, and Easy, and I     #
Happy hereafter.

LONDON

[^FIRST LETTER OMITTED.^]
<P 16>
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Madam, your humble Servant, I'm glad of your    #
good Company;
a Fellow Travellor of your Fashion will make me Amends for my
five Miles Pennance.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Sir, I believe your Pennance will continue, for #
Women generally
help to make your Sex Uneasy, at least if we may believe you.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Why Madam, that's as they are; but my Deaf and  #
Dumb Neighbour
wou'd make a much better Wife than a Companion.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Then you think they can't be found in one. God  #
help our Sex since
the Generality of Mankind have such an Opinion of us; it's in vain   #
for us to
hope for one that's a Husband and Friend.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Madam, Education fits Mankind for Friendship,   #
your soft Sex is
design'd for Love.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] O wretched! If both Love and Friendship are not #
so united both in
Man and Woman, as never to be parted. But, Sir, I never experienc'd  #
either,
Love has not yet reach'd me, I frankly own; Nor have I ever found    #
such a
Treasure as a Friend, but in my Relations; Yet I should be glad to   #
be inform'd
what sort of Education that is which fits your Sex for so Noble a    #
Thing as
(^Friendship^) is describ'd to be in the few Books I've read.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Why Madam, Do you ever read?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Sir, it's suppos'd I don't always say my        # 
(^Prayers^) without Book.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] But I mean, Madam, for Improvement of the Mind.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] That I can't tell; What if only for Amusement   #
and Diversion.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] O Madam! That indeed best becomes your Lovely   #
Sex, and most
Lovely self, the rest should be left to us.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] O barbarous! This is like (^Julian^) the        #
Apostate; you'd use the
Women as bad as he did the (^Christians^) , and deprive them of the  #
Advantages of
Learning.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] Lord Madam, you are vers'd in Antiquity! Don't    #
you understand (^Latin^) ?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Really no Sir, I have not that Happiness.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] It is a Happiness indeed which I often pity you #
Women have not for
your Improvement.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Does it make one Wittier or Wiser?
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] O yes, by knowing the Antient Poets, Orators,   #
and Philosophers.
<P 17>
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Sir, That's their Wit and Wisdom you read, and  #
not yours; but we
have it in their Translated Books. Must their Sense always go along  #
with their
Language?
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Ever Madam, the Spring head, the Fountain is    #
only to be valued,
and those who imbibe from thence.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Then there never was a Wity or Wise Man, or one #
to be valued, but
who understood (^Latin^) or (^Greek^) ?
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Very true, the others are but a sort of         #
Superficial Fellows, that only
take things upon Trust.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Sir, with Submission, to pass away half an Hour #
of this ill Weather,
I'll Discourse this Matter a little; but I've one Favour to ask.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Any Madam, you may command me entirely. But what?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] That is, that you'll keep your Temper; for I    #
have heard a Noble
Friend of my Father's say, That he never met with Learned (^Latin^)  #
and (^Greek^) 
Scholars, that ever cou'd have Patience when their Venerable         #
Antiquity, (^Latin^) 
and (^Greek^) Languages were attack'd.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Then he was an illiterate Wretch, and           #
understood them not; How
else durst he attempt such Impudent Nonsence?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Look you Sir, how true a Prophet am I? You see  #
you are not Proof
against it. Your Darlings and Favourites are no more to be touch'd,  #
than a
Substantial Merchant's Credit, or a Soldier's Point of Honour.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] Ha, ha, ha! Madam, you've Caught me I own; but  #
it's what
hitherto I'm a stranger to. I humbly beg your Pardon, you have free  #
Liberty to
Scoundrel the most Venerable (^Homer, Aristotle, Virgil^) and        # 
(^Horace^) , and Scout the
Sacred Languages down to the degree of the Clucking of the (^Cape^)  #
of (^Good Hope^) ,
(^Hottentots^) or (^Gipsies^) Cant; and use the Teachers and Readers #
of the Antient
Sages as Scurvily and unmercifully as --
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] A Witty Woman does a mere Scholar. But Sir,     #
this Gentleman
I mention'd, was both the Ornament, and a Happy Instrument of the    
State, a brave Soldier, a Wise Senator, Speaking and Writing three   #
or four
Languages of (^Europe^) , a Traveller, and most useful Mathematician.
   [$ (^Ch. Cl.^) $] What! and not understand (^Euclid^) ?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Again Sir? May he not understand the Nature of  #
a Circle, or a
Triangle, and Employ them to the Benefit of Mankind without the very #
Words
and Language of (^Euclid^) ; he was in Years when I saw him, and I   #
not ten Years
of Age, and yet so Universal, Pleasant, and Agreeable a Man, that we
Children as much admir'd him as our Parents.
   [$C. C.$] This is a single Instance.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] That's enough to make it possible; but had you  #
convers'd with the
World half so much as your Authors, you'd find Numbers in the Glory  #
and Prop of
our Nation, Navigation, and in the Revenues, Privy Council, Army,
Engineers, (^&c.^) The (^French^) King did not fetch (^Turene^) or   #
(^Luxemburg^) from the
College; Nor are his Forts, his Havens, and mighty Works built by    #
School-masters,
(^Horace-Mongers^) , or (^Homerians^) , and our Noble and Wonderful  #
Sir (^Walter
Rawleigh^) went young into the World, and owed most of the Great     #
Knowledge he
had of (^Greek^) and (^Latin^) , to his barbarous Usage and Prison;  #
his Gallant Actions
he performed without it.
   [$C. C.$] You are a Historian too, and give Admirable Instances.  #
Surely
Madam, you must have read much.
<P 18>
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] No truly Sir, and never one line of (^Latin^) .
   [$C. C.$] But Madam, How came the Gentleman you mention'd, (who   #
by your
Ingenious Description must be a Great Man) to be destitute of the    #
Learned
Languages?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] As my Father told me, 'twas because he was bred #
under an
Impudent ill natur'd Rascal of a School-Master, one so much a Clown  #
himself, he
either cou'd not find out, or hated the Gentlemen in another.
   [$C. C.$] Madam, Scholars are not bred without Manners.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Where shou'd they learn them? Among Lying,      #
Orchard Robbing
Boys, or by Smoaking and Ale-Bibbing, or Capping in a Quadrangle:    #
but this
(^Latin^) Thrasher, so Scourg'd and Buffetted Learning into him,     #
that the Sound
of (^Latin^) was as Terrible to him, as (^Turkish^) and (^Arabique^) #
is to a (^Spanish^)
Sea-Coast Village at Midnight, when a small Fleet of (^Moors^) ,     #
with their Musquets,
Cymetars, and Shackles surprize it. He hated a (^Roman^) as much as  #
ever a (^Russ^)
or (^Polander^) did a (^Tartar^) .
   [$C. C.$] Smartly express'd, but Madam, the (^Romans^) were the   #
Worthiest and
Noblest People in the Universe.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Yes, witness their Gladiators, and beastly      #
Dealing with their best
Prisoners of War. Not all the united Crimes of those Nations they    #
call'd
barbarous, ever came up to it. But Sir, I shan't disparage your      #
Friends, whose
Vertues you find in their own Poets; and the Christian Apologists,   #
(^Minntius^) ,
(^Foelix^) , (^Tertullian^) , (^Arnobius^) , &c. for they are in     #
(^French^) . This Gentleman us'd to
say, The Cry of Fire in a Ship, of Surprize and Slaughter in a       #
Beat-up Quarter,
which he afterwards experienc'd, made not that dismal Impression on  #
him, as
the Grammar Rules when rattled over him by this evil Genius of       # 
(^Syntaxis^) .
   [$C. C.$] Madam, 'tis impossible to learn a Language without      #
Rules and
Grammar, and [^ONLY "d" OF "and" VISIBLE IN SOURCE TEXT^] our Method #
of Teaching them.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] The general [^ONLY "neral" OF "The general"     #
VISIBLE IN SOURCE TEXT^] Expression was (how true I know not) That   #
his wretched
Master would have [^ONLY "wo" AND "e" OF "would have" VISIBLE IN     #
SOURCE TEXT^] kept him seven Years, to learn to make Files, Axes,    #
Hatchets,
Saws, Plains, and Hammars to do a Work but of two Years, when he     #
might
have all his Tools made to his Hands. I guess'd at his Meaning, and  #
imagine a
Language was made before Grammar, that does but Polish the Work, and
often spoil it. Pray Sir, how long were you at School?
   [$C. C.$] Nine Years, Madam!
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] And were not you Scourg'd and Beaten?
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] O Immoderately! Madam.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] What did you learn in that time?
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] (^Latin^) and (^Greek^) , and to write a pretty   #
Scurvy Scholar's Hand.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] I suppose you speak them Accurately well.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] O Madam, that's not usual, we don't speak them;   #
that's a Custom but
of some Foreigners; Perhaps by practice with them, I cou'd be        #
brought to
Speak them; tho' not so Readily, yet in a more Accurate Phrase. But  #
we pretend
to Write and Understand an Author.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Then for Speaking, you are to go to School      #
again, I perceive. But
had you Arithmatick and Geography?
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] That Madam, I learn'd since.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Sir, I beg you'd pardon me the Impertinence of  #
some Questions.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] Your Ingenuity and Goodness commands me, Madam.
<P 19>
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Can you Speak, Read, and tolerably Write        # 
(^French^) ?
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] Madam, I have eight Months since, by the Help of  #
a (^Grammar,
Dictionary^) , and a (^French Refugee^) , began to learn it, and can #
pick out the Meaning of an
Easy Author; but I can't pretend in a Year or two to hope to speak   #
or write it.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Can you Design, or Paint, and Japan, or Distill?
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] One requires a Genius for it, and Practice, and a #
good Master; and
the other I may know when I go through a Course of Chimistry.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Can you Sew, Knit, Spin, Embroider, make Lace   #
and Fringe; Silk
and Wax-Work; Dance, Sing, Play on the Harpsicord, Raise Paste,      #
Preserve!
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] Heavens! Madam, these are Womens Work.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Yet all these, I may without Vanity say, in     #
less than four Years, I
learn'd, and never was once Scourged; and that you may not suspect   #
any
Extraordinary Genius; a Dozen more Girles learned almost the same,   #
and as well.
With almost any two of these, well apply'd to, I could gain an honest
Livelihood in most parts of (^England^) , (^Scotland^) ,             #
(^Ireland^) , or the (^Plantations^) , where it's
probable the Lot of a Native of (^England^) may fall; with           #
(^French^) , I am a stranger
in almost no Part of (^Europe^) . Sir, pray, should you be taken a   #
Slave by an
(^Algerine^) , or a (^Sally Man^) , who have not the Fear and        #
Reverence of (^Latin, Greek^) ,
and their Authors before their Eyes, What could you do, to save your #
self from
Drubbing?
   [$C. C.$] Work and Dig if I had my Limbs.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] That a (^Negro^) could do as well, who had      #
never been Nine years at
School, to learn (^Homer^) , (^Virgil^) , (^Horace^) , and           #
(^Terence^) . Suppose such a thing should
happen (for to as easy bred, and as well born as you it has) Would   #
you not
willingly part with some of your (^Metaphysicks^) , (^Logick^) , old #
(^Philosophy^) , or (^Latin^) Poetry,
to be able to make a (^Horse-Shoe^) , a (^Saddle^) , or a (^Pair of  #
Boots^) , to help to gain
your Liberty or Ease? And yet these are Learnt to Perfection in half #
the Time,
and with half the Expence.
   [$C. C.$] Madam, you have almost confounded me; but our Learning  #
is for
Ornament, and to Improve our Souls in Thought and Contemplation.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] We live in (^England^) , and speak              #
(^English^) ; and I think (^Milton^) , (^Dryden^) ,
and (^Cowley^) , are as good Garniture for a Discourse as your       #
(^Latin^) Poets, if
Ornament be your end; and our Souls by a few (^Divinity^) and        #
(^Moral^) Books, may be
better fitted for Reflections on a future State, and our present     #
Being, than by
either (^Tully^) or (^Seneca^) , they Spoke and Thought well; and we #
(Improved by
(^Divine Revelation^) ) Speak and Think much better. But Sir, should #
you chance
not to get a (^Parsonage^) , or not take to (^Physick^) , or the     #
(^Civil Law^) , What would
you do with your Learning, even in (^England^) ?
   [$C. C.$] Get a (^Curacy^) , or Teach (^School^) , or be a        #
(^Tutor^) to some Gentleman's Son.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] What might that gain you a Year?
   [$C. C.$] Perhaps Forty, Fifty, or Sixty Pounds a Year.
   [$ (^M. T.^) $] What might your Father bestow on you a Year in    #
order to your (^Learning^) ?
   [$C. C.$] Madam, at School for the Nine Years, from 12 to         #
20 (^l.^) a Year; and at
the University, from 20 to 40 (^l.^)
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] A hard Return for such Time and Expence! A good #
Workman of
a (^Smith^) in our Neighbourhood, is not yet 30 Years of Age, has    #
got 80 (^l. per
Ann.^) Land, a (^Sadler^) 50, a (^Tanner^) 200. Two Masters of       #
Ships, one a (^West
Indian^) , the other a (^Baltick^) Trader, are Worth each 1500       #
(^l.^) All these, I've been
<P 20>
told, set out at the same time with my Brother, bred like you; but   #
their
Parents had the Grace to take them from Uncharitable Learning, and   #
he with his
Authors is not like to Improve his Moderate Estate a Penny, unless   #
the
Government will be pleased to give him a sort of a Gentleman's       #
(^Sine Cure^) , called
a Place.
   [$C. C.$] Your Air and Face, Madam, made at first an Extraordinary
Impression upon my poor Heart; but now your Wit and good Sense, your #
bright
Soul has quite Enchanted me.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] There it is, we can't displease in Discourse,   #
but all our Sex are
Satyriz'd for our sakes; and if we chance to please, then Love is    #
thrown about
at our Heads, as some do (^Greek^) and (^Latin^) for want of real    #
Knowledge.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] Faith Madam, it's a sign I have a real Value for  #
you, to Esteem you
for making me an Ass, and showing I've been Bred, and spent my Time  #
like
a Fool.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Well Sir, it's granted, I accept what you call  #
your Esteem and Love.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] Millions of Blessings and Ten Thousand Joys! --
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Hold -- No Raptures, for I have no Fortune.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] Your self alone is Heav'n and All --
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Which will not buy me a Twelve-penny Stuff      #
Mantua, you a Pair
of Shooes, or our Children Bread and Milk.
   [$C. C.$] To gain such a Felicity, What wou'd I not Attempt! What #
must I be
to gain you!
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] A Ship-Carpenter.
   [$C. C.$] Heav'ns! That's so foreign to my Education, that I must #
begin the
World anew.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] So you must to be any thing to purpose, but     #
that will always be of
use in (^England^) ; There if you Excel, you'll gain an Estate,      #
Reputation, and
the Comfort of being Useful; and a Satisfaction arising from all     #
these, will go
beyond the Empty, Ridiculous Pride of the most Towring Pedant.
   [$C. C.$] You might inspire me! --
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Hold -- Have a Care -- I am afraid you're       #
Infected.
   [$C. C.$] On my Soul, Madam, I'm Sound and Wholesome, and --
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] With Poetry, I mean, that word seems to be a    #
Symptom. Have
you not lost time enough with (^Latin^) Fustian?
   [$C. C.$] Are you not sensible of the Power of Numbers, Noble     #
Expression,
and well imag'd Truth. I heard you praise (^Milton^) , (^Cowley^) ,  #
and (^Dryden^) .
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Yes, I love it, and have been told our Language #
is as proper for it
of all kinds as the most boasted of Old: So I love Musick extreamly, #
but I
would not marry a Fidler.
   [$C. C.$] To obtain you, Madam, that you might be the Reward of   #
my Labour,
I wou'd Study --
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Till you made your self very Dull. Take care of #
that, Observe and
Read Mankind and your self; he that Encumbers himself up with other  #
Folk's
Stuff, has hardly room for his own. But what Insolence I am upon to  #
instruct
a Man of Education?
   [$C. C.$] I wish some body with their well turn'd Thoughts had    #
Instructed my
Parents, who were Ambitious to make me a Scholar, and knew not what  #
it
was, or what good for. But Madam, since you are gone so far as to    #
lay things
<P 21>
before me in a light, I am infinitely pleas'd with, and what I knew  #
not before;
For Heavens sake continue, pray tell me what you'd advise me to?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] You see I've had a fair Field of Ridicule, had  #
you been full of your
self; but since you are so good Natur'd as to accept of a            # 
(^Missionaire^) in
Petticoats of 21 (for Sir, I'll as frankly own my Standing, as you   #
your Degree.)
I'll advise you the best I can, with what I can recollect from       #
excellent Men and
Women; for I have, thank God, Convers'd with much better and Wiser   #
than
my self. First, Sir, as I am a Christian, I must enforce the Virtues #
that belong
to Christianity, among the rest Humility; You have had a Hint how    #
little able
you are to depend upon and Advance your self. Despise no man for     #
want of 
Quickness of Parts, Reparty, or any thing of the Fashionable         #
Waggery of the
Place you are bred in.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] What if my Genius soar above another's, Must the  #
dull Animal have
the Preference?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] I say that's no Consequence; but have a Care    #
while you are making
Verses and quaint Epigrams, he does not grow up to be a Man of Note, #
and
use, while you make Epigrams and Verses still.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Next have a care of (^Envy^) joyn'd with        #
(^Haughtiness^) , Confine not
Perfection to one Sett of Men, or their Particular way of Education; #
it's as
absurd and ill-natur'd as the (^Papists^) with the Pale of their     #
Church. You see how
useless the best of your boasted Gawdy Toppings are.
   [$C. C.$] How must I live in the World?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] By living in the World, and like one of it; and #
as it's presum'd you
are soberly bred. Be so, let not the Nauseous Porterly Trick of      #
Smoaking
overrun you; your Noble Places are Accus'd of having it learnt there.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] I think it for my Health, I cannot leave it.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Ridiculous, Consult an Ingenious and unbyass'd  #
Phys. He'll convince
you to the Contrary; and if for (^Physick^) take it as a Vomit       #
should be taken in its
proper time [^SOURCE TEXT: tiime^] and place. Endeavour to Converse  #
and be acquainted with Men of
Business, among them you'll find Conversation may be maintained,     #
without the
(^Bottle^) and (^Glass^) being the Essential part of the Company.
   [$C. C.$] A chearful Glass with Moderation --
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] -- Is an Excuse for frequent and nauseous       #
(^Bibbing^) . Must an Man of
Letters and Ingenuity be like a dry Pump, nothing to be got out of   #
him till you
pour Liquor into him. Were I one of you, I'd Scorn the briskness of  #
my Wit
and Mirth should be owing to any thing, but the Liveliness of my own
Imagination.
   [$C. C.$] No doubt, some Dull, Unconversable Fellows introduced   #
the Custom.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Yes, may be our Neighbours, who have left it,   #
and we have kept and
improved it. Why should a Man of Quality and Business, think going   #
to a
Tavern a Scandal; and you that think your self as Virtuous and more  #
Learned,
practise it? They seem to leave it to the Mobb of a higher Rank, I   #
would
Scorn to be reckoned one of the Number.
   [$C. C.$] Open-hearted Friendship, and Hospitable Entertainment,  #
were the first
Occasion of this Good Fellowship; and I'm ashamed when I reflect how #
it's
kept up by Clowns, or better Born People as Boorish. Madam, you are  #
in the
right, and even the beginnings of it should be carefully avoided.
<P 22>
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] To parallel in our own Sex, that Gayety and     #
Liberty of
Conversation, the (^French^) call Coquettry, has nothing really      #
Criminal in it at first, tho'
it Intrenches upon Maiden Decency, (at least so it seems to us) but  #
when
continued, it often leads to Crimes, but certainly to Scandal.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] Madam, may I beg to know who I am Oblig'd to for  #
this Instructing
and Delightful Conversation?
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] Sir, I am as willing to let you and all the     #
World know who I am, as
you can be to know. My Father Coll. (^Topping^) , had a Handsome     #
Gentleman's
Estate, which he Ruined with his Loyalty in the Civil Wars, in which #
he was a
Considerable Officer; the Remains of which maintains my Brother in   #
an Idle
Scholar's Life. My Mother died, and left my Sister and I very young. A
Noble Lady bestowed good Education on us, and took us home to her;   #
whence
my Sister married to an Honest, Industrious Citizen; They live       #
Lovingly,
and God has bless'd them with a Competent Estate, still Encreasing.  #
She it was
brought me to the Coach, from a pretty little Seat they have         #
Purchas'd. I am
in the same Noble Family stil, Respected as I'd wish; and am, thank  #
God,
Secur'd hereafter from the Injuries of the World, and Want in a      #
Moderate,
Humble, Single Life, by a bountiful settled Annuity. If ever I       #
change my
Condition, it must be to a Man of some Wealth, and I hope good       #
Humour,
else my small Maintenance will not Support us.
   [$C. C.$] Madam, May I hope for the Continuance of your           #
Friendship (I dare
name no more, till I am Worthy of more) and the Favour of an Answer, #
if I
should beg your Advice in order to Improvement, when Opportunity     #
offers.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] With all my Heart, and the Assistance of any of #
my Acquaintance,
to Serve you. But Sir, the same Question I must ask?
   [$C. C.$] My Father was younger Brother to Sir (^Humphrey         #
Classick^) , and by my
Mother, who liv'd but Six Years, had my Elder Brother and my self.   #
He spent
his Days in Drinking and Hunting; but however he rather Encreas'd    #
than
Diminished his Estate of 250 (^l.^) a Year. He died six Years since, #
and left my
Brother and me an Annuity out of it of 40 (^l.^) and a good Study of #
Books of
my Grandfather's. My Brother has taken to Grazing, and is very       #
Successful;
and they that know his Concerns better than I, say he'll raise a     #
Great Estate;
he is Unmarried, Moross and Close-fisted to all the World but my     #
self. Indeed
I never disobliged him, and we always Lov'd. He generally encreases  #
my
Annuity to 60 (^l.^) His Quarrel to me is like your Reflections,     #
(^for Book-Idleness^) , as
he calls it. I am of no Foundation, and therefore must the sooner    #
get out into
the World, and my Brother says he will Assist me; but Patrons I know #
none,
should I take Orders.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] By no means, Enter not into that Sacred         #
Function without a Call
in all Sences.
   [$ (^C. C.^) $] If Madam, your Soul (that has kindled me) can     #
enliven me to be
considerable in the World, and deserve your farther Favour, I then   #
will wait on you
out; and if in the mean time, some other Man is to be made Happier,  #
I beg to
have Notice of it.
   [$ (^Mrs. T.^) $] That I promise you. I think we have Chatted to  #
our Journeys End.
Sir,
(^Your Servant^) .
